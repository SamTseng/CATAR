TI Developing management education in the countries of the former Soviet
   bloc: critical issues for ensuring academic quality
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB If the countries of the former Soviet bloc are to move towards
   establishing successful market economies it is essential that their
   universities are able to design and deliver the highest quality
   management education. This education should stimulate innovative and
   independent thought along with developing skills that can be applied to
   the practical context of management. There has been a considerable
   number of international assistance projects targeted towards helping
   them achieve this objective. Nonetheless, this article questions how
   effective these projects have been. Central to this questioning are
   issues relating to the limited understanding that many lecturers have
   of real businesses situations. It is therefore proposed that, despite
   acknowledged difficulties, lecturers need to establish much closer
   contact with business. It is further proposed that designing new
   management curricula is, in itself, insufficient. Attention must be
   paid to issues of academic quality assurance, including rethinking the
   intended student learning outcomes and methods of student assessment.
   Only then will their management education achieve international
   standards.

TI Learning to play the drum: an experiential exercise for management
   students
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper proposes that introducing musical/percussion activities to
   university classrooms represents an opportunity for innovative teaching
   that could create positive experiences replete with learning potential.
   An analysis of 17 students' written reactions to a 'drumming circle'
   activity demonstrates that the experience created a positive, energised
   classroom climate. The value of the exercise was demonstrated in the
   observations that students made about how the experience engaged them
   emotionally and how it could be linked to insights about specific
   aspects of their programme of study. With some preliminary guidance
   provided in advance of the activity, students were able to identify
   analogies between aspects of the experience and topics within their
   management curriculum. The paper provides suggestions and ideas that
   can help teachers to introduce similar learning experiences into their
   own classroom settings.

ID TRANSACTIVE MEMORY; PERFORMANCE
AB This study investigated the social network structure of booking
   officers at the Honolulu Police Department and how the introduction of
   an online discussion tool affected knowledge about operation of a
   booking module. Baseline data provided evidence for collaboration among
   officers in the same district using e-mail, telephone and face-to-face
   media but showed minimal collaboration between officers in different
   districts. On average, knowledge of the booking module was low. After
   introduction of the online discussion tool the social network structure
   changed, showing an increase in collaboration between different
   districts and an increase in knowledge of the booking module, even
   though frequency of collaboration did not increase significantly. The
   study suggests that the formation of new collaborative ties is more
   significant for learning through information sharing in social networks
   than raw frequency of interaction. This work is framed by theories of
   knowledge building, social architecture, and communities of practice.

TI Institutional potential for online learning: A Hong Kong case study
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE online learning; E-learning; pedagogy; strategic planning; higher
   education; the University of Hong Kong
AB Hong Kong's tertiary education environment has changed dramatically in
   recent years with universities now facing specific educational
   challenges in the areas of critical thinking, 'life-long learning' and
   English language. The question exists as to what pedagogic developments
   will best allow the universities to address these challenges. In this
   paper, the appropriateness of online pedagogy as one response to these
   challenges is assessed through use of illustrative case-examples and
   post-course surveys. The potential of The University of Hong Kong (HKU)
   to implement this pedagogy is examined through a systematic
   consideration of the requirements for embedding online learning,
   specifically student and institutional knowledge, culture, and
   resources.
   The case examples provide empirical evidence to suggest that online
   environments are useful in addressing these challenges, largely as a
   consequence of afforded flexibility in teaching and learning, support
   of more student-centered learning approaches, and a high degree of
   student engagement. Opportunity for international collaborative
   teaching, with associated benefits in curriculum extension,
   cost-spreading and benchmarking, is also demonstrated. Within HKU,
   student factors appear to pose no major constraint to such development,
   but there exist significant inconsistencies in terms of institutional
   culture, pedagogic knowledge and non-hardware resources. The author
   concludes that small-scale online developments are viable and the cost
   of establishing and maintaining these need not be prohibitive. While
   online learning holds promise for HKU, the University will require
   internal institutional change to fully realize this potential.

TI Reuse- and aspect-oriented courseware development
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB No longer can courseware providers deal with one homogeneous target
   group, one learning form and possibly one pedagogical approach. Instead
   they must develop a broad range of courseware, each serving its
   specific target group, each adjusted to a specific learning and
   teaching form, each appealing to its own learning and teaching
   scenario, and each incorporating its own pedagogical approach, and to
   do all this in a cost-effective and timely fashion. The thesis of this
   paper is that only an approach that is much more dictated by software
   engineering principles than what has been usual so far will meet these
   needs. Because of the economical constraints, the overriding
   engineering principle should be component reuse, and if several
   distinctive concerns become interwoven - above all content, didactics
   and technology - component reuse should be augmented by aspect-oriented
   programming. The paper develops and details a novel courseware
   engineering process that combines software reuse, component technology
   and aspect-oriented programming.

DE online education; studio; faculty workload
AB Technology is transforming the education and practice of architecture
   and design. The newest form of education is blended learning, which
   combines personal interaction from live class sessions with online
   education for greater learning flexibility (Abrams & Haefner, 2002).
   Reluctant to join the digital era are educators teaching studio courses
   (Bender & Good, 2003), who may be unaware of the possibilities and
   benefits of teaching with technology. The argument proposed in this
   study is that blended learning will enhance studio courses. Studios are
   unique learning environments embedded in an historical context. This
   article presents a process of infusing a traditional studio with online
   technologies. The result is a more streamlined course that enhances
   student learning, provides targeted instruction to individual students,
   serves a larger group of students than a traditional studio, and does
   not increase faculty workload.

AB Multimedia is increasingly used to enhance human-computer interaction
   in a variety of formats (text, graphics, audio, animation, and video).
   The challenge is how to use the most effective presentation format that
   would result in performance improvement. This paper addresses the added
   value of video presentations in a technology-mediated learning
   environment for a basic Management Information System course at MBA
   level. We postulate two hypotheses that take into account students'
   mastery learning and satisfaction with regard to the usefulness of
   video presentation, moderated by students' self-interest to learn the
   subject matter (i.e., intrinsic motivation). Our analysis, on the basis
   of empirical research, shows that the subjects find a learning
   environment supported with video presentations is more useful. Their
   intrinsic motivation to learn the subject matter had a significantly
   positive effect on their satisfaction with the availability of video
   presentations. Video presentations had no significant effect on their
   performance on exams, however.

AB Educational software for teachers is an important, yet usually ignored,
   link for integrating information technology into classroom instruction.
   This study builds a web-based teaching material design and development
   system. The process in the system is divided into four stages,
   analysis, design, development, and practice. Eight junior high school
   history teachers participated in the evaluation of the system. Through
   experts' reviews and content analyses of their instructional materials
   and interviews, we found that instructional materials produced using
   the system appear to be more coherent and systematic, provide deeper
   and broader information for learning, apply more adequate teaching
   strategies, and lessen the design and development load on teachers.

ID UNCERTAINTY
AB During the last years, development of open learning environments that
   support effectively their users has been a challenge for the research
   community of educational technologies. The open interactive nature of
   these environments results in users experiencing difficulties in coping
   with the plethora of available functions, especially during their
   initial efforts to use the system. In addition, - from the tutors'
   perspective - the problem solving strategies of the students are often
   particularly difficult to identify. In this paper, we argue that such
   problems could be tackled using machine learning techniques such as
   Bayesian Networks. We show how we can take advantage of log files
   obtained during field studies to build an adaptive help system
   providing the most useful support to the student, according to the
   state of interaction. On the other hand, we attempt to support the
   tutor, by automating the process of diagnosing students' problem
   solving strategies using Bayesian Networks. The presented approaches
   are discussed through examples of two prototypes that have been
   developed and corresponding evaluation studies. These studies have
   shown that the proposed approach can effectively support the tasks of
   students and tutors in such open learning environments.

AB This paper is an attempt to describe the emergence and growing
   popularity of online distance education over the past 30 years through
   changing sociological lenses. Examining the re-casting of the
   electronic classroom through the euphoria of techno-positivism, the
   power-embedded analysis of Critical Theory of Technology (CTT), and the
   critique of postmodernism, the paper addresses the implications
   suggested by each theoretical interpretation. Using the metaphor of a
   high-speed train, we encourage administrators, instructors and
   technicians to stop and reflect on the destination, rather than simply
   marvel at the speeds at which we are traveling and the engine that
   powers our ride.

AB The purpose of this article is to suggest a research-based systemic
   plan for educational researchers, practitioners, and policymakers
   involved in the change process to implement successful technology
   integration in the context of teacher education. This article provides
   a background about reform efforts in science education in the United
   States in recent years. This article also addresses technology tools
   that are responsive to reform efforts in the elementary science
   education and indicates the challenges of modifying elementary
   preservice teacher education to meet technology reform needs. The
   technology integration change process takes time and efforts; not all
   change can be sustained. Thus, a systemic plan that considers three
   major components, including people, process activities, and systems, to
   ensure successful technology integration is suggested.

AB Although much is written about reasons why students drop out of online
   courses, little is said about what makes them stay. This article
   reports on an experiment whereby online students were exposed to a
   learning experience modelled on the US television series Survivor.
   Twenty-four students were put into tribes and allowed to vote one
   another off the island at the end of each week. Students who were voted
   out of their tribes, were still on the course, but could no longer rely
   on the support of their peers. The course had a very high dropout rate,
   and students reported that the experience was extremely stressful. Yet
   there were fifteen students who completed the whole course. The
   question is why? This article identifies and discusses three aspects
   that contributed to the success of those who completed: The game
   metaphor, the roles and competencies of the facilitator, and the
   affective dimensions of peer support in a non-contact environment.

DE teacher professional development; dynamic web design; early childhood
   education; at-risk children
AB Research suggests the importance of professional development for
   teachers of at-risk children, and while educational technologies can be
   harnessed to help support teaching practice in innovative ways, such
   programs are often limited in scale. My Teaching Partner (MTP) was
   designed to deliver a targeted program of professional development for
   teaching quality, integrated with early childhood curricula, to large
   numbers of teachers. It has been used by 235 teachers of at-risk
   preschool children across the commonwealth of Virginia. MTP links
   curricula with layers of web-based support, including an on-line
   consultant--a teaching expert who regularly observes, de-briefs, and
   extends teachers' educational practice. The research-based curricula
   support the needs of at-risk Pre-K students in language, literacy, and
   social relationships; numerous video clips demonstrate effective
   teaching practice. In this paper, we describe the user-centered design
   process used and the support services and curricula delivered. The
   dynamic nature of the website is emphasized, including development
   practices which enable non-developers to easily contribute and maintain
   website contents. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this
   approach, and describe the field trial now underway, which includes
   examination of child outcomes, teaching quality, and teacher
   reflectivity. Evaluation data from the project are also summarized.

   Education category of the Technology Benefiting Humanity Awards, which
   started in 2001. Most of the applicants can be considered social
   entrepreneurs working to improve educational systems and the learning
   opportunities and experiences of their intended beneficiaries. While
   the benefits to humanity derived from educational technology are often
   taken for granted, the work of these 25 Laureates, working in countries
   around the world, provides an opportunity to critically examine how
   such benefits are actually obtained. Based on this analytical review,
   suggestions for further research and development in educational

AB This paper describes the interoperability underpinning a new strategy
   for delivering accessible computer-based resources to individual
   learners based on their specified needs and preferences in the
   circumstances in which they are operating. The new accessibility
   strategy, known as AccessForAll, augments the model of universal
   accessibility of resources by engaging automated systems and builds
   upon the previous development of libraries of suitable resources and
   components. It focuses on individual learners and their particular
   accessibility needs and preferences. It fits within an inclusive
   framework for educational accommodation that supports accessibility,
   mobility, cultural, language and location appropriateness and increases
   educational flexibility. Its effectiveness will depend upon widespread
   use that will exploit the 'network effect' to increase the content
   available for accessibility and distribute the responsibility for the
   availability of accessible resources across the globe. Widespread use
   will depend upon the interoperability of AccessForAll implementations
   that, in turn, will depend on the success of the four major aspects of
   their interoperability: structure, syntax, semantics and systemic
   adoption.

DE TEL engineering; TEL reengineering; TEL development process; model
   driven engineering
AB Specifications recently proposed as standards in the domain of
   Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL), question the designers of TEL
   systems on how to put them into practice. Recent studies in Model
   Driven Engineering have highlighted the need for a framework which
   could formalize the use of these specifications as well as enhance the
   quality of the developments. This paper deals with the opportunity for
   the TEL community to adopt such a model to express and formalize the
   design organization and the engineering process of a TEL system. This
   kind of model could provide a set of concepts allowing the description
   of specifying, modeling and analyzing tasks one needs to perform for
   defining the negotiation and the communication between actors in such a
   community. In a first part, we stress the need for the instantiation of
   this framework so as to integrate recent results as well as taking into
   account the evolution of software reengineering. In a second part, we
   propose two instances of this framework; the first concerns the reverse
   engineering of a TEL system and the second its reengineering.

ID KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION; MENTAL MODELS; EARTH; INSTRUCTION; PHYSICS;
   DESIGN; FORCE
AB Bearing in mind students' misconceptions about basic concepts in
   astronomy, the present study conducted a series of constructivist
   activities aimed at changing future elementary and junior high school
   teachers' conceptions about the cause of seasonal changes, and several
   characteristics of the Sun-Earth-Moon relative movements like Moon
   phases, Sun and Moon eclipses, and others. The activities and results
   concerning the cause of seasonal changes are reported. Both the
   experimental class and the control Groups improved their grasp of basic
   astronomy concepts statistically significantly, although the
   experimental class made the most impressive progress of all. Regarding
   subjects relevant to this study (seasonal changes), only the
   experimental class showed a statistically significant improvement,
   which justifies the constructivist approach. We conclude that in
   implementing a reform in the science curriculum, the change has to
   include the subjects taught and also the way they are taught. (c) 2006

AB We report a study of three prospective secondary science teachers'
   development of theories-in-action as they worked together in a group to
   explore collisions using both physical manipulatives and a computer
   simulation (Interactive Physics). Analysis of their investigations
   using an existing theoretical framework indicates that, as the group
   moved from physical experiments to the computer simulation, their
   attention shifted from planning their experiments to processing system
   feedback, which impeded the iterative refinement of their
   theories-in-action. The nature of the theories they developed also
   changed. Learners' attitudes toward science and prior experiences
   affected the exploration process in both environments. In particular,
   prior instruction in physics and an authoritarian view of science
   seemed to impede engagement in the development and testing of
   theories-in-action. Certain features of the computer system itself also
   impeded exploration. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study continues research previously conducted by a nine-university
   collaborative, the Salish I Research Project, by exploring science
   teachers' beliefs and practices with regard to inquiry-oriented
   instruction. In this study, we analyzed the relationship among
   secondary science teachers' preparation, their beliefs, and their
   classroom practices after completion of a course designed to provide
   authentic inquiry experiences. From Teacher Pedagogical Philosophy
   Interview data and Secondary Science Teacher Analysis Matrix
   observational data, we analyzed links between the teachers' conveyed
   beliefs and observed practice regarding the teachers' actions (TA) and
   students' actions (SA). Also presented is a listing of teachers'
   perceived influences from university preparation course work. Results
   indicated that 7 of the 8 teachers professed a belief in
   teacher-centered or conceptual style with regard to TA and SA. The
   observational results indicated that 7 of the 8 teachers displayed a
   teacher-centered or conceptual style with regard to TA and SA.
   Inconsistencies between interview and observational data were
   unexpected, as half of the teachers professed slightly greater
   teacher-centered styles with regard to TA than what they actually
   practiced in their classrooms. All teachers reported that an
   inquiry-based science course was valuable. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals,

TI Does one size fit all? The induction experience of beginning science
   teachers from different teacher-preparation programs
SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING

DT Article
ID BELIEFS; INQUIRY; IMPACT
AB The number of induction programs available to teachers is increasing
   rapidly, and by necessity these programs are designed to meet the needs
   of all teachers regardless of their preparation and academic
   background. This study examines the impact of a science-focused
   induction program on secondary science teachers from different
   preparation programs. The 16 teachers were first-year secondary science
   teachers who graduated the previous year from one of four different
   teacher-preparation programs. All teachers were monitored during their
   first year of teaching, as they participated in the induction program,
   to understand their teaching beliefs, instructional practices, and
   experiences in the classroom. The analysis of data revealed that the
   preservice training of a science teacher influenced the type of support
   the teacher derived from the science-focused induction program.
   Teachers from a preservice program with an extended student-teaching
   experience and two science methods courses held beliefs aligned with
   student-centered practices and implemented more reform-based lessons
   than did other teachers during the year. This study reinforces the
   importance of induction programs for teachers and suggests that there
   is a need for specialized support programs for beginning science
   teachers. The study also provides specific suggestions for improving
   the preparation of secondary science teachers. (c) 2006 Wiley

AB Empirical studies that focus on the impact of three-dimensional (3D)
   visualizations on learning are to date rare and inconsistent. According
   to the ability-as-enhancer hypothesis, high spatial ability learners
   should benefit particularly as they have enough cognitive capacity left
   for mental model construction. In contrast, the ability-as-compensator
   hypothesis proposes that low spatial ability learners should gain
   particular benefit from explicit graphical representations as they have
   difficulty mentally constructing their own visualizations. This study
   examines the impact that interactive 3D models implemented within a
   hypermedia-learning environment have on understanding of cell biology.
   Test scores in a subsequent knowledge acquisition test demonstrated a
   significant interaction term between students' spatial ability and
   presence/absence of 3D models. Only students with high spatial ability
   benefited from the presence of 3D models, while low spatial ability
   students got fewer points when learning this way. When using 3D models,
   high spatial ability students perceived their cognitive load to be low
   whereas the opposite was true for low spatial ability students. The
   data suggest that students with low spatial ability became cognitively
   overloaded by the presence of 3D models, while high spatial ability
   students benefited from them as their total cognitive load remained
   within working memory limits.

AB While simulations have widely been used to facilitate conceptual change
   in learning science, results indicate that significant disparity or gap
   between students' prior conceptions and scientific conceptions still
   exists. To bridge the gap, we argue that the applications of computer
   simulation in science education should be broadened to enable students
   to model their thoughts and to improve and advance their theories
   progressively. While computer simulations are often used to offer
   opportunities for students to explore scientific models, they do not
   give them the space to explore their own conceptions, and thus cannot
   effectively address the challenge of changing students' alternative
   conceptions. Findings from our recent empirical study reveal that,
   firstly, dynamic modelling using the environment WorldMaker 2000 in
   conjunction with the use of a cognitive perturbation strategy by the
   teacher was effective in helping students to migrate from their
   alternative conceptions towards a more scientifically inclined one;
   secondly, the pathways of conceptual change across groups were
   idiosyncratic and diverse. Respecting students' ideas seriously and
   providing cognitive perturbation at appropriate junctures of the
   inquiry process are found to be conducive to fostering conceptual
   change. In this paper, we will report on the details of the pedagogical
   approach adopted by the teacher and portray how students' conceptions
   change during the entire process of model building.

AB Owing to the emergence and flourishing of the Internet, traditional
   teaching and educational activities are increasingly relying on the
   convenient and global-reaching networking technology. To boost up the
   development of e-learning technology and the interoperability of
   learning materials, the Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative
   defined a data-sharing standard, called the Sharable Content Object
   Reference Model (SCORM). In SCORM, because all learning materials
   (either SCOs or assets) are sharable, users cannot share (or delegate)
   parts or all of their teaching materials at will. This paper proposed
   an access control and delegation model for SCORM conformant learning
   management systems. Also, a prototype was developed to demonstrate the
   feasibility of the proposed model.

ID COMPUTER ATTITUDE; PRESERVICE
AB Having in mind the need for an increased attention to the importance of
   pre-service teacher development concerning technology, this study
   examined teachers' interest to attain educational technology standards
   (Interest) in terms of their computer attitude (Attitude) and the
   professional support they received to attain these standards (Support).
   The study used a sample of 39 mathematics student teachers and 62
   elementary student teachers. The two groups only differed in Support
   favouring elementary student teachers, who, contrary to mathematics
   student teachers, received some basic instruction concerning ET
   standards.Despite these differences in Support, the two-group path
   analysis applied revealed that, for both student teachers, the direct
   effects of Support on Attitude and of Attitude on Interest were
   positive and significant. On the other hand, the total and direct
   effects of Support on Interest, although positive, were insignificant.
   However, because of significant indirect effects, the impact of Support
   on Interest was mediated through Attitude in both groups. These
   findings support the view that in order to develop Interest, Support
   should focus on developing Attitude, which may hold true in general not
   depending on student teacher type and the level of Support.
   Implications for further research and (pre-service) teacher
   professional development are examined.

AB When presented with the option to use a new instructional technology,
   students often face an approach-avoidance conflict. This study explored
   promotion and prevention orientations, concepts linked to approach and
   avoidance in Higgins's regulatory focus theory, in the choice to attend
   lectures or watch them online. Openness, a core disposition in the Big
   Five Model of personality, and positive attitudes towards the utility
   of the Internet, reflect promotion orientations that are potentially
   related to the choice to watch lectures online. By contrast,
   neuroticism, another core disposition in the Big Five Model, and
   anxiety about the Internet as a computer technology, reflect a
   prevention orientation that is potentially related to the choice of
   attending lectures in class. The results illustrate that both promotion
   and prevention are at work in the choice to attend lectures or to watch
   them online. Neuroticism and anxiety about the Internet as a computer
   technology were related to the choice to attend lectures in class,
   whereas the perceived utility of the Internet was related to the choice
   to watch lectures online. Instructional mode choice was not related to
   examination performance, suggesting that the choice to attend lectures
   or watch them online has more to do with individual differences in
   promotion and prevention orientations than with pedagogical
   characteristics that impact learning.

AB The paper reports a study that investigated the construction of a
   common identity in an online Italian forum of psychologists based on
   asynchronous CMC. Discourse analysis was carried out on 20 discussions,
   and three Interpretative Repertoires were identified: (i) Professional
   Boundaries, (ii) disempowered psychology and (iii) psychology and
   health, which refer to three recurrent modalities of constructing the
   psychological profession. The study suggests that a framework drawing
   on social constructionism and Bourdieu's critical theory can help
   understand some aspects of identity in, and across, communities of
   practice. The main conclusion is that analysing critically how
   identities are constructed in learning environments, virtual or not,
   allows reconsidering the role of the cultural context in the production
   of those identities.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB While public key cryptography is continuously evolving and its
   installed base is growing significantly, recent research works examine
   its potential use in e-learning or m-learning environments. Public key
   infrastructure (PKI) and attribute certificates (ACs) can provide the
   appropriate framework to effectively support authentication and
   authorization services, offering mutual trust to both learners and
   service providers. Considering PKI requirements for online distance
   learning networks, this paper discusses the potential application of
   ACs in a proposed trust model. Typical e-learning trust interactions
   between e-learners and providers are presented, demonstrating that
   robust security mechanisms and effective trust control can be obtained
   and implemented. The application of ACs to support m-learning is also
   presented and evaluated through an experimental test-bed setup, using
   the general packet radio service network. The results showed that AC
   issuing is attainable in service times while simultaneously can deliver
   flexible and scalable solutions to both learners and e-learning
   providers. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we describe an e-commerce teamwork-based project
   designed and implemented at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University
   (PolyU) for undergraduate business and management students. The
   teaching objectives of this e-commerce project are to develop the
   students' knowledge and skills, such as in the use of e-commerce site
   building tools, critical thinking, communication skills, teamwork, and
   entrepreneurship. We focus on the practical implications of the
   project-based teamwork approach in the teaching and learning of
   introductory e-commerce from a business context perspective. The
   results of an evaluation indicate that the project-based teamwork
   approach to teaching e-commerce performs to expectations. Our
   experience and student evaluations indicate that students like the
   practical components of the course and are interested in the use of the
   learning-by-doing approach. We believe that other business colleges
   with e-commerce curricula will benefit from this approach. (c) 2004

AB This paper describes a three-year study conducted among chemistry
   instructors (professors and teaching assistants) at a post-secondary
   institution. The goal was to explore the integration process of
   information and communication technologies (ICT) into traditional
   teaching. Four undergraduate chemistry courses incorporated a course
   website, an electronic forum, computerized visualizations, and
   Web-based projects, into their curriculum. The learning technologies
   were integrated to enhance inquiry-based learning, visualizations, and
   knowledge sharing. The current study investigated chemistry
   instructors' perceptions toward ICT and their activities while
   practicing the newly introduced technologies. The findings showed that
   integrating new practices is a phase-dependent process that consists of
   promises as well as complexities. Four transition steps were found to
   characterize the integration of ICT-learning environments: non-active,
   support-dependant, partial-independant, and total-independant. Findings
   indicated that the transition from traditional to ICT-enhanced learning
   environments involves ambivalent feelings and dichotomy among
   instructors. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An innovative concept of an electronic learning system has been
   established in an attempt to achieve a technology that provides
   engineering students with an instructive and affordable framework for
   learning engineering-related courses. This system utilizes an existing
   Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) package, Active Server Pages
   programming, Hyper Text Markup Language web page, and a database in the
   development of a user-friendly interface for the e-learning system. The
   structure of this learning system includes three components: a
   pre-processor which creates and defines the problems, a control program
   which links CFD package; searches for the identical problem with
   previously executed results or creates a new CFD execution and then
   saves the results in the database, and a post-processor which yields a
   graphic presentation of the computational results. This system would
   provide engineering students with a solid comprehension of the physical
   phenomena by changing the input parameters of a specific problem. (c)

AB Recent educational research from a socio-cognitive perspective has
   validated students' collaborative engagement with new technologies and
   heightened understanding of influential factors shaping the
   effectiveness of peer interactions, learning contexts and computer
   interfaces for enhancing learning. This paper focuses on an analysis of
   the complexity of knowledge in student-designed, electronically created
   texts for what they might reveal about learning with technology. It
   reports on a study with 17-year-old female students whose collaborative
   learning process in subject English was mediated by the creation of
   electronic concept maps and Web files to represent their developing
   understanding. To analyse these electronic texts, evaluative criteria
   templates were developed from the Structure of Observed Learning
   Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy, integrating levels of understanding with the
   distinctive characteristics of multimodal text production. Findings
   indicated not just the incremental acquisition of conceptual
   understanding equated with cognitive change but that the level of
   understanding might also be positively influenced by the students'
   length of exposure to computer-mediated learning practices. As well,
   the criteria templates have emerged as useful evaluative tools for
   classroom assessment or further research when analysis of the level of
   complexity of student-created, electronic artefacts is required. (c)

AB In this article, we report the observed differential uptake and use of
   computer programs and activities of seven boys and girls of high,
   medium and low attainment in a classroom in the UK where over 40
   children aged 10 and I I have a networked PC on their desk all day and
   every day. We observed the detail of what happened in the small space
   between the pupil and the screen over the period of I year in the
   social and instructional context of the classroom. We found interesting
   individual differences superseding the expected variation based on
   gender and attainment. We suggest some possible 'within child' and
   external factors which may contribute to these differences and consider
   some of the implications for teaching and learning through ICT and the
   need for further research to investigate the nature of these
   differences. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of the study was to examine the development of students'
   high-level computer skills and competence (student expertise) in
   information and communication technology (ICT), and to examine the
   characteristics of such expertise. Eighteen lower secondary school
   students, selected to represent both genders and all school achievement
   levels, were given laptops for three years to be used both at school
   and at home. The data of the longitudinal study consisted of a test on
   ICT skills; self-evaluation questionnaires on ICT competence, thoughts
   about their own expertise, ICT-related activities and task, interest in
   ICT, and classroom observations. The results of the study indicated
   that the intensive use of ICT and the process-oriented learning
   environment supported the development of student expertise. In the
   analysis, three groups were identified, which oriented themselves
   somewhat differently in relation to ICT: student experts (n=6),
   advanced users (n=8) and non-interested users (n=4). The experts
   differed from the other groups in respect of especially focusing on
   advancing their ICT skills; they had undertaken ICT-related tasks
   outside the school, they had metacognitive consciousness about their
   competence, and they had future plans concerning ICT in their further
   education and profession. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The two separate projects described have examined how teachers exploit
   computer-based technologies in supporting learning of science at
   secondary level. This paper examines how pedagogical approaches
   associated with these technological tools are adapted to both the
   cognitive and structuring resources available in the classroom setting.
   Four teachers participated in the first study, undertaken as part of
   the InterActive Education project in Bristol; all of them used
   multimedia simulations in their lessons. The second study presented was
   part of the wider SET-IT project in Cambridge; 11 teachers in eight
   schools were observed using multimedia simulations, data logging tools
   and interactive whiteboards. Teachers were interviewed in all cases to
   elicit their pedagogical thinking about their classroom use of ICT.
   The findings suggest that teachers are moving away from only using
   'real' experiments in their practice. They are exploring the use of
   technologies to encourage students to engage in "What If" explorations
   where the outcomes of 'virtual' experiments can be immediately
   accessed, for example through using a simulation. However, this type of
   activity can serve just as a mechanism for revealing - and indeed
   reinforcing students' informal conceptions if cognitive conflict is not
   generated or remains unresolved. The teachers in our studies used
   simulations, data logging, projected animations and other dynamic
   digital resources as tools to encourage and support prediction and to
   demonstrate scientific concepts and physical processes - thereby
   'bridging the gap' between scientific and informal knowledge. They also
   integrated technology carefully with other practical activities so as
   to support stepwise knowledge building, consolidation and application.
   Research of this kind has design implications for both
   curriculum-related activities and emerging computer-based learning
   technologies, in terms of helping us to understand how teachers
   capitalise upon the technology available in supporting students to
   construct links between scientific theory and empirical evidence. (c)

TI Towards a more authentic science curriculum: The contribution of
   out-of-school learning
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB In many developed countries of the world, pupil attitudes to school
   science decline progressively across the age range of secondary
   schooling while fewer students are choosing to study science at higher
   levels and as a career. Responses to these developments have included
   proposals to reform the curriculum, pedagogy, and the nature of pupil
   discussion in science lessons. We support such changes but argue that
   far greater use needs to be made of out-of-school sites in the teaching
   of science. Such usage will result in a school science education that
   is more valid and more motivating. We present an "evolutionary model"
   of science teaching that looks at where learning and teaching take
   place, and draws together thinking about the history of science and
   developments in the nature of learning over the past 100 years or so.
   Our contention is that laboratory-based school science teaching needs
   to be complemented by out-of-school science learning that draws on the
   actual world (e.g., through fieldtrips), the presented world (e.g., in
   science centres, botanic gardens, zoos and science museums), and the
   virtual worlds that are increasingly available through information
   technologies.

TI A vocationalized school science curriculum?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID EDUCATION; TECHNOLOGY
AB This article is concerned with the meaning and legitimacy of the view
   that the secondary science curriculum can be given a vocational
   emphasis, and with a current attempt to create such a curriculum.
   Although this perspective on the science curriculum has a long history,
   in recent decades it has received little attention. This article
   examines recent research into the vocational and work-related aspects
   of secondary school science, and the historical and policy background.
   Its empirical focus is a late secondary course with the title "Applied
   Science", which was introduced into schools in England and Wales in
   2002. It draws on the preliminary findings of a research study focusing
   on the origins and implementation of this course. Overall, the article
   provides an overview of the major issues and research agenda associated
   with the notion of a vocational or applied school science curriculum,
   focusing ultimately on the key issues of educational purpose, pedagogy,
   and status.

TI Knowledge restructuring in the development of children's cosmologies
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; MENTAL MODELS; ELEMENTARY ASTRONOMY; PHYSICS;
   LANGUAGE; EARTH
AB The development of children's cosmologies was investigated over a
   13-year period, using multimodal, in-depth interviews with 686 children
   ( 217 boys, 227 girls from New Zealand and 129 boys, 113 girls from
   China), aged 2-18. Children were interviewed while they observed the
   apparent motion of the Sun and Moon, and other features of the Earth;
   drew their ideas of the shape and motion of the Earth, Moon and Sun,
   and the causes of daytime and night-time; then modelled them using
   play-dough; which led into discussion of related ideas. These
   interviews revealed that children's cosmologies were far richer than
   previously thought and surprisingly similar in developmental trends
   across the two cultures. There was persuasive evidence of three types
   of conceptual change: a long-term process ( over years) similar to weak
   restructuring; a medium-term process ( over months) akin to radical
   restructuring; and a dynamic form of conceptual crystallisation ( often
   in seconds) whereby previously unconnected/conflicting concepts gel to
   bring new meaning to previously isolated ideas. The interview technique
   enabled the researchers to ascertain children's concepts from
   intuitive, cultural, and scientific levels. The evidence supports the
   argument that children have coherent cosmologies that they actively
   create to make sense of the world rather than fragmented, incoherent
   "knowledge-in-pieces".

AB Broad support exists within the science education community for the
   incorporation of socioscientific issues (SSI) and argumentation in the
   science curriculum. This study investigates how content knowledge and
   morality contribute to the quality of SSI argumentation among high
   school students. We employed a mixed-methods approach: 56 participants
   completed tests of content knowledge and moral reasoning as well as
   interviews, related to SSI topics, which were scored based on a rubric
   for argumentation quality. Multiple regression analyses revealed no
   statistically significant relationships among content knowledge, moral
   reasoning, and argumentation quality. Qualitative analyses of the
   interview transcripts supported the quantitative results in that
   participants very infrequently revealed patterns of content knowledge
   application. However, most of the participants did perceive the SSI as
   moral problems. We propose a "Threshold Model of Knowledge Transfer" to
   account for the relationship between content knowledge and
   argumentation quality. Implications for science education are discussed.

TI Twenty first century science: Insights from the design and
   implementation of a scientific literacy approach in school science
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Although the term "scientific literacy" has been increasingly used in
   recent years to characterise the aim of school science education, there
   is still considerable uncertainty about its meaning and implications
   for the curriculum. A major national project in England, Twenty First
   Century Science, is evaluating the feasibility of a more flexible
   science curriculum structure for 15-year-old and 16-year-old students,
   centring around a core course for all students with a scientific
   literacy emphasis. Over 12,000 students in 78 schools have followed
   this course since September 2003. The development of a detailed
   teaching programme is an important means of clarifying the meanings and
   implications of a "scientific literacy" approach. Questionnaire data
   from teachers at the end of the first and second years of the project
   (N = 40 and N = 51) show a strongly positive evaluation of the central
   features of the course design. Teachers perceive the scientific
   literacy emphasis as markedly increasing student interest and
   engagement. Key challenges identified are the language and reasoning
   demands in looking critically at public accounts of science, and the
   classroom management of more open discussion about science-related
   issues.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID REMINDINGS; MUSEUMS
AB Framed by a "personal constructivist" perspective, this study analyses
   visitors' use of spontaneous memories in understanding different types
   of interactive exhibits, the nature and sources of the retrieved
   memories, and the way that visitors relate an exhibit analogically to
   memories of previous exhibits. One hundred and thirteen visitors
   (either alone or in groups) were observed during their interaction with
   exhibits and interviewed immediately afterwards. The majority of the
   retrieved memories were not used in understanding an exhibit; those
   memories used were mainly semantic and episodic in nature; and exhibits
   were mainly associated with memories by means of a superficial
   similarity between them. Suggestions for enhancing the formation of
   links between visitors' memories and the understanding of an exhibit
   intended by the designer of it are made.

AB Primary teacher preparation courses to need support students in
   developing not only science content knowledge, but also pedagogical
   knowledge appropriate to the effective translation and representation
   of subject matter for learners in classrooms. In the case of the
   generalist primary trainee, this constitutes a considerable challenge.
   This study explored how a group of 13 primary trainees developed
   subject and pedagogical knowledge during university-based training as
   they investigated shadow production in a variety of contexts using
   cognitive conflict as a strategy for promoting conceptual change. By
   using a metacognitive approach, students analysed their own learning in
   response to increasing depth of conflict within a series of shadow
   investigations. The results indicate that the depth of conflict
   perceived by the learners in this study was instrumental in inducing
   conceptual change and generating pedagogical insight within the domain
   of light.

ID LEARNING STYLES; PHYSICS; GENDER; GIRLS
AB While the traditional meaning of connected knowledge is valuable in
   some school subjects, it does not address the main activities of
   knowledge acquisition in subjects such as physics and mathematics. The
   goal of this article is to analyze the relationships between the
   concepts "learning for understanding" and "connected knowledge", a
   central theme in feminist epistemology. In learning for understanding,
   the learner forms multiple, intricate connections among the concepts
   she is studying in school, between school concepts and her everyday
   concepts, and between school concepts and their wider context. Viewing
   connected knowledge as tightly related to understanding has several
   important implications. It brings connected knowledge into the central
   learning activities that take place in school science and mathematics,
   and gives it a high status. It contributes to our understanding of
   gender-related patterns in thinking; and it may form a unifying
   theoretical framework for many studies and projects in the field of
   gender fair education.

ID STUDENTS; MECHANICS; COVARIATION; KNOWLEDGE; REPRESENTATIONS;
   ATTRIBUTION; MODEL
AB College students often experience difficulties in solving physics
   problems. These difficulties largely result from a lack of conceptual
   understanding of the topic. The processes of conceptual learning
   reflect the nature of the causal reasoning process. Two major causal
   reasoning methods are the covariational and the mechanism-based
   approaches. This study was to investigate the effects of different
   causal reasoning methods on facilitating students' conceptual
   understanding of physics. 125 college students from an introduction
   physics class were assigned into covariational group, mechanism-based
   group, and control group. The results show that the mechanism-based
   group significantly outperformed the other two groups in solving
   conceptual problems. However, no significant difference was found in
   all three groups performance on solving computational problems.
   Speculation on the inconsistent performance of the mechanism-based
   group in conceptual and computational problem solving is given.
   Detailed analyses of the results, findings, and educational
   implications are discussed.

ID CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; ISSUES; VALUES
AB The present study draws on environmental science education to explore
   aspects of children's conceptual change regarding hazardous household
   items. Twelve children from a fifth-grade class attended a 30-h
   teaching module of environmentally oriented science activities aimed at
   assessing their awareness about the environmental and health hazards
   posed by several typical household products. In-depth interviews
   before, 2 weeks after, and 1 year after, the teaching intervention
   revealed that children followed three pathways of conceptual change
   ranging from the substantial alterations of their initial ideas to the
   qualitative enrichment of those ideas to the complete rejection of the
   new knowledge. Two components of the instructional intervention - the
   use of living organisms in classroom experiments, and group learning
   activities - along with the development of children's situated
   metacognitive ideas facilitated their learning and increased the
   durability of the acquired knowledge. Additionally, sound indications
   concerning the situated nature and the social construction of the new
   knowledge were observed, as well as that in environmental education
   moral and value issues are closely related to knowledge.

AB In order to study the beliefs of Turkish prospective chemistry teachers
   about teaching chemistry, semi-structured interviews were conducted
   with 12 prospective teachers. Analysis of the interviews revealed that
   most of the prospective teachers held intermediate (transition between
   constructivist and traditional) beliefs about chemistry teaching. Most
   of the student teachers exhibited inconsistencies in their beliefs
   about teaching chemistry. The findings indicate the complexity of the
   teachers' belief systems and imply the significance of identifying
   prospective teachers' beliefs for the design of teacher education

TI Structured collaboration versus individual learning in solving physics
   problems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The research issue in this study is how to structure collaborative
   learning so that it improves solving physics problems more than
   individual learning. Structured collaborative learning has been
   compared with individual learning environments with Schoenfeld's
   problem-solving episodes. Students took a pre-test and a post-test and
   had the opportunity to solve six physics problems. Ninety-nine students
   from a secondary school in Shanghai participated in the study. Students
   who learnt to solve problems in collaboration and students who learnt
   to solve problems individually with hints improved their
   problem-solving skills compared with those who learnt to solve the
   problems individually without hints. However, it was hard to discern an
   extra effect for students working collaboratively with hints - although
   we observed these students working in a more structured way than those
   in the other groups. We discuss ways to further investigate effective
   collaborative processes for solving physics problems.

AB This paper reports a qualitative study on students' informal reasoning
   on a controversial socioscientific issue. Twenty-two students from four
   science classes in Norway were interviewed about the local construction
   of new power lines and the possible increased risk of childhood
   leukaemia. The focus in the study is on what arguments the students
   employ when asked about their decision-making and the interplay between
   knowledge and personal values. Five different types of main arguments
   are identified: the relative risk argument, the precautionary argument,
   the uncertainty argument, the small risk argument, and the pros and
   cons argument. These arguments are presented through case studies, and
   crucial information and values are identified for each argument. The
   students made use of a range of both scientific and non-scientific
   knowledge. The findings are discussed in relation to possible
   consequences for teaching models aimed at increasing students' ability
   to make thoughtful decisions on socio-scientific issues.

   independent inquiry projects

ID CLASSROOM PRACTICE; CONCEPTIONS; KNOWLEDGE; UNDERSTANDINGS; DISCOURSE;
   VIEWS
AB In this study we sought to understand factors that shaped teachers' use
   of student inquiry projects. We examined, over 3 years, the practices
   and conceptions of two teachers involved in implementing student
   inquiry projects. Neither teacher was initially satisfied with her
   success at supporting student inquiry, but the two had very different
   responses to difficulties they faced. These responses related strongly
   to their ideas about how learning should be structured. There was less
   relation between their stated views about the nature of science and
   their use of inquiry than was expected. The teacher with espoused views
   about the nature of science generally in accord with reform documents
   did not support student inquiry projects that involved actual
   investigations. The teacher with views on the nature of science less
   aligned with reform documents worked hard to support student
   investigations in her classroom. Our findings support the claim that
   merely learning about the nature of science or about student inquiry
   may not generate changes in a teacher's practice. On closer analysis,
   we found that the two teachers understood aspects of the nature of
   science from two quite different perspectives, the proximal and the
   distal. The proximal view of the nature of science was more closely
   aligned with implementation of actual student investigations. The
   efforts of these two teachers in implementing inquiry illustrate the
   dilemmas and challenges they faced as they attempted student inquiry
   projects.

ID PERCEPTIONS
AB This paper describes the development of an innovative interprofessional
   doctorate in health and social care, within an academic framework
   designed explicitly to ensure that candidates must demonstrate
   qualities of cognitive application commensurate with doctoral study,
   yet must also meet the practice-focused outcomes of a professional
   doctorate. The degree requires students to attend highly interactive
   workshops in Stage 1 that encourage academic debate and 'doctoral'
   development, in contrast to the 'taught' modular elements of many other
   professional doctorates. Papers submitted during Stage I assume
   increasing levels of complex doctoral skills in developing a research
   proposal that undergoes the same rigorous evaluation required of PhD
   students in securing University Approval. The degree is awarded at the
   end of Stage 2 only after defence of a thesis in a viva voce
   examination that involves procedures and processes defined by the
   University for the award of PhD.

TI Developing an on-line interactive health psychology module
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB On-line teaching material in health psychology was developed which
   ensured a range of students could access appropriate material for their
   course and level of study. This material has been developed around the
   concept of smaller 'content chunks' which can be combined into whole
   units of learning (topics), and ultimately, a module. On the basis of
   the underlying philosophy that the medium is part of the message, we
   considered interactivity to be a key element in engaging the student
   with the material. Consequently, the key aim of this development was to
   stimulate and engage students, promoting better involvement with the
   academic material, and hence better learning. It was hoped that this
   was achieved through the development of material including linked
   programmes and supporting material, small Java Scripts and basic email,
   forms and HTML additions. This material is outlined as are some of the
   interactive activities introduced, and the preliminary student and
   tutor experience described.

TI Developing an entrepreneurial life skills summer school
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Successive governments in the UK have increasingly stressed the need
   for a more enterprising society. Much of the emphasis has been placed
   upon educationalists to introduce more elements of enterprise into the
   school curriculum at all levels, and new and innovative ways to
   initiate the subject matter is increasingly being sought. This article
   describes a summer school that is part of this initiative. It stresses
   the difference between Traditional and Enterprise modes of learning and
   contests that compared with traditional methods of teaching and
   learning, enterprise education requires a different pedagogical
   approach and aims to qualitatively change the educational experience.
   It is suggested that traditional teaching is better suited to the needs
   of the 'old' economy with the enterprising approach being more
   conducive to the needs of the new flexible market economy. While
   providing an explanation, description and analysis of the workings and
   operations of an entrepreneurial life skills summer school, the article
   also provides a systematic and rigorous exploration not only of the
   summer school itself but also of the policy and regional development
   context. It describes how the methodology and approach adopted is
   rooted in the framework and context that shaped and informed the
   venture as well as contributing to the article itself.

TI Development of a thinking programme for engineering students
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The challenge of preparing engineering graduates for a fast-changing
   work environment calls for the development of thinking programmes. A
   psychological basis was used to develop the tenets of the approach. The
   Cognitive Modifiability Intervention (CMI) was rationalized and
   conceived as a corollary of observations of learning scenarios and an
   application of the theory of Structural Cognitive Modifiability (SCM).
   The CMI curriculum encapsulates the following key areas: (1) belief
   system and affective-motivational processes; (2) mediated learning
   experience; (3) cognitive functions; (4) instruments for intervention;
   and (5) bridging for transfer of learning. The CMI included four major
   clusters of cognitive domains, namely the Affective-Motivation Domain
   (ADM), the Systematic-Strategic Thinking (SST) cluster, the
   Analytical-Inferential Thinking (AIT) cluster and the
   Divergent-Creative Thinking (DICT) cluster. It is argued that
   understanding the cognitive needs of engineering students, an approach
   of dealing with the prerequisites of thinking through active
   modification, and coaching skills through staff development are
   essential to the development of a cognitive curriculum for engineering
   education.

TI An evaluation of the training activities provided by videoconferencing

SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents the results of some research that was intended to
   evaluate the use of videoconferencing as a teaching and learning tool
   in the context of doctoral training in medicine at a Canadian
   university hospital centre. The evaluation was conducted by identifying
   the factors that influence the training of students, their satisfaction
   with videoconferencing and their perceived effectiveness of the
   technology as a learning and teaching tool. An appropriate
   questionnaire was developed and administered to students taking a
   videoconferencing-based course for the first time. The results show a
   consistent difference of opinion and attitude between local-site
   students and remote-site students in relation to several aspects of the
   technology-such as the social interactions between instructor and
   students, and the perceived effectiveness of videoconferencing.
   Initially, this difference was attributed to the physical absence of
   the instructor and the use of videoconferencing as such. However,
   students' satisfaction seems to be linked to other factors as well-such
   as the instructor's ability to integrate the technology into his or her
   teaching method.

TI Constructivist teaching and teacher-centred teaching: a comparison of

SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB A case study of an undergraduate Educational Psychology course that
   incorporated both constructivist and teacher-centred teaching was
   conducted. The learning processes and higher-level learning outcomes
   were examined through participant observation, interviews with students
   and analyses of student assignments. The lessons were audio recorded
   and transcribed, and a total of 68 interviews, each about 1.5 hours
   long, were conducted. In general, the constructivist teaching
   facilitated students' creation of their own knowledge, as they were
   allowed to think more over the problems together and generate original
   ideas. Students' performances in recalling, critiquing and generating
   with the knowledge gained in the constructivist teaching context were
   also better than those in the teacher-centred context. This could be
   explained by the deeper processing of the material, the activation of
   students' prior knowledge and the similarity between the situations of
   knowledge construction and knowledge application. The strengths and
   limitations of constructivist teaching are also discussed.

TI Innovating education with an educational modelling language: two case
   studies
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The intent of this study was to investigate how to maximise the chances
   of success of an educational innovation-specifically one based on the
   implementation of the educational modelling language called EML. This
   language is both technically and organisationally demanding. Two
   different implementation cases were investigated, one situated in an
   institution for higher professional education that caters for on-campus
   students; the other in an institution for higher, open distance
   education, that serves off-campus, home-based students.
   Diffusion-innovation theory is used as the backdrop for the analysis.
   It helps us to understand why the implementations failed and what
   measures might be taken to avoid future failure in similar situations.

AB It is often claimed that techniques such as 'multimedia' and the use of
   blended learning environments can be used to achieve powerful
   interactive pedagogies. Indeed, the advent of easy-to-use multimedia
   technologies has meant that a plethora of digital learning products is
   now becoming available. Despite the relative ease-of-use of these new

TI Gironacel (R): a virtual tool for learning quality management
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This article describes the Gironacel (R) project-a virtual learning
   environment produced by the University of Girona. The purpose of this
   tool is to make it easier for students studying quality management
   courses within engineering schools to understand what the 'quality
   culture' is and how to implement the ISO 9001:2000 standard in a very
   practical way. The tool creates a fictitious virtual company, called
   Gironacel (R), that is used as an example. The original aim was to
   provide companies using the tool with all kinds of information
   concerning the challenges that the Gironacel (R) company faces during
   its evolution-and all the difficulties and consequences that come with
   these challenges. In this paper we explain how this new tool was
   designed and implemented. We also outline the nature of the results
   that we expect to gain from its use.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
AB Globalisation has changed the way most people live, work and study in
   the 21st century. Teachers and teacher educators, like other
   professionals, must embrace these changes to be effective in their jobs
   and one ongoing change is the use of Information Communication
   Technologies (ICTs) for lifelong learning. In this paper we describe
   how one group of academics in a university programme preparing new
   teachers has embraced change to introduce innovative programmes using
   ICTs and heutagogy rather than pedagogy. Heutagogy prepares students
   for the self-determined lifelong learning which is essential for
   survival in a 21st century world.

TI The impact of membership of a virtual learning community on individual
   learning careers and professional identity
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT
AB This study takes a relatively new direction in researching virtual
   learning communities (VLCs) as it explores the ways in which VLC
   membership can support lifelong learning and impact on individual
   learning careers and professional identities beyond the life of the
   community. The case study spans 4 years. The findings suggest that
   through the process of engaging in a VLC, individuals may change their
   'horizons of action' leading to new learning and career trajectories.
   In particular, the study demonstrates how membership of a VLC supported
   and enabled some individuals to transform their learning careers and to
   make significant life changes. Other members developed their learning
   careers in an incremental manner that led to increased innovation and
   professional expertise. The findings suggest that VLCs are successful
   in supporting individual change and career development when they
   provide the 'comfort zone' of a secure and supportive virtual
   environment.

TI Joining up the episodes of lifelong learning: A regional transition
   project
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper, we explore the rationale, process and outcomes of the
   Regional Interoperability Project on Progression for Lifelong Learning,
   a project that established a model of cross-sector collaboration in
   personal development planning technology in the UK. With specific
   reference to the widening participation agenda, and grounded in the
   perspective of lifelong learners, the project tested an approach in
   which discrete nodes of an individual's learning journey are joined up
   through technology services. The paper describes the development of
   conceptual and practical tools to assist transitions between various
   communities of learning. A set of scenarios was developed, involving
   study to study and study to employment, while practical tools included
   development of UK LeaP draft interoperability standard
   (BS8788)-compliant links between ePortfolio software, and the actual
   test transfer of data. The results indicate that recognising the
   smallest individual elements in the process is important, both in a
   technical sense and as a means of personalising learning and assisting
   transition between sectors. Through developing connections between
   these elements, the project partners engaged in lifelong learning.

TI The development of a system for supporting the lifelong learner
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID TECHNOLOGY
AB Given the rapidly changing skills needs of 'post-industrial economies',
   lifelong learning forms an integral part of government policy within
   the UK and abroad. However, like the UK, most economies are faced with
   the problem of how to reach those sections of the community that have
   traditionally not embraced learning and educational opportunities. In
   this paper, the development and evaluation of a system designed to
   address this problem is described. The Lifelong Learning in London for
   All (L4All) project has investigated the concept of 'trails' as a way
   of organising lifelong learning opportunities. The L4All pilot system
   combines a set of web services to provide the functionality needed to
   support this central idea. The development process was outlined, and
   the findings of an empirical study were used to confirm proof of
   concept.

TI Knowledge matchmaking in Learning Networks: Alleviating the tutor load
   by mutually connecting Learning Network users
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
AB Tutors have only limited time to support the learning process. In this
   paper, we introduced a model that helps answer the questions of
   students. The model invoked the knowledge and skills of fellow
   students, who jointly formed an ad hoc, transient community. The paper
   situated the model within the context of a Learning Network, a
   self-organised, distributed system, designed to facilitate lifelong
   learning in a particular knowledge domain. We discussed the design of
   the model and explained how we selected and supported capable peers.
   Finally, we examined the calibration of the model and a simulation,
   which was intended to verify if the model is fit for use in experiments
   with students. The results indicate that, indeed, it is possible to
   identify and support capable peers efficiently and effectively.

TI Facilitating interpersonal evaluation of knowledge in a context of
   distributed team collaboration
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID HYPERMEDIA; TOOLS; SELF
AB This study investigates how distributed team members evaluate their own
   and others' knowledge when they engage in goal-directed activities and
   seek shared understanding. Twenty-three manager-level employees of a
   municipal organisation worked as two distributed teams for two months.
   Their work was supported with a visualisation tool, which was embedded
   in the teams' shared www-based workspaces. After the distributed
   working period, the subjects were interviewed and their work in the
   shared workspace was traced. Qualitative analysis of the interviews
   showed that, in distributed collaboration, individuals use both
   self-evaluation and interpersonal evaluation strategies when trying to
   gain an awareness of others' knowledge. The interpersonal evaluations
   included strategies such as assessing the expertise and knowledge of
   others. It is concluded that when individuals do not have situational
   information, eg, what others think about the content of the shared
   task, they tend to make personal attributions. In other words, their
   evaluations of the others' knowledge focus on stable tendencies like
   the expertise of other individuals.

TI Collaborative mentor support in a learning context using a ubiquitous
   discussion forum to facilitate knowledge sharing for lifelong learning
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID TECHNOLOGIES; NETWORK; DESIGN
AB The Internet has recently been identified as a potential enabler of
   lifelong learning. Web-based learning systems enable learners easily to
   access rich resources and actively participate in learning activities
   without time and distance limits. The main challenge in lifelong
   learning is providing the opportunity for discussion and collaborative
   knowledge construction to engage learners in acquiring and applying
   knowledge in the context of learning, working and collaboration.
   Moreover, knowledge sharing is a key component in the formation of
   communities of lifelong learners. Most online collaborative learning
   communities use Web text-based discussion forums for knowledge sharing.
   However, such discussion forums are separated from the context of
   learning activities. Furthermore, the facilitation of beneficial
   dialogue through discussion forums, requires the involvement of mentors
   as facilitators. This study proposes an e-book interface that enables
   learners easily to annotate or enter queries in a text in which
   questions arise, where a query context is transferred to a discussion
   forum. The subsequent anchors of questions are linked to a discussion
   forum for actuating sustained participation. A mentor finder recommends
   a collaborative peer based on learner knowledge level to answer the
   questions. Learners can also use mobile phones to access this
   ubiquitous discussion forum using voice/text anytime and anywhere. The
   experimental results showed a clear increase in the level of
   discussions, and most learners indicated that they benefited
   considerably from collaborative mentor support in an e-book learning
   context through the provision of a ubiquitous discussion forum.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB The paper focuses on the question of how to advance collaboration
   through the Web and support lifelong learning. First, the theoretical
   framework and architecture of a new web-based tool, the 'IQ Team', is
   introduced. IQ Team is an interactive online assessment and support
   system to learn social skills needed in cooperative work, and belongs
   in an interactive online assessing and tutoring system, 'IQ Form',
   developed for the Finnish Virtual University. IQ Team has three main
   elements: (1) interactive self-evaluation test banks, (2) online
   tutoring sets and (3) learning diaries. In the creation of IQ Team, the
   validation process was conducted with two samples (n = 259 and n =
   275). The online students' social skills in different groups were
   explored, and the feedback data from different user groups were
   analysed. The online students scored high values for social skills, and
   no differences were discerned between university, Open University and
   technical students. The qualitative data (n = 35) were collected in
   order to get users' feedback of the tool. The qualitative data
   consisted of interviews, open-ended questions and online discussions.
   The users of IQ Team reflected that the tool benefited them to become
   aware of their group work skills and developed their collaborative
   learning skills. IQ Team provides a powerful tool for online
   instruction and communication in higher education and in the Open
   University to promote joint-regulated learning.

TI Building trust and shared knowledge in communities of e-learning

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
ID INNOVATIVE PROJECTS; PERFORMANCE; TEAMWORK; TEAMS
AB Trust and collective learning are useful features that are enabled by
   effective collaborative leadership of e-learning projects across higher
   and further education (HE/FE) institutions promoting lifelong learning.
   These features contribute effectively to the development of design for
   learning in communities of e-learning practice. For this, reflexivity,
   good leadership and the capacity to engage in innovation is crucial to
   team performance. This paper outlines a serendipitously useful
   combination of innovative models of collaboration emerging from two
   2005-06 UK e-learning pilots: the Joint Information Systems Committee
   (JISC) e-Learning Independent Study Award (eLISA) and JISC infoNet
   Collaborative Approaches to the Management of e-Learning (CAMEL)
   projects. The JISC-funded eLISA Distributed e-Learning (DeL) project
   set up a collaborative partnership among teachers to try out LAMS and
   Moodle using study skills in e-learning. Simultaneously, the JISC
   infoNet CAMEL project developed a model of collaborative approaches to
   e-learning leadership and management across four UK HE/FE institutions.
   This paper proposes two new theoretical collaborative team leadership
   and operational models for e-learning projects, including indices of
   trust, reflexivity and shared procedural knowledge, recommending that
   these models are further developed in future communities of e-learning
   practice in institutions promoting lifelong learning.

AB This paper examines the images middle school students have of science
   and technology, the workplaces, and the relevant professions. It also
   describes the effect on these images caused by an instructional
   initiative, "Investigation into Science and Technology" (IST), designed
   to introduce students to science and technology in the "real life."
   Students' images were delineated via questionnaires, drawing tasks, and
   interviews before and after their participation in the IST program. The
   sample consisted of similar to 100 students from six classes (eighth or
   ninth grade) of three schools. We found that before the IST
   intervention students' images about the scientific or technological
   environments were superficial, unreal, and even incorrect. Their
   impressions of the characteristics of scientists and technologists were
   superficial, misleading, and sometimes reflected ignorance. The
   findings demonstrate that the IST program stimulated a positive effect
   on students' images. Their preconceptions were altered in several
   dimensions: in "the cognitive dimension," from superficial and vague to
   precise and correct images; in "the perceptive dimension," from
   stereotypic to rational and open-minded images; and in "the affective
   dimension," from negative to positive attitudes. (c) 2006 Wiley

AB This study explores how individuals make use of scientific content
   knowledge for socioscientific argumentation. More specifically, this
   mixed-methods study investigates how learners apply genetics content
   knowledge as they justify claims relative to genetic engineering.
   Interviews are conducted with 45 participants, representing three
   distinct groups: high school students with variable genetics knowledge,
   college nonscience majors with little genetics knowledge, and college
   science majors with advanced genetics knowledge. During the interviews,
   participants advance positions concerning three scenarios dealing with
   gene therapy and cloning. Arguments are assessed in terms of the number
   of justifications offered as well as justification quality, based on a
   five-point rubric. Multivariate analysis of variance results indicate
   that college science majors outperformed the other groups in terms of
   justification quality and frequency. Argumentation does not differ
   among nonscience majors or high school students. Follow-up qualitative
   analyses of interview responses suggest that all three groups tend to
   focus on similar, sociomoral themes as they negotiate socially complex,
   genetic engineering issues, but that the science majors frequently
   reference specific science content knowledge in the justification of
   their claims. Results support the Threshold Model of Content Knowledge
   Transfer, which proposes two knowledge thresholds around which
   argumentation quality can reasonably be expected to increase. Research
   and educational implications of these findings are discussed. (c) 2006

ID ELEMENTARY STUDENTS; REFORM
AB A large percentage of U.S. students attending high-poverty urban middle
   schools achieve low levels of science proficiency, posing significant
   challenges to their success in high school science and to national and
   local efforts to reform science education. Through its work in
   Philadelphia schools, the Center for Social Organization of Schools at
   Johns Hopkins University developed a teacher-support model to address
   variation in science curricula, lack of materials, and underprepared
   teachers that combined with initial low levels of proficiency block
   improvements in science achievement. The model includes a common
   science curriculum based on NSF-supported materials commercially
   available, ongoing teacher professional development built around
   day-to-day lessons, and regular in-class support of teachers by expert
   peer coaches. One cohort of students at three Philadelphia middle
   schools using the model was followed from the end of fourth grade
   through seventh grade. Their gains in science achievement and
   achievement levels were substantially greater than students at 3
   matched control schools and the 23 district middle schools serving a
   similar student population. Under school-by-school comparisons, these
   results held for the two schools with adequate implementation. Using
   widely available materials and techniques, the model can be adopted and
   modified by school partners and districts. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals,

TI Learning and teaching as emergent features of informal settings: An

AB Around the world, many people concerned with the state of the
   environment participate in environmental action groups. Much of their
   learning occurs informally, simply by participating in the everyday,
   ongoing collective life of the chosen group. Such settings provide
   unique opportunities for studying how people learn science in complex
   settings without being directly instructed. This study was designed to
   investigate learning and teaching that occurs through ordinary,
   everyday participation in environmental action. We draw on data
   collected during a 2-year ethnographic study of a coast-wide
   eelgrass-mapping project. Taking a whole activity as our unit of
   analysis, we articulate the forms of participation that volunteers take
   and theorize learning in terms of changing participation and expanding
   opportunities for action. The community-based eelgrass stewardship
   group we studied is both socially and materially heterogeneous, made up
   of people young and old and with different expertise. We show that
   changing forms of participation are emergent features of unfolding
   sociomaterial inter-action, not determinate roles or rules.
   Furthermore, the possibilities for learning expand when individuals
   have the opportunity to frame problems that arise in ongoing activity.
   In the setting of our study, attributions (dichotomies) such as
   "off-task/on-task" and "teacher/learner" are artificial. We suggest
   that by providing expanding opportunities, in the form of a variety of
   sociomaterial resources, science educators can rethink the design of
   school-based science learning environments. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals,

TI Using questions sent to an ask-a-scientist site to identify children's

AB Interest is a powerful motivator; nonetheless, science educators often
   lack the necessary information to make use of the power of
   student-specific interests in the reform process of science curricula.
   This study suggests a novel methodology, which might be helpful in
   identifying such interests-using children's self-generated questions as
   an indication of their scientific interests. In this research,
   children's interests were measured by analyzing 1555 science-related
   questions submitted to an international Ask-A-Scientist Internet site.
   The analysis indicated that the popularity of certain topics varies
   with age and gender. Significant differences were found between
   children's spontaneous (intrinsically motivated) and school-related
   (extrinsically motivated) interests. Surprisingly, girls contributed
   most of the questions to the sample; however, the number of American
   girls dropped upon entering senior high school. We also found
   significant differences between girls' and boys' interests, with girls
   generally preferring biological topics. The two genders kept to their
   stereotypic fields of interest, in both their school-related and
   spontaneous questions. Children's science interests, as inferred from
   questions to Web sites, could ultimately inform classroom science
   teaching. This methodology extends the context in which children's
   interests can be investigated. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Visual representations are essential for communicating ideas in the
   science classroom; however, the design of such representations is not
   always beneficial for learners. This paper presents instructional
   design considerations providing empirical evidence and integrating
   theoretical concepts related to cognitive load. Learners have a limited
   working memory, and instructional representations should be designed
   with the goal of reducing unnecessary cognitive load. However,
   cognitive architecture alone is not the only factor to be considered;
   individual differences, especially prior knowledge, are critical in
   determining what impact a visual representation will have on learners'
   cognitive structures and processes. Prior knowledge can determine the
   ease with which learners can perceive and interpret visual
   representations in working memory. Although a long tradition of
   research has compared experts and novices, more research is necessary
   to fully explore the expert-novice continuum and maximize the potential
   of visual representations. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Physics as a subject for school students requires an understanding and
   ability to move between different modes of representation for the
   concepts under review. However, the inability of students to have a
   multimodal understanding of the concepts is seen as restricting their
   understandings of the concepts. The aim of this study was to explore
   the effectiveness of using writing-to-learn strategies that required
   students to embed multimodal representations of the concepts. In
   particular, the study compared a presentation format with a summary
   report format for students learning quantum theory. A pre-post test
   design was used to compare performances of these two groups across two
   units. For unit 1, students' scores from groups that completed either a
   presentation format (PowerPoint presentation) or a summary report
   format (chapter summary) were compared. No limits were placed on the
   amount of text or the number of representations used. For unit 2,
   products of both groups were constructed for an audience of year 10
   students. The presentation format group (PowerPoint) was limited to 15
   slides, with a maximum of 10 words displayed per slide; a script was
   written to accompany the presentation. Slides could include graphical
   and mathematical formulae; however, the text could not. The summary
   report format group that wrote out its explanations was limited to four
   pages and was required to incorporate multimodal representations.
   Results indicated that for both units students using the presentation
   format group scored significantly better on tests than the summary
   report format group. The effect size difference between the groups
   increased for the second unit, indicating that more practice was
   leading to better student understanding of the physics concepts. (c)

AB Given the important role of science teacher educators in developing
   science teachers' understandings of nature of science (NOS), this study
   explores 15 Turkish "prospective" science teacher educators' beliefs
   about NOS in the context of teacher education reform in Turkey. A
   reflection-oriented qualitative approach was adopted in the
   investigation. Data were collected through two sets of interviews with
   the participants and analyzed by means of cognitive maps. The analysis
   of data revealed that most of the participants of the study had
   inadequate conceptions regarding NOS. The majority of these inadequate
   conceptions were concentrated under two aspects of NOS: scientific
   method and the tentative NOS. The participants' inadequate conceptions
   appeared to be linked to a lack of prior reflection about NOS. The
   study has implications for the preservice preparation of science
   teacher educators, teacher education reform, and teacher thinking at
   both the practical and the policy levels. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals,

   CONCEPTIONS
AB At the start of their first semester, 35 college freshmen were given an
   interview probing (a) their differentiation of scientists' ideas from
   evidence, and hypotheses from theories; (b) their understanding of the
   inherent uncertainty of scientific knowledge; and (c) their reasoning
   about scientific controversies. The most common responses were in terms
   of an epistemology in which scientists' ideas and evidence are
   differentiated, and theories are understood as tested hypotheses (Level
   2 in our system based on Carey, Evans, Honda, Jay, & Unger, 1989),
   although students varied in how consistently they differentiated
   theories and evidence across all questions. Responses in which theories
   are understood as broader explanatory frameworks guiding hypothesis
   testing (Level 3) were virtually nonexistent, but some students gave
   responses that showed awareness of processes of interpreting and
   reinterpreting patterns of results (Level 2.5). Responses across the
   three parts of the interview were significantly related. Consistently
   differentiating scientists' ideas from evidence was strongly related to
   appreciating the inherent uncertainty of scientific knowledge and with
   having a deeper understanding of the reasons for scientific
   controversies and how to resolve them. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB A composite theory of college science student note-taking strategies
   was derived from a periodic series of five interviews with 23 students
   and with other variables, including original and final versions of
   notes analyzed during a semester-long genetics course. This evolving
   composite theory was later compared with Van Meter, Yokoi, and
   Pressley's (Journal of Educational Psychology, 86, 323-338, 1994)
   corresponding composite "college students' theory of note-taking."
   Students' notes in this long-term study were also compared with a
   standard of "adequate" note-taking established by experts. Analyses
   detected many similarities between the two composite theories. Analyses
   also provided evidence of inadequate note-taking strategies,
   inconsistencies between what students claimed and evidently did with
   their notes,. and weak self-regulating learning strategies.
   Recommendations included prompting students during class on how to take
   notes. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID CLASSROOM; TEACHERS
AB In classrooms from kindergarten to graduate school, researchers have
   identified target students as students who monopolize material and
   human resources. Classroom structures that privilege the voice and
   actions of target students can cause divisive social dynamics that may
   generate cliques. This study focuses on the emergence of target
   students, the formation of cliques, and professors' efforts to mediate
   teacher learning in a Master of Science in Chemistry Education (MSCE)
   program by structuring the classroom environment to enhance nontarget
   students' agency. Specifically, we sought to answer the following
   question: What strategies could help college science professors enact
   more equitable teaching structures in their classrooms so that target
   students and cliques become less of an issue in classroom interactions?
   The implications for professional education programs in science and
   mathematics include the need for professors to consider the role and
   contribution of target students to the learning environment, the need
   to structure an equitable learning environment, and the need to foster
   critical reflection upon classroom interactions between students and
   instructors. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Self-definition of women experiencing a nontraditional graduate

SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING
LA English
DT Article
ID STUDENTS; GENDER
AB Women continue to be underrepresented in the fields of science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). One factor
   contributing to this underrepresentation is the graduate school
   experience. Graduate programs in STEM fields are constructed around
   assumptions that ignore the reality of women's lives; however, emerging
   opportunities may lead to experiences that are more compatible for
   women. One such opportunity is the Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12
   Education (GK-12) Program, which was introduced by the National Science
   Foundation in 1999. Although this nontraditional graduate program was
   not designed explicitly for women, it provided an unprecedented context
   in which to research how changing some of the basic assumptions upon
   which a graduate school operates may impact women in science. This
   exploratory case study examines the self-definition of 8 women graduate
   students who participated in a GK-12 program at a major research
   university. The findings from this case study contribute to higher
   education's understanding of the terrain women graduate students in the
   STEM areas must navigate as they participate in programs that are
   thought to be more conducive to their modes of self-definition while
   they continue to seek to be successful in the historically Eurocentric,
   masculine STEM fields. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Based on the new technology initiative in Syrian education, this study
   explored the attitudes of high school English as a Foreign Language
   (EFL) teachers in Syria toward ICT. In addition, the study investigated
   the relationship between computer attitudes and five independent
   variables: computer attributes, cultural perceptions, computer
   competence, computer access, and personal characteristics (including
   computer training background). The findings suggest that teachers have
   positive attitudes toward ICT in education. Teachers' attitudes were
   predicted by computer attributes, cultural perceptions and computer
   competence. The results point to the importance of teachers' vision of
   technology itself, their experiences with it, and the cultural
   conditions that surround its introduction into schools in shaping their
   attitudes toward technology and its subsequent diffusion in their
   educational practice. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   of business content issues through cooperative learning. Two groups of
   female students at a Japanese university studying either tourism or Web
   page design were assigned tasks that required cooperation to
   investigate whether a minimum of formal training and interaction
   between the two groups would result in an increase in the "design"
   students' awareness of content issues in page design, and an
   improvement in the "tourism" students' ability to evaluate Web pages
   related to tourism. The results showed only slight improvements,
   suggesting that either the amount of cooperative learning must be

AB Simulation output analysis has received little attention comparing to
   modeling and programming in realworld simulation applications. This is
   further evidenced by our observation that students and beginners
   acquire neither adequate details of knowledge nor relevant experience
   of simulation output analysis in traditional classroom learning. With
   the advances in the Internet learning environment, web-based
   computer-based training (CBT) can efficiently and effectively enhance
   the traditional classroom learning. This research addresses the issue
   of designing a web-based CBT course to assist the classroom instruction
   in helping students learn better simulation problem solving. The goal
   is to provide an effective way to learn the implicit experience of
   simulation output analysis via an efficient interactive environment. A
   prototype asynchronous web CBT system with simulation analysis
   guidelines was built to verify our design through a three-stage
   formative usability evaluation. The results showed that the simulation
   analysis guidelines organized by this research significantly improved
   the test scores and the interactive CBT system maintained students'
   interests longer than the written format. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB This study investigates the quality and nature of virtual interaction
   in a higher education context. The study aims to find out variables
   that mediate virtual interaction, particularly the emerging processes
   of sharing and constructing perspectives in web-based conferencing. The
   purpose of this paper is to report the results on different levels of
   web-based discussions with parallel findings on the amount of sharing
   perspectives. The findings of two empirical studies are compared, and
   thereby also the impact of the pedagogical model designed between these
   two studies is evaluated. Possible explanations for why some
   discussions reach higher levels and include more perspective sharing
   than others are also searched for. Particular attention is paid to the
   qualitatively distinct ways in which individual students interpret
   their participation in virtual interaction and the impact of group
   working on their own learning. These findings lead us on to discuss
   specific processes by which participants could better understand each
   other, create joint goals and construct meanings in virtual
   interaction. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE intelligent tutoring systems; applications in subject areas;

AB Statistical quality control - SQC (consisting of Statistical Process
   Control, Process Capability Studies, Acceptance Sampling and Design of
   Experiments) is a very important tool to obtain, maintain and improve
   the Quality level of goods and services produced by an organization.
   Despite its importance, and the fact that it is taught in technical and
   college courses, as well as in companies' training sectors, SQC has
   been largely misused. An inappropriate teaching approach may be the
   cause of such problem; therefore it has motivated the development of a
   model for SQC teaching, allowing its learners to correctly apply SQC
   techniques. After a survey regarding the concept needed to correctly
   apply SQC, its use and teaching/training methods, the model's contents
   and methodology were defined. We also realized the opportunity of
   incorporating a computer environment for the model, permitting the
   practice of the needed SQC concepts and skills. An Artificial
   Intelligence approach was used to develop the computer environment,
   resulting in an Intelligent Tutoring System, the STCEQ. The paper
   discusses the main characteristics of the system, its functioning,
   benefits of using such a system and the results we obtained while using
   this system. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB These longitudinal studies investigated the cultural mediation of
   children's thinking about the Earth using an interview technique
   designed to elicit responses from children from all "levels" of their
   conceptual organization ( intuitive, cultural, and scientific). Close
   scrutiny of the research literature in this field reveals that some
   strategies used in the past to probe children's ideas have been
   influenced by the background of the interviewer, either in the design
   of their questions or in the use made of concrete props ( e. g., of the
   Earth's shape). This has tended to obscure the degree of cultural
   influence in those interviewed. Central to the current research was the
   development of an interview method ("instrument attunement") that was
   flexible, culturally adaptable, and could be tuned to the response
   level of the child. The participants included 129 boys and 113 girls
   from China, and 217 boys and 227 girls from New Zealand. The
   methodology utilizing observational astronomy led into discussion of
   the motion and shape of the Earth, Sun and Moon. Surprisingly, the
   development of children's concepts was found to be remarkably similar
   within the three main ethnic groups (Han, New Zealand European and New
   Zealand Maori) in the two cultures ( China and New Zealand). Cases of
   cultural mediation were detected using the new methodology but these
   could be assimilated into a common taxonomy of cosmological concepts
   for all participants.

AB The aim of this research is to ascertain teachers' opinions on what
   elements of nature of science (NOS) and science-technology-society
   relationships (STS) should be taught in school science. To this end an
   adapted version of the questionnaire developed by Osborne et al. is
   used. Our results show that experts consulted by Osborne et al. and
   Spanish teachers confer similar importance on the provisional,
   experimental, and predictive nature of scientific knowledge based on
   some of the procedures used such as the drawing up of hypotheses and
   the analysis and interpretation of data. We also look into the
   relationship between the teachers' views and their educational
   background. 1 Results suggest that philosophy teachers are more
   concerned with the inclusion of NOS and STS topics in science curricula
   than science teachers, although further studies will be necessary. Some
   suggestions concerning the university training of science teachers are
   also discussed.

   ACHIEVEMENT; CITIZENSHIP; TECHNOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE; IMPACT
AB This paper explores the science-related interests and out-of-school
   experiences of 583 ninth-grade Greek students. The instrument of data
   collection consisted of a questionnaire including items on
   science-related topics that could be of interest to students and on
   everyday, out-of-school, science-related experiences. Factor analysis
   yielded six distinct fields of interest and five types of
   science-related experiences. Significant gender differences emerge:
   girls are more interested in topics related to human biology, health,
   and fitness, and are more familiar with using instruments and devices,
   seeking information about nature, and doing cuisine and handicraft;
   while boys are more interested in science, technology, and their social
   dimension, and the threatening aspects of science and technology, and
   tend to engage more in manual work and computer use. The results of
   this study indicate that there is a need for the Greek science
   curriculum to become more appealing to students, by integrating topics
   and experiences that are interesting and relevant to them.

TI Towards a theoretical framework for teaching controversial

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE; CURRICULUM; DEFENSIBILITY; ATTITUDES
AB This paper develops a conceptual basis for a model on the teaching of
   socio-scientific controversial issues for secondary or high school
   students. I argue that the teaching of controversial issues needs a
   stronger theoretical base. Drawing on a liberal democratic conception
   of possible sources of conflict, three strands are developed that
   provide a framework for teachers when teaching socio-scientific issues:
   these are categories of reasonable disagreement, the communicative
   virtues, and modes of thought. Examples are given to illustrate how the
   framework can be used by teachers in which the features of controversy
   are made explicit to students.

TI Australian undergraduate biotechnology student attitudes towards the
   teaching of ethics
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID BIOETHICS; BIOLOGY; PERCEPTIONS; EDUCATION
AB In recent years, ethics has become part of most tertiary biotechnology
   curricula. There is, however, considerable variation in the extent and
   manner of ethics education provided to students in different
   institutions. In addition, the perceived need that students and
   employers have regarding ethics education, and the aims and expected
   outcomes of ethics education, are rarely made clear. This research
   reports the findings of a questionnaire administered to 375
   undergraduate biotechnology students from 19 Australian universities to
   determine their attitudes towards the teaching of ethics. The results
   suggest that undergraduate biotechnology students generally regard
   ethics education to be important and that ethics should be included in
   undergraduate biotechnology curricula. Students tended, however, to
   emphasize the professional and industrial side of ethics and not to
   recognize the personal effects of morals and behaviour. We provide
   suggestions for rethinking how ethics should be taught.

ID SCIENCE-EDUCATION; MEDIA REPORTS; PRESS; NEWS
AB The ability to understand and evaluate news reporting of science is
   often cited as an attribute of a scientifically literate person. This
   work reports on an attempt to develop such attributes in a group of 19
   student-teachers. They were introduced to a review technique designed
   to help them evaluate newspaper representation of science and engage
   more effectively in a course dealing with biotechnology and associated
   socio-scientific issues. The work they produced was examined for a
   range of evidence, and this showed that they were able to comment
   effectively on issues such as the newsworthiness of stories, bias in
   reporting, and the portrayal of science and scientists. Questionnaire
   responses indicated that the technique helped them to think about the
   media reporting of science in ways that were new to them. They believed
   school-age students would benefit from a similar technique, and its use
   in schools is seen as highly desirable.

TI Discussion of socio-scientific issues: The role of science knowledge
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID DECISION-MAKING; CURRICULUM; MEIOSIS; CELLS
AB This paper considers the relationship between science knowledge and the
   ability to engage in reasoned discussion of the social consequences of
   science. Through a study of over 200 school students aged 14-16 we show
   that the ability to engage in reasoned discussion of applications of
   gene technology is strongly influenced by the ability to recognize key
   issues, and that ability to recognize key issues requires some
   understanding of the relevant science. It is also influenced by the
   specificity of the context under discussion and personal experience.
   The requisite scientific knowledge base is relatively modest and can be
   effectively taught through brief teaching interventions that are well
   designed and contextualized.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate how sixth graders develop
   inquiry skills to construct explanations in an inquiry-based learning
   environment. We designed a series of inquiry-based learning activities
   and identified four inquiry skills that are relevant to students'
   construction of explanation. These skills include skills to identify
   causal relationships, to describe the reasoning process, to use data as
   evidence, and to evaluate explanations. Multiple sources of data (e.g.,
   video recordings of learning activities, interviews, students'
   artifacts, and pre/post tests) were collected from two science classes
   with 58 sixth graders. The statistical results show that overall the
   students' inquiry skills were significantly improved after they
   participated in the series of the learning activities. Yet the level of
   competency in these skills varied. While students made significant
   progress in identifying causal relationships, describing the reasoning
   process, and using data as evidence, they showed slight improvement in
   evaluating explanations. Additionally, the analyses suggest that phases
   of inquiry provide different kinds of learning opportunities and
   interact with students' development of inquiry skills.

TI Classroom interaction in science: Teacher questioning and feedback to
   students' responses
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID COGNITIVE CONFLICT; WAIT TIME; DISCOURSE
AB The purpose of this study was to (a) develop an analytical framework
   that represents classroom talk and questioning in science, (b) find out
   how teachers use questioning to engage their students in thinking about
   conceptual content that enables the construction of knowledge, and (c)
   identify the various forms of feedback provided by teachers in the
   follow-up move of the initiation response-follow-up format of teaching
   exchange. Several lessons from Year 7 classes were observed across a
   variety of lesson structures such as expository teaching, whole-class
   discussions, laboratory demonstration, and hands-on practical work. The
   lessons were audiotaped and videotaped. Transcripts of the lessons were
   made and analysed, with particular attention paid to interactions that
   involved questions. Using the "Questioning-based Discourse" analytical
   framework developed in this study, four different types of feedback
   were identified. Interactional issues related to ways of speaking and
   questioning that encourage student responses and thinking are
   addressed. This information provides a description of what constitutes
   effective discourse in science teaching and learning, and will also be
   useful for both teachers and teacher-educators in identifying an
   appropriate repertoire of skills for subsequent teacher education and
   professional development.

ID SCIENCE
AB This study investigated the possible activation of different types of
   model-based reasoning processes in two learning settings, and the
   influence of various terms of reasoning on the learners' problem
   representation development. Changes in 53 students' problem
   representations about genetic issue were analysed while they worked
   with different modelling tools in a synchronous network-based
   environment. The discussion log-files were used for the "microgenetic"
   analysis of reasoning types. For studying the stages of students'
   problem representation development, individual pre-essays and
   post-essays and their utterances during two reasoning phases were used.
   An approach for mapping problem representations was developed.
   Characterizing the elements of mental models and their reasoning level
   enabled the description of five hierarchical categories of problem
   representations. Learning in exploratory and experimental settings was
   registered as the shift towards more complex stages of problem
   representations in genetics. The effect of different types of reasoning
   could be observed as the divergent development of problem
   representations within hierarchical categories.

AB This paper examines the evidence for the digital divide based on
   gender. An overview of research published in the last 20 years draws to
   the conclusion that females are at a disadvantage relative to men when
   learning about computers or learning other material with the aid of
   computer-assisted software. The evidence shows that the digital divide
   affects people of all ages and across international boundaries. We
   suggest that the digital divide is fundamentally a problem of computer
   anxiety whose roots are deep in socialization patterns of boys and
   girls and that interact with the stereotype of computers as toys for
   boys. A model of the digital divide is presented that examines gender
   stereotypes, attribution patterns, and stereotype threat as antecedents
   of computer anxiety. Computer anxiety in turn leads to differences in
   computer attitudes and computer performance. A number of suggestions
   are offered to reduce the impact of the digital divide.

AB Gender differences in the pursuit of technology careers are a current
   issue of concern. We report on two studies that use surveys, drawings
   and interviews to examine sixth- and eighth-grade students' perceptions
   of knowledgeable computer users and their self-perception as a
   computer-type person. In Study 1, participants were asked to generate
   representations of computer users in pictures or words. The results
   indicate that the majority of representations were of male users and
   they frequently wore glasses. Students of both genders were more likely
   to draw males. Eighth-grade students' representations included more
   stereotypical features than those of sixth-grade students. In Study 2,
   students were asked whether they believed that there was such a thing
   as a computer-type person and whether they perceived themselves to be
   one. Eighty per cent of students rejected this characterization. They
   differed from students who accepted it in their levels of past
   experience, their confidence, and the probability that they shared
   their knowledge with others. The results of both studies suggest that
   while there is a male image of computer science in general, it is not
   overly negative and students' self-perception is not governed by their
   own gender as much as by other variables.

AB This paper considers gender differences in online contexts and examines
   current trends in women's performance, access and experience of online
   courses. It uses supportive case study examples and specific research
   into students' academic engagement, conceptions and perceptions of
   learning support in online environments. The analysis shows that women
   studying online are confident independent learners who may outperform
   their male counterparts. They do not have reduced computer and Internet
   access compared with men, nor are they disinclined to enrol on online
   courses. They attach greater value to the pastoral aspect of tutoring
   and have different interaction styles from men, which may have
   implications for online tutoring support. The gender debate needs to
   move on from access and performance to the differences and similarities
   in the degree of importance that men and women place on different
   interaction and tutoring styles online.

AB This study aimed to examine gender and status effects in the kind of
   e-mails used to manage course administrative issues in an educational
   setting. Students were asked to respond to an e-mail presented as being
   from a member of staff, informing them of failure to submit coursework
   and asking for an explanation to be provided. The sex and status of the
   sender were varied. The data showed both gender and status effects. The
   men more frequently adopted an assertive stance, while the women more
   frequently referred to work-related issues in a conciliatory way. A
   number of features of the e-mails varied according to the sex of the
   participant, and the status and sex of the sender. There was evidence
   of a greater influence of status in features of the replies from the
   men, although the effect of this varied according to the sex of the
   sender. In addition, accommodation to the gender-stereotypes of the
   senders was evident in features of the data from both men and women.

AB This paper discusses findings from an extensive project examining
   gender, language and computer-mediated communication (CMC) in the
   context of undergraduate psychology courses. The contributions of 197
   introductory psychology students (148 females, 49 males) participating
   in asynchronous CMC as part of their course were collated and coded for
   their language content using a qualitative content analysis procedure
   in Atlas.ti 4.2. Nearly 700 postings were characterised according to
   gender on the basis of seven categories relating to language and
   communication style - attenuated, authoritative, traditional male and
   female language features, mixed language, positive socioemotional and
   negative socioemotional. Gender interactions were analysed in terms of
   positive and negative socioemotional content, focusing on explicit
   markers of agreement and disagreement. Gender-related patterns in
   language use and interaction style were found. Females were more likely
   than males to make attenuated contributions and express agreement,
   whereas males were more likely than females to make authoritative
   contributions and express disagreement. These results are discussed in
   terms of the implications for the increasing use of CMC in education.

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE boys' attainment in literacy; phonological awareness; talking books
AB Framed by current concerns about boys' attainment in literacy, this
   paper investigates the potential of talking books software to support
   the literacy development of male beginning readers. The study primarily
   considered whether typically developing boys who showed lower levels of
   attainment in phonological awareness would show a greater degree of
   improvement in phonological awareness or a change in reading strategy,
   following a talking books intervention, than boys who were
   demonstrating higher levels of phonological awareness. It also examined
   whether the boys' phonological awareness attainment would affect how
   they used the software to support their attempts at reading, both in
   terms of their interactions with the computer and the types of speech
   feedback that they selected. The analysis also considered whether there
   was any association between the nature of the boys' teaching and
   learning interactions with the computer and any changes in their
   reading strategies from pre- to post-test. The findings suggest that
   the use of the talking books software was particularly beneficial for
   boys who initially showed lower phonological proficiency, and that the
   boys in this study utilised the talking books software adaptively
   depending on their phonological proficiency. Moreover, there was
   evidence that contact with the talking books affected the reading
   strategies of the boys who had higher phonological awareness. There was
   also evidence of an association between the way in which the boys
   interacted with the software and changes in their reading strategy
   between pre- and post-test.

AB One important factor related to ill-structured problem-solving success
   is intrinsic motivation, that is, students' willingness to persist in
   solving the problem. Goal orientation, a motivational variable,
   explains reasons why students engage in the activity because they want
   to either learn or perform. This study investigated the relation-ship
   between these two types of goal orientations and their effects on
   motivation and problem solving by varying three instructional contexts
   designed to promote one of the two orientations. Heterogeneous and
   homogeneous peer grouping based on self-efficacy was also predicted to
   affect intrinsic motivation and problem solving. The results indicated
   that students in the learning-oriented context had significantly higher
   intrinsic motivation than those in the performance-oriented context.
   Students in the heterogeneous peer group had higher scores on
   monitoring and evaluating problem-solving subskills than those in the
   homogeneous peer groups. Learning-goal orientation and solution
   development were significantly related when students participated in
   the learning-oriented, heterogeneous peer grouping treatment group..

AB Few evidence-based instructional practices achieve large-scale use,
   often remaining only in the schools directly involved in their
   development. Research on scaling up effective educational practice
   often lacks sensitive measures of the practice's implementation and the
   required research protocol. This article describes how we used rate of
   implementation as a sensitive measure to help identify barriers to
   implementation Of class-wide peer tutoring (CWPT). Using communication
   technologies and a learning management system, we monitored the rate of
   CWPT implementation and its research protocol across nine schools in
   five states. Rate of implementation was defined as the number of weeks
   in which a school successfully completed the 12 implementation tasks
   required to reach full implementation. We discuss factors related to
   the variation in implementation rate (30-50 weeks) between schools, and
   implications of this measurement strategy for research on instructional
   practices and the technology used to facilitate scalability research.

AB The rapid acceleration of online course offerings presents a design
   challenge for instructors who want to take materials developed for
   face-to-face settings and adapt them for asynchronous online usage.
   Broadcast lectures are relatively easy to transfer, but adapting
   content is harder when classes use small-group discussions, as in
   role-playing or negotiation games. To be successful, such environments
   should address three interrelated design challenges: (a) sustaining
   engagement, (b) promoting content-focused discussion, and (c) promoting
   reflection-on-action. This article is a case study of how one
   interactive role-playing game, Island Telecom, was adapted for online
   play. We describe eight design features, including automated player
   roles and a structured team decision-making process, and show how they
   match with design challenges. Feedback from a recent run of this game
   shows that, although students still prefer to play face-to-face, they
   now also give favorable ratings to the online version. Feedback on
   specific adaptations is also presented.

DE blended learning; hypertext; authoring tool; university; forestry
AB At the Institute of Silviculture at the University of Natural Resources
   and Applied Life Sciences, Vienna, students learn to cross-link
   ecological, socio-economic and technical knowledge of maintaining,
   regenerating, tending and utilizing forests in a sustainable way. They
   learn complex concepts and processes most successfully when they are
   actively engaged in the learning process. Therefore, the principle of
   blended learning, a combination of online phases and face-to-face
   meetings is proposed. In this contribution, a brief description on the
   didactic concept of the courses in Silviculture, the features of the
   content management system COCOON, the authoring tool, the process of
   teaching and the way how students are supported by the integration of
   different learning objects is given. Rationale, challenges and pitfalls
   of the approach are discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This paper explores the impact of a school management information
   system on the interrelations between parents and school and parents and
   their student children in terms of the children's learning, behavior
   and attendance (LBA), during one academic year, in a vocational high
   school, located in a mainstream socio-economic neighborhood. Parents'
   LBA interrelations with the principal, homeroom teachers, grade level
   coordinators, and the school as an institution as well as with their
   children changed noticeably. The involvement of parents in general, but
   of parents with children having LBA problems in particular, in school
   LBA issues became more intensive, more frequent and more focused. The
   paper's results add the information technology dimension to parents
   involvement in school research, a dimension neglected so far.
   Implications for the principal's work are discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier

AB In recent years, research efforts on complex systems have contributed
   to improve our ability in investigating, at different levels of
   complexity, the emergent behaviour showed by system in the course of
   its evolution. The study of emergence, an intrinsic property of a large
   number of complex systems, can be tackled by making use of Cellular
   Automata (CA): these enable researchers to identify the emergent
   dynamics of a complex system, whose behaviour is determined by local
   rules that define the way in which the elementary parts interact with
   each other. This work presents the results of an experimentation aimed
   to investigate the efficacy of a methodology which uses the simulation
   and CA in the learning of emergence. As results, the 93% of the
   students that which took parts to the experimentation is able to
   recognize characteristics of complex system. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Studies have shown that videoconferencing is an effective medium for
   facilitating communication between parties who are separated by
   distance, particularly when learners are engaged in complex
   collaborative learning tasks. However, as in face-to-face
   communication, learners benefit most when they receive additional
   support for such learning tasks. This article provides an overview of
   three empirical studies to illustrate more general insights about how
   to support collaborative learning with videoconferencing. The focus is
   on conceptual support, such as structural visualization and
   socio-cognitive support, such as scripts. Based on the results of the
   three studies, conclusions can be drawn about the conceptual and
   socio-cognitive support measures that promote learning. Conclusions can
   also be reached about the need for employing both conceptual and
   socio-cognitive support to provide learners with the most benefit. (c)

ID INDEPENDENCE; EDUCATION
AB Using an academic library has always been a crucial part of studying in
   higher education, but this has presented problems for independent
   learners taking distance education courses. In the past, Open
   University (UKOU) students were provided with almost everything needed
   to successfully complete any course. Nowadays, growth in Internet use
   enables learners to go 'outside the box' to locate resources that might
   be relevant for their studies. Although such resources are increasingly
   being included as components of UKOU courses, the extent to which
   students use them varies enormously between courses. Data from a
   large-scale survey is examined and a number of explanatory factors are
   considered in an attempt to account for this variability. It is argued
   that students' use of on-line 'external' resources is closely related
   to the pedagogic design of courses and to assessment requirements, not
   merely to the increased availability of information sources on the
   World Wide Web. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Analyzing collaborative interactions: divergence, shared understanding
   and construction of knowledge
SO COMPUTERS & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE CSCL; shared understanding; divergence; collaborative interactions
AB One of the most important facets of collaborative learning is the
   interaction between individual and collaborative learning activities -
   between divergent perspectives and shared knowledge building.
   Individuals bring divergent ideas into a collaborative environment.
   While individuals bring their own unique knowledge and perspectives,
   the second important aspect of collaborative learning is how they move
   from seemingly divergent perspectives to collaborative knowledge
   building. This is clearly a social process among group members who
   could adopt various strategies for resolving differences including
   asserting dominance, acquiescing, or some form of reciprocal sense
   making. An important aspect of collaborative learning is the move from
   assimilation to construction, i.e., creating new understandings based
   on the discussions that they have had. Documenting this change from
   divergence to collaborative knowledge building to possible construction
   is therefore important in understanding the nature the collaborative
   interactions. In this paper we discuss our analysis of the process of
   collaborative interactions based on three dimensions - divergence of
   ideas, collaborative knowledge building and construction. Our aim was
   to document as well as to understand how collaborative interactions
   develop over time: whether students raise new issues (ideas) more
   frequently as they become more familiar with the discussion and
   discussants, and whether shared knowledge building becomes richer over
   time, and subsequent evidence that students were able to construct
   their own understanding based on their interactions with others. Our
   analyses were conducted in the context of an online graduate course
   conducted using the learning environment that we designed, CoDE,
   (Constructivist, Distributed learning Environment). In this paper, we
   will first describe the design of CoDE. We will then describe a study
   in which CoDE was used to offer an online graduate course in learning
   theories. We then discuss our analyses of both individual and
   collaborative learning as it progressed through the duration of the
   course. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we present the findings of a study of attitude changes
   of entry-level University students towards computers conducted at two
   South African Universities. Analysis comprised t tests to discover
   differences between the perceptions/attitudes of male and female
   respondents, English/Afrikaans speakers and those speaking the other
   indigenous languages, respondents who received some form of computer
   education and those that did not, between distance education and
   residential students as well as between those that attended Computer
   Studies at school with no other form of computer education and those
   that did not. We also compared our results to those of a similar study
   conducted at the University of Natal, South Africa in 1997. The results
   showed that there is a greater appreciation of the benefit of
   computers, less fear of computer power, a more realistic view of
   computers and also a lesser impression of computer power. The
   conclusion is reached that less time should be spent in the syllabi on
   convincing students as to the benefits of computing machinery, as well
   as allaying fears about computing power. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB This study examines elementary students' abilities to conduct science
   inquiry through their participation in an instructional intervention
   over a school year. The study involved 25 third and fourth grade
   students from six elementary schools representing diverse linguistic
   and cultural groups. Prior to and at the completion of the
   intervention, the students participated in elicitation sessions as they
   conducted a semistructured inquiry task on evaporation. The results
   indicate that students demonstrated enhanced abilities with some
   aspects of the inquiry task, but continued to have difficulties with
   other aspects of the task even after instruction. Although students
   from all demographic subgroups showed substantial gains, students from
   non-mainstream and less privileged backgrounds in science showed
   greater gains in inquiry abilities than their more privileged
   counterparts. The results contribute to the emerging literature on
   designing learning environments that foster science inquiry of
   elementary students from diverse backgrounds. (c) 2006 Wiley

ID EDUCATION; CULTURE; SCHOOL
AB It has been widely proposed that student voices should play a crucial
   role in designing and implementing curriculum and instruction that
   promote students' engagement in science learning. In this study we
   examined the voices of two seventh grade boys from a low-income urban
   community as they worked together in an after-school program to create
   a student-directed video documentary about science. Our analysis showed
   that these students used their voices to construct identities that they
   cared about in school, by reconstructing some aspects of their school
   identity that did not match who they aspired to be, as well as by
   gaining new resources to enact their desired identities. The examples
   provided demonstrate that integrating student voice in a science
   project can make participation in science a valuable tool in students'
   identity formation. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID INQUIRY; EDUCATION; SETTINGS
AB This article reports on a 21/2-year collaborate project to reform the
   teaching and learning of science in the context of Mae Jemison
   Elementary, the lowest performing elementary school in the state of
   Louisiana. I outline a taxonomy of authentic science inquiry
   experiences and then use the resulting framework to focus on how
   project participants interpreted and enacted ideas about collaboration
   and authenticity. The resulting contextually authentic science inquiry
   model links the strengths of a canonically authentic model of science
   inquiry (grounded in the Western scientific canon) with the strengths
   of a youth-centered model of authenticity (grounded in
   student-generated inquiry), thus bringing together relevant content
   standards and topics with critical social relevance. I address the
   question of how such enactments may or may not promote doing science
   together and consider the implications of this model for urban science
   education. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   EDUCATION REFORM; INSTRUCTION; PEDAGOGY; DIFFERENCE; KNOWLEDGE;
   STUDENTS; EQUITY
AB What teaching practices foster inquiry and promote students to learn
   challenging subject matter in urban schools? Inquiry-based instruction
   and successful inquiry learning and teaching in project-based science
   (PBS) were described in previous studies (Brown & Campione, 1990;
   Crawford, 1999; Krajcik, Blumenfeld, Marx, Bass, & Fredricks, 1998;
   Krajcik, Blumenfeld, Marx, & Solloway, 1994; Minstrell & van Zee,
   2000). In this article, we describe the characteristics of inquiry
   teaching practices that promote student learning in urban schools.
   Teaching is a major factor that affects both achievement of and
   attitude of students toward science (Tamir, 1998). Our involvement in
   reform in a large urban district includes the development of suitable
   learning materials and providing continuous and practiced-based
   professional development (Fishman & Davis, in press; van Es, Reiser,
   Matese, & Gomez, 2002). Urban schools face particular challenges when
   enacting inquiry-based teaching practices like those espoused in PBS.
   In this article, we describe two case studies of urban teachers whose
   students achieved high gains on pre- and posuests and who demonstrated
   a great deal of preparedness and commitment to their students.
   Teachers' attempts to help their students to perform well are described
   and analyzed. The teachers we discuss work in a school district that
   strives to bring about reform in mathematics and science through
   systemic reform. The Center for Learning Technologies in Urban Schools
   (LeTUS) collaborates with the Detroit Public Schools to bring about
   reform in middle-school science. Through this collaboration, diverse
   populations of urban-school students learn science through
   inquiry-oriented projects and the use of various educational learning
   technologies. For inquiry-based science to succeed in urban schools,
   teachers must play an important role in enacting the curriculum while
   addressing the unique needs of students. The aim of this article is to
   describe patterns of good science teaching in urban school. (c) 2006

TI Darwin's missing link - A novel paradigm for evolution education
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID NATURAL-SELECTION; BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION; CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; STUDENTS;
   THINKING; SCIENCE; ACCEPTANCE; KNOWLEDGE; TEACHERS; BELIEFS
AB Microevolutionary mechanisms are taught almost exclusively in our
   schools, to the detriment of those mechanisms that allow us to
   understand the larger picturemacroevolution. The results are
   demonstrable; as a result of the strong emphasis on micro processes in
   evolution education, students and teachers still have poor
   understanding of the processes which operate at the macro level, and
   virtually no understanding at all of the history of life on our planet.
   Natural selection has become synonymous with the suite of processes we
   call evolution. This paper makes the case for a paradigm shift in
   evolution education, so that both perspectives-micro and macro-are
   given equal weight. Increasingly, issues of bioethics, human origins,
   cloning, etc., are being cast in a light that requires an understanding
   of macroevolution. To deny our students access to this debate is to
   deny the call for universal science literacy. A methodology from
   professional practice is proposed that could achieve this goal, and
   discussed in light of its utility, theoretical underpinnings, and
   historical legacy. A mandate for research is proposed that focuses on
   learners' understanding of several challenging macroevolutionary
   concepts, including species, the formation of higher groups, deep time,
   and hierarchical thinking. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The purposes of this study were to (a) gain an understanding of the
   views of inquiry held by faculty members involved in undergraduate
   science teaching and (b) describe the challenges, constraints, and
   opportunities that they perceived in designing and teaching
   inquiry-based laboratories. Participants included 19 college
   professors, representing both life and physical science disciplines,
   from (a) 2-year community college, (b) small, private nonprofit liberal
   arts college, (c) public master's granting university, and (d) public
   doctoral/research extensive university. We collected data through
   sernistructured interviews and applied an iterative data analysis
   process. College science faculty members held a "full and open inquiry"
   view, seeing classroom inquiry as time consuming, unstructured, and
   student directed. They believed that inquiry was more appropriate for
   upper level science majors than for introductory or nonscience majors.
   Although faculty members valued inquiry, they perceived limitations of
   time, class size, student motivation, and student ability. These
   limitations, coupled with their view of inquiry, constrained them from
   implementing inquiry-based laboratories. Our proposed inquiry continuum
   represents a broader view of inquiry that recognizes the interaction
   between two dimensions of inquiry: (a) the degree of inquiry and (b)
   the level of student directedness, and provides for a range of
   inquiry-based classroom activities. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This article describes the development and field test of an instrument,
   the Views on Science and Education Questionnaire, designed to measure
   participants' concepts of the nature of science (NOS) and relevant
   teaching attitudes. The questionnaire includes 15 questions, each
   followed by several items representing different philosophical
   positions. Participants rank each item on a five-point scale. The items
   were empirically based and described from the learners' perspectives,
   but the issues and subcategories covered were validated by a panel of
   experts. The latest version was administered to 302 college students.
   Combined conceptions and conflicting thoughts about NOS were detected.
   Furthermore, the instrument achieved a test-retest correlation
   coefficient of 0.82. The questionnaire is a valid and practical tool
   that can be used to determine participants' conceptions and attitudes
   toward teaching NOS. With this instrument, science educators and
   teachers can conduct comparison studies and relate views of NOS to
   other measurable educational outcomes. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study explores seventh graders' use of inscriptions in a
   teacher-designed project-based science unit. To investigate students'
   teaming practices during the 8-month water quality unit, we collected
   multiple sources of data (e.g., classroom video recordings, student
   artifacts, and teacher interviews) and employed analytical methods that
   drew from a naturalistic approach. The findings showed that throughout
   the unit, provided with the teachers' scaffold and social, conceptual,
   and material resources, the seventh graders were able to use various
   inscriptions (e.g., digital pictures, Web pages, and models) to
   demonstrate meaningful inscriptional practices such as creating and
   using inscriptions to make arguments, to represent conceptual
   understandings, and to engage in thoughtful discussions. Inscriptions
   and associated practices provided students with experiences and
   understandings about certain ways to organize, transform, and link data
   or scientific ideas. However, when constructing inscriptions, students
   did not consider how the inscriptions could serve certain reasoning
   purposes. In addition, more scaffolds were needed to help students use
   multiple inscriptions to make a coherent argument. (c) 2006 Wiley

AB This research focused on the interactionist conceptual ecologies of
   inservice teachers and how these ecologies influenced these teachers'
   conceptual frameworks for the nature of science (NOS). The participants
   in the study were five teachers enrolled in a graduate course focused
   on NOS. Data included participants' responses to open-ended and Likert
   scale surveys, interviews, writing prompts, and participant
   observations of classroom sessions. We propose a model of the
   interaction of the prominent components of teachers' conceptual
   ecologies for NOS, one in which learning dispositions, understandings
   of the broad enterprise of science, and orientation to learning and
   learners are understood to shape teachers' conceptual frameworks for
   NOS. The complex ties between NOS conceptions and goals, affect,
   dispositions, and beliefs speak to the inclusion of the bounded nature
   of science as a central aspect of NOS for practicing teachers.
   Teachers' dispositions toward learning this construct are linked to
   their conceptions of the boundaries of science as well as their
   understanding of the role of NOS in their own teaching. We argue that a
   recognition of the bounded nature of science forearounds actions of a
   teacher's learning disposition, thus potentially minimizing the
   influence of their religious beliefs. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; STUDENTS VIEWS; KNOWLEDGE; BELIEFS; INQUIRY
AB Teacher education programs have met with limited success in improving
   teachers' understanding of the nature of science (NOS). Research
   suggests that such efforts could be enhanced by addressing NOS in
   preservice teachers' science courses. We planned NOS instruction in a
   physical science content course for preservice elementary teachers. Our
   first concern was the NOS views of the instructors for the course,
   which included undergraduate teaching assistants (UTAs). We examined
   the NOS views of nine UTAs, and the impact of job-embedded professional
   development on their views. Although initially UTAs held a number of
   views inconsistent with science education reforms, four modes of
   explicit-and-reflective interventions, including analysis of NOS views
   of preservice teachers, resulted in favorable changes in UTAs' views.

AB This study explored preservice teachers' (n = 25) knowledge structures
   and their mastery of content knowledge in relation to their ability to
   diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of a fourth grader's videotaped
   explanations of a scientific phenomenon, i.e., molecular kinetic
   properties of air. Participants' knowledge structures were analyzed
   using flow maps before and following a unit of instruction on molecular
   kinetic properties of air. Participants' diagnostic scores were
   obtained before and after instruction. An additional diagnostic score
   used to explore relationships between knowledge structures and
   participants' abilities to apply understandings in a novel task was
   obtained following instruction. Findings include a significant increase
   in the mean number of diagnostic scores following instruction (t = 5.6;
   p <= 0.00) and a positive correlation (r = 0.58; p <= 0.02) between
   knowledge structure complexity and participants' ability to diagnose
   the child's thinking on a novel molecular kinetics task. Implications
   for teacher education programs are discussed. (c) 2006 Wiley

AB This study examines the development of teachers' metastrategic
   knowledge (MSK), a component of metacognitive knowledge, in the context
   of higher order thinking. Participants were 14 junior high school and
   high school science teachers who attended a professional development
   course. Data collection was carried out by triangulation of several
   data sources: classroom observations, individual interviews, written
   assignments, and recordings of discussions that took place during the
   course. The Findings section provides a detailed analysis of the
   professional development of 2 teachers, as well as an analysis of the
   development of the 14 teachers as a group. The data provide evidence
   for the types of knowledge teachers need for applying MSK in the course
   of instruction, the most specific of which are MSK of thinking skills
   (that must be explicit) and pedagogical knowledge regarding MSK. The
   considerable overall development in teachers' MSK following an
   in-service course consisted of at least 3 different patterns of
   development: (a) learning MSK regarding new thinking skills, (b)
   transforming initially implicit metalevel knowledge into explicit
   metalevel knowledge, and (c) introducing changes in the class culture
   to value new forms of discourse regarding thinking. The implications
   for professional development courses in this field are discussed.

TI Dialogue in the classroom
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB There is increasing agreement among those who study classrooms that
   learning is likely to be most effective when students are actively
   involved in the dialogic coconstruction of meaning about topics that
   are of significance to them. This article reports the results of an
   extended collaborative action research project in which teachers
   attempted to create the conditions for such dialogue by adopting an
   inquiry approach to the curriculum. A quantitative comparison between
   observations made early and late in the teachers' involvement in the
   project showed a number of significant changes in the characteristics
   of teacher-whole-class discourse, with a shift toward a more dialogic
   mode of interaction. Nevertheless, the initiation-response-follow-up
   (IRF) genre continued to be pervasive. Despite this, when the same
   observations were examined qualitatively, there was clear evidence of
   an increase over time in the teachers' adoption of a "dialogic stance."
   The article concludes with a consideration of the relationship between
   the choice of discourse formats and the enactment of a dialogic stance.

ID STUDENTS; EXPERT
AB Over the last two decades, a significant body of research has
   documented the nature of intuitive physics knowledge-the knowledge of
   the world that students bring to the learning of formal physics.
   However, this research has yet to document the roles played by
   intuitive physics knowledge in expert physics practice. In this
   article, I discuss three related questions: (1) What role, if any, does
   intuitive knowledge play in physics problem solving? (2) How does
   intuitive physics knowledge change in order to play that role, if at
   all? (3) When and how do these changes typically occur? In answer to
   these questions, I attempt to show that intuitive physics knowledge can
   play a variety of roles in expert problem solving, including some roles
   that are central and directly connected to equations. This research
   draws on observations of college students working in pairs to solve
   physics problems. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study explores the effectiveness of a cooperative learning (CL)
   approach, where students work together and elaborate concepts of
   physics. The group problem-solving tasks were conceptual questions from
   physics, where the students had to discuss and provide explanations of
   some phenomena. The effectiveness of the learning-in-groups approach
   was validated and correlated with working group interactiveness. Two
   group variables were assigned: the group performance and the group
   activity. These variables and the subjects' participation variable were
   correlated with achievement. Discourse analysis revealed variation in
   the nature of the interactions and information exchange, and the two
   roles as learners and learning facilitators. In addition, the study
   provided evidence for some features of cooperative learning that could
   characterize it as a nonlinear dynamical process. Implications of the
   findings are discussed. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID ALTERNATIVE FRAMEWORKS; KNOWLEDGE; MODELS; IDEAS
AB Students' conceptions are characterized by some authors as having a
   high degree of coherence while, in the minds of others, they show
   little coherence and great heterogeneity. The objective of this study
   was to throw light on this problem by reference to the particulate
   nature of matter, a topic where great discrepancies have been observed
   in the degree of coherence shown by students. We interviewed 43
   students aged 9-22 years to evaluate the coherence of their replies,
   using a questionnaire in which different methodological strategies are
   incorporated, as will be explained below. A qualitative analysis of the
   students' replies to the interviewer's questions permitted a group of
   empirical categories to be established, which were then arranged
   hierarchically. The quantitative analysis of these categories gave rise
   to new categories, which we call structural categories. These permitted
   us to select the most significant variables, to identify the different
   types of conceptions held by the subjects and to assign to each a given
   level of conceptualization. They also revealed the high degree of
   coherence in the replies given to different tasks. The usefulness of
   the proposed method for studying students' conceptions and for
   evaluating their degree of coherence is confirmed. (c) 2006 Wiley

AB This study examined university students' perceptions about a required
   laptop program. For higher education, providing experiences with
   computer tools tends to be one of the prerequisites to professional
   success because employers value extensive experience with information
   technology. Several universities are initiating laptop programs where
   all students are required to purchase laptop computers. The success of
   these laptop programs rely heavily on the extent to which the laptop
   environment is accepted and wholeheartedly implemented by students and
   faculty. Defining the logistical and technological factors necessary to
   successfully implement a laptop program becomes a critical issue to the
   success of the program. By understanding what logistical and
   technological factors are critical to students, such a program can be
   made more useful to students as well as more beneficial to universities.

DE visualization; study strategy; concept mapping; science learning
AB Mixed methods were adopted to explore the effects of student- generated
   visualization on paper and on computers as a study strategy for middle
   school science concept learning. In a post- test- only- control- group
   design, scores were compared among a control- group ( n= 28), a group
   that was trained to visualize on paper ( n= 30), and a group that was
   trained to visualize on computers ( n= 34). The paper group and the
   computer group performed significantly better on the post- test than
   the control group. Visualization as a study strategy had positive
   effects whether students used paper or computers to generate their
   visualizations. However, no significant difference existed between the
   paper group and the computer group's scores. Qualitative results
   indicated that students who were trained to visualize on paper or on
   computers had positive attitudes toward the use of visualization as a
   study strategy, and they engaged more in purposeful tasks during study
   time than the control group. However, several participants in the
   computer group felt negatively about the use of visualization; they
   claimed that visualization demanded too much time and effort. Attitudes
   toward visualization as a study strategy differed within groups
   indicating that visualization might interact with learner
   characteristics.

AB This study investigates the effectiveness of computer-mediated
   Engineering Drawing instruction in improving spatial ability namely
   spatial visualisation and mental rotation. A multi factorial quasi
   experimental design study was employed involving a cohort of 138, 20
   year old average undergraduates. Three interventional treatments were
   administered, namely Interactive Engineering Drawing Trainer ( EDwgT),
   conventional instruction using printed materials enhanced with digital
   video clips, and conventional instruction using printed materials only.
   Using an experimental 3 x 2 x 2 factorial design, the research has
   found statistical significant improvements in spatial visualisation
   tasks. There appears to be no improvement in reaction times for Mental
   Rotation. The authors also have investigated the gender differences and
   the influence of prior experience of spatial ability.

ID PSYCHOLOGY; VIDEO; PLAY
AB Recent research demonstrates that videogames enhance literacy,
   attention, reaction time, and higher-level thinking. Several scholars
   have suggested that massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) such as
   Everquest and Second Life have educational potential, but we have
   little data about what happens when such tools are introduced in the
   classroom. This paper reports findings from two MMO- based courses in
   the context of situated learning theory. The first course, focused on
   the ethnography of on- line games, used the game Everquest as a vehicle
   for teaching research methods to 36 students in an undergraduate
   communication course. The second course used the game Second Life to
   teach the fundamentals of videogame design and criticism. Synthesizing
   comments from student web logs with data collected from followup
   surveys, the paper highlights key findings and offers concrete
   suggestions for instructors contemplating the use of multiplayer games
   in their own courses. Recommending that potential virtual environments
   be selected on the basis of genre, accessibility, and extensibility, it
   is suggested that game- based assignments are most effective when they
   build bridges between the domain of the game world and an overlapping
   domain of professional practice.

ID EXAMPLES
AB For the past five years, our students have been passing less and less
   time preparing for lectures and exams. To encourage them to do more
   exercises, a pedagogical activity was offered outside the classroom.
   With the goal of making students more active during the problem-
   solving process, an innovative online environment, Sphinx, was
   developed. Sphinx proposes a set of exercises with their solutions, and
   invites students to explain them. Sphinx also gives students the
   opportunity to exchange ideas about an exercise and its solution, and
   gives the teacher the ability to observe if students take part in the
   problem- solving process. The originality of Sphinx lies in its ability
   to support students between lectures with a common learning strategy:
   learning- by- example. An experiment was conducted with 137 students
   during the 2003 fall session. The solved exercises were consulted most
   often before the two exams. However, only a few students participated
   actively in the experiment by intensively using the Sphinx environment;
   they obtained a better average score than the rest of the class. Thus,
   participation and collaboration had a positive effect on the students'
   marks. Tools should be added to motivate more students to take part in
   the explaining and collaborating process.

SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of one year of
   regular "LEGO" training on pupils' performances in schools. The
   underlying pedagogical perspective is the constructivist theory, where
   the main idea is that knowledge is constructed in the mind of the pupil
   by active learning.
   The investigation has been made in two steps. The first step was before
   the training and the second after training. For both cases we have
   constructed and included control groups. A logistic model is applied to
   the data under consideration to investigate whether the LEGO training
   leads to improving pupil's performance in the schools. To analyse the
   opinion studies, GLM for matched pair models and the Quasi symmetry
   methods have been used. Preliminary results show better performances in
   mathematics for the trained group in grade five, and pupils who are
   good at mathematics tend to be more engaged and seem to be more
   successful when working with LEGO.
   The study has also shown that pupils have different learning styles in
   their approach to LEGO training. The role of the teacher, as a mediator
   of knowledge and skills, was crucial for coping with problems related
   to this kind of technology. The teacher must be able to support the
   pupils and to make them understand the LEGO Dacta material on a deeper

DE computer-assisted interviewing; data collection; data quality
AB Although computer-assisted interview tools have much potential, little
   empirical evidence on the quality and quantity of data generated by
   these tools has been collected. In this study we compared the effects
   of using Virre, a computer-assisted self-interview tool, with the
   effects of using other data collection methods, such as written
   responding and face- to- face interviewing, on data quantity and
   quality. An intra- sample, counter- balanced, repeated- measures
   experiment was used with 20 students enrolled in a computer science
   education program. It was found that there were significantly more
   words and unique clauses per response in the Virre condition than in
   the written response condition; however, the odds of avoiding in- depth
   responding were much greater in the Virre condition than in the written
   response condition. The effect sizes observed in this study indicated
   that there was a greater quantity of data and a higher rate of response
   avoidance during Virre data collection than what would have been
   expected, based on previous literature, during face- to- face data
   collection. Although these results statistically generalize to our
   sample only, these results indicate that audio- visual, computer-
   assisted self- interviewing can yield as high, or higher, quality of
   data as other commonly- used data collection methods.

ID KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
AB National legislation that increased the role of accountability testing
   has created pressure to use testing data, along with other data, for
   instructional decision-making. Connected to this push for data-driven
   decisionmaking, is the increased interest in data delivery systems or
   Management Information Systems (MIS) in education. But, before
   administrators rush to build data and information systems, we argue for
   a careful review of existing knowledge about information systems in the
   education sector in light of what business and organizational research
   already knows about information systems. We draw on the considerable
   body of business and organizational research on MIS and a recent
   educational case study in New York City to introduce a theoretical
   framework to describe the process from data to decision- making in
   schools. Our exploration of how schools use information focuses on the
   potential of new technologies and new ways of analysis to meet the
   information needs of educators across different levels of the system.
   We conclude with a discussion about critical factors for the
   development and implementation of effective information systems for
   schools: 1) Build from the real needs of classroom and building
   educators; 2) Recognize teachers' wealth of tacit knowledge as a
   starting point; 3) Select appropriate data to include in the
   information system; 4) Effective testing requires close alignment
   between standards, teaching and testing; 5) Educators need professional
   development on instructional decision- making that considers the role
   of data; 6) Educators need expanded repertoires of instructional
   strategies; and 7) Further research on effective instructional
   decision- making and IS support is needed.

AB One-to-one technology enhanced learning research refers to the design
   and investigation of learning environments and learning activities
   where every learner is equipped with at least one portable computing
   device enabled by wireless capability. G1: 1 is an international
   research community coordinated by a network of laboratories conducting
   one- to- one technology enhanced learning. The concept of component
   exchange community emerged as a means of realizing one of the missions
   of G1: 1 - speeding up researches through exchanges of research
   components. Possible types of research components include software,
   subject matter content ( learning objects), and methodologies. It aims
   at building a platform for fostering international collaboration,
   providing a novel way for the research work by an individual or
   laboratories to be accessed by the wider research community and users,
   and, in return, increasing research impacts of these researches.
   Component exchange community motivates maintenance of good quality
   documentation. This paper describes the concept and its model of
   component exchange community. Related models are compared and, as an
   illustration, a scenario of using component exchange community is given.

DE constructivist approach; critical thinking; thinking skills; academic
   support; consultative environment; ICT-mediation
AB South African Universities are tasked with increasing student
   throughput by offering additional academic support. A second task is to
   teach students to challenge and question. One way of attempting to
   achieve these tasks is by using Information and Communication
   Technology (ICT). The focus of this paper is to examine the effect of
   using an ICT tool to both increase academic support to students, and to
   teach critical thinking skills.
   A field study comparing a Project Management course at the University
   of Cape Town over two successive years was conducted. In the second
   year an ICT mediated constructivist approach ( DFAQ web site) in which
   students acquired project management skills was used to increase
   support and teach critical thinking skills. Structuration theory, in
   particular the notion of practical and discursive consciousness, was
   used to inform our understanding of the role of questioning on teaching
   project management.
   The conclusion is that a constructive approach, mediated by an
   anonymous web-based consultative environment, the Dynamic Frequently
   Asked Questions ( DFAQ) improved support to students and had an effect
   on student learning of project management and students acquired some
   questioning skills as evidenced in the examination performance. The
   efficacy of the approach was evaluated both through an interpretive
   study of DFAQ artefacts and the performance in the examination.
   The paper examines relevant literature, details the research
   objectives, describes a field survey, and the results.

AB In this study, we investigated the effect of type of positive
   interdependence (roles, rewards, roles-plus-rewards, or no structure)
   and affiliation motives (high vs. low) in an asynchronous,
   collaborative learning environment. College reentry students worked
   together in small, fully online discussion groups that lasted for seven
   days. Results indicated that participants in groups given roles plus
   rewards interacted with their teammates significantly more than those
   given rewards only or no-structured-interdependence conditions. A
   significant positive correlation suggested that participants with
   higher numbers of interactions attained higher posttest scores.
   However, no significant differences were found in achievement by type
   of interdependence or by affiliation motive. Results also revealed that
   type of interdependence and affiliation motive had a significant impact
   on student attitudes. Implications for integrating small group work in
   online higher education settings are discussed.

AB This article proposes a model that integrates the traditionally
   conflicting objectivist and constructivist approaches to instructional
   design. I argue that these two approaches are complementary rather than
   oppositional. I present and analyze two learning programs in order to
   show how learning events can contain both objectivist and
   constructivist elements. By plotting the two approaches at right angles
   to one another, I produce four quadrants which I then discuss and
   explain. What follows after that is a discussion of comments that were
   received from members of a prominent instructional technology mailing
   list about the feasibility of the model. Finally I present two case
   studies. The first describes a two-day workshop that was designed to be
   high on both axes, while the second shows how the model could be used
   as a decision-making tool. Initial findings suggest that it is both
   feasible and useful to plot objectivism and constructivism at right
   angles to one another rather than at opposite ends of a continuum.

AB This study investigated the effect of conceptual change text-oriented
   instruction over traditional instruction on students' understanding of
   solution concepts (e.g., dissolving, solubility, factors affecting
   solubility, concentrations of solutions, types of solutions, physical
   properties of solutions) and their attitudes towards chemistry. The
   sample of this study consisted of 87 undergraduate students from two
   classes enrolled in an introductory chemistry course. One of the
   classes was assigned randomly to the control group, and the other class
   were assigned randomly to the experimental group. During teaching the
   topic of solution concepts in the chemistry curriculum, a conceptual
   change text-oriented instruction was applied in the experimental group
   whereas traditional instruction was followed in the control group. The
   results showed that the students in the experimental group performed
   better with respect to solution concepts. In addition, it has been
   found that there was no significant difference between the attitudes of
   students in the experimental and control groups towards chemistry.

ID PRESERVICE ELEMENTARY TEACHERS
AB Self-efficacy has been shown to be an issue of concern for primary
   teacher education students - many of them have low self-efficacy and
   this can negatively affect their future teaching of science. Previous
   research has identified four factors that may contribute towards
   self-efficacy: enactive mastery experiences, vicarious experiences,
   verbal persuasion and physiological/affective states. It could also be
   argued that there are additional sources of self-efficacy that apply to
   primary teacher education students, namely cognitive content mastery,
   cognitive pedagogical mastery and simulated modelling. The main purpose
   of the present paper was to investigate the relative importance of the
   various sources of self-efficacy in a primary science methods course.
   Data on changes in self-efficacy and sources of self-efficacy were
   collected throughout the course using formal and informal surveys. It
   was found that the main source of self-efficacy was cognitive
   pedagogical mastery.

ID SCIENCE-EDUCATION
AB The article is addressing how students reason about the origin and
   development of the universe. Students' own views as well as their
   descriptions of physical models are analysed. Data consists of written
   surveys, and interviews of a subset of the students. Most of the
   students relate to the Big Bang model when describing the origin of the
   universe. The study however shows that this can mean different things
   to the students. The article also addresses views of whether or not the
   universe changes and of the origin of the elements. When comparing
   students' own views with their views of the physics view this study
   shows that there are students who have a different view of their own
   than the view they connect with physics. This shows that students, in
   the area of cosmology, do not necessarily take the view they connect
   with physics to be their own. Examples of students who handle the
   physics view in different ways are discussed. There are students who
   relate not only to science but also to a religious worldview when
   describing their own view. This shows that when discussing cosmology in
   class, also a religious worldview can be relevant for parts of the
   student group.

   milieus (urban, peri-urban and rural settings of schools) have an
   effect on any cognitive gains that may be made by learners. The
   findings were that there is a clear and statistically significant
   improvement in the mean test scores on problem-solving and reasoning of
   pupils who participated in the classroom discussion initiative
   (exploratory talk) over those of the comparison groups. This result was
   consistent in both the first- and second-studies that were undertaken.
   There was also a significant difference between the gains in
   problem-solving and reasoning test scores of the three
   socio-geographical settings in which the participating schools are
   found.

AB This paper investigated the change of the Junior Secondary School
   Chemistry Curriculum (JSSCC) in the P. R. China over the period from
   1978 to 2001. Document analysis was employed as the research method and
   data were collected from various versions of teaching syllabi,
   textbooks, and teachers' reference books published during this period.
   The changes of the purposes and content of the JSSCC were traced in the
   view of scientific literacy, which incorporates both subject matter and
   companion meanings in the light of the concept of 'curriculum
   emphases.' It was found that subject matter had been increasingly
   enlarged in its breadth but its requirements gradually decreased while
   companion meanings at different levels of this curriculum had been
   increasingly added from 1978 to 2001. On the basis of these findings it
   was concluded that the JSSCC had experienced a transition from being
   more elite to more future citizenry oriented during the period under
   study. Two implications of this study for science curriculum research
   were discussed.

AB This article reports on the third year of a three-year longitudinal
   investigation into six secondary students' understanding of optics at a
   secondary school level. In the third year of this investigation the
   students, who by now were in Year 12, underwent a teaching sequence
   that centred on the teaching and learning of physical optics and
   quantum ideas. The students' mental models of the nature of light were
   explored prior to, and following this teaching sequence. The researcher
   took on the dual roles of teacher and researcher. This paper will
   outline the findings of the third year of this study and the
   implications they have for the teaching and learning of optics at

DE tablet PC; instructional technology; higher education; electronic

AB This paper describes a pilot project with the purpose of evaluating the
   usefulness of tablet PCs for university professors. The focus is on the
   value of tablets primarily with respect to teaching and learning (and
   not for research or administrative work). Sixty-four professors,
   distributed across the various schools of a university, were provided
   with tablet PCs and were trained in their use. A survey was distributed
   to the participants at the end of the semester. There were 59
   respondents, and of these 45 used the tablet in at least one of their
   classes. This paper describes the pilot project and the survey results.
   We observed that a) only a fraction of faculty are motivated to use
   tablet technology: roughly a third of faculty expressed an interest in
   replacing their notebook computer with a tablet computer and b)
   generally, participating faculty did indeed use tablet functionality in
   their classes and were convinced that this use resulted in a meaningful
   impact on teaching and learning.

AB Currently available courseware packages for teaching the work unit may
   not meet different students' needs. Also, a single teacher, even with
   tools, is likely to have difficulties and may need cooperation of other
   teachers in dealing with students' problems in the learning unit. This
   research aims to devise a set of computer based tools to meet the
   diverse needs of learners to comprehend a science learning unit. A
   model of computer based tools on the learning unit for developing
   procedural knowledge to solve work problems was developed together with
   a set of teacher customization and collaboration tools. The main
   components, developed and implemented in an integrated manner for both
   students and teachers, are Student Activity Environment, Curriculum
   Authoring Center, Global Activity Center and Teacher Collaboration
   Tools. The framework of supporting students through teachers'
   collaborative course authoring, considering the different backgrounds
   of the students and preferred teaching/learning style of
   teachers/students, was evaluated with students using two different task
   regimes. The evaluation studies presented encouraging and promising
   results.

ID STUDENT PERCEPTIONS; TECHNOLOGY; UNIVERSITY; ATTITUDES
AB The idea underlying this study is that the prospective teachers develop
   their Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skills throughout
   the learning process supported by the Problem Based Learning (PBL), a
   method that produces independent learners who can, then, continue to
   learn on their own in their chosen careers. The major goal of the
   study, conducted in two phases during two academic years, is to
   investigate the differential effects of PBL and conventional
   teacher-centred instruction on cognitive and a group of affective
   variables which have been coined "technophobia". Phase I of the study,
   entirely qualitative in character, covered a case study in which a
   total of 111 students from three departments of the Faculty of
   Education took part. Phase II of the study was quasi-experimental in
   nature with 79 students taking part. Most of the outcomes from Phase II
   were based on statistical measurements. At the end of the instruction
   process, the findings indicated that, while there was no significant
   difference in the anxiety levels of the two groups, the number of
   successful students had registered a considerable increase.
   Furthermore, the students, actively involved in the learning process,
   solving real problems, viewed the PBL as an effective learning tool
   rich in motivation. Within this framework, the motivating role of ICT
   as a method of learning is automatically recognised.

   rule-based problem solving in an interactive multimedia environment.
   Forty-five college students were recruited and assigned to two groups:
   synchronized and unsynchronized interactive multimedia groups based on
   their spatial ability score. Results show that students in the
   synchronized interactive multimedia group outperformed their
   counterparts in the unsynchronized interactive multimedia group in
   terms of response time and test scores. Results also indicated that low
   spatial ability learners in the synchronized interactive multimedia
   showed an improvement in problem solving.

AB The growing use of the Internet in learning environments has led to new
   models being created addressing specific learning domains, as well as
   more general educational goals. In particular, in recent years
   considerable attention has been paid to collaborative learning
   supported by technology, because this mode can enhance peer interaction
   and group work.
   Among the different active learning strategies, Cooperative Learning
   has found in the Internet and the World Wide Web the ideal
   technological support. In this scenario, we have implemented a
   web-based environment, endeavouring to reproduce within it the
   traditional teaching methodologies typical of cooperative learning.
   Herein we describe two experiments aiming to assess the quantity and
   quality of the interaction promoted by the system and how such factors
   as gender, background knowledge and role affect communication. We
   compared the communication and the learning gain achieved in the
   experimental group that worked with the system, named Geometriamo, with
   those achieved in the control group working in class with the teacher.
   The results demonstrate that the use of an environment mediating
   peer-to-peer collaboration can be highly beneficial, even in primary
   school age. A high number of messages were exchanged among all pupils
   and, notably, the highest learning gain was recorded in the less able
   students in the experimental group.

AB This study concerns applying Web-based learning with learner controlled
   instructional materials in a geometry course. The experimental group
   learned in a Web-based learning environment, and the control group
   learned in a classroom. We observed that the learning method accounted
   for a total variation in learning effect of 19.1% in the 3rd grade and
   36.5% in the 6th grade. The main factor in the difference was
   attributed to the students' ability to apply information technology. We
   further found that students need more communication with peers,
   teachers, and lecture materials when learning via the Internet. We are
   encouraged that progress in the technological advances of the Internet
   will make it more convenient and more effective for use in Web-based
   learning.

AB The main goal of this study is to estimate the extent to which
   perceived innovation characteristics are associated with the
   probability of task related ICT use among secondary school teachers.
   The tasks were categorized as teaching preparation, teaching delivery,
   and management. Four hundred and sixteen teachers from secondary
   schools in Turkey, completed a questionnaire, which was designed to
   determine the task-related usage and the perceptions of the teachers in
   regard to ICT. Logistic stepwise regression analysis showed that
   complexity or ease of use was found to be a common perceived innovation
   characteristic for teaching delivery, preparation and managerial tasks
   in schools. Another result of this survey lead one to conclude that
   observability is a perceived attribute in teaching delivery in some
   specific tasks performed during the class period whereas relative
   advantage and compatibility are for teaching preparation tasks.

AB After the evaluation of numerous technology integration programs in
   school districts and universities, it is recognized that the existence
   of technology does not guarantee its utilization in the classroom
   environment. Although many models and theories have tried to explain
   the contributing factors in technology acceptance, most of the models
   and theories have focused on technology-related factors. This study
   focused on educational ideology, a factor not related to technology
   that also affects decisions in terms of educational applications. Based
   on the literature review, we hypothesized a new model of technology
   acceptance which includes educational ideology as an external factor.
   We attempted to create a model that was compatible with our
   hypothesized model by collecting data from surveys completed by 320
   pre-service teachers. Structural Equation Modeling was employed to
   create the path analytic model. The variables used in the path analytic
   model were the components of the original Technology Acceptance Model
   and six different educational ideologies. The results showed that the
   new model was consistent with the hypothesized model. Therefore, the
   results illustrate that different educational ideologies may have
   different effects on teachers' technology acceptance.

AB On-line collaboration is an instructional method that facilitates
   collaboration in an on-line learning setting. To promote effective
   collaboration, it is vital to reveal both the student's and the
   instructor's point of view pertaining to effective on-line
   collaboration. In this study, the effectiveness of a learning
   management system in on-line collaboration was first investigated in a
   graduate course offered through the means of distance learning. In this
   first phase of this study, the nature of collaboration, the students
   perceptions of the effectiveness of the tool in on-line collaboration,
   the factors contributing to effective peer interaction among students
   and the role of the instructor as perceived by the students in the
   on-line course were explored. This phase of the study also involved the
   reviews of other learning management systems, course management systems
   and groupware systems regarding the tools used to encourage
   collaboration. Also revealed was a lack of diversity in collaboration
   tools. Based on these preliminary findings, an on-line document
   reviewing tool was developed and pilot tested in the second phase of
   the study. In this phase, a web-based synchronous collaborative review
   tool called WebSCoRe is proposed to promote online collaboration.
   WebSCoRe is proposed as an attempt to develop and implement a new
   platform for on-line document reviewing, to promote effective on-line
   collaboration among students and the instructor.

ID EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE
AB This paper presents the pedagogical usability criteria for evaluating
   the digital learning material. Pedagogical aspects of designing or
   using digital learning material are much less frequently studied than
   technical ones. Further, there are relatively few inventories measuring
   subjective end-user satisfaction with the pedagogical aspects of
   digital learning material and not a single inventory has undergone a
   rigorous process of empirical psychometric testing. They include the
   following components: 1. Learner control, 2. Learner activity, 3.
   Cooperative/Collaborative learning, 4. Goal orientation, 5.
   Applicability, 6. Added value, 7. Motivation, 8. Valuation of previous
   knowledge, 9. Flexibility and 10. Feedback. The pedagogical usability
   criteria have been operationalized into an on-line Likert -scale
   self-rating Pedagogically Meaningful Learning Questionnaire ( PMLQ)
   that has 56 items. In the PMLQ, separate items have been developed to
   measure the usability of the learning management system (LMS) and the
   learning material (LM). When evaluating the usability of a LMS, it is
   possible in the pedagogical context to evaluate the kind of learning
   material it enables the users to produce. Evaluation of the usability
   of a LM is based on a fact that the learning content is based on a
   certain learning goal or goals. The criteria of pedagogical usability
   presented here have undergone two-step psychometric testing process
   using empirical samples of 5th and 6th grade elementary school students
   (n = 66 and n = 74). Students evaluated one LMS and four LM's with
   PMLQ. Results supported the existence of theoretical dimensions of the
   criteria. The PMLQ was able to capture differences in the pedagogical
   usability profiles of the learning modules. Generalizability of the
   pedagogical usability criteria to other domains is limited by the small
   sample size, the small age range of respondents' and the small number
   of learning material evaluated. However, empirical studies that aim at
   evaluating a more representative set of learning material in different
   domains targeted for both adolescent and adult learners are currently
   conducted.

AB Semantically rich domains require operative knowledge to solve complex
   problems in real-world settings. These domains provide an ideal
   environment for developing authentic constructivist e-learning
   environments. In this paper we present a framework and a methodology
   for developing authentic learning environments for such domains. The
   framework is based on an ecological view and characterizes dimensions
   of a typical constructivist environment in terms of pedagogical design,
   architecture, the environmental context and what is actually learned. A
   case-study illustrating the use of the framework to develop a
   just-in-time game-based learning environment is also presented.

ID EDUCATION
AB Despite large investments by higher education institutions in
   technology for faculty and student use, instructional technology is not
   being integrated into instruction in higher education institutions
   including medical education institutions. While the diffusion of
   instructional technologies has reached a saturation point among early
   adopters of technology, it has remained limited among the mainstream
   faculty. This investigation explores instructional technology usage
   patterns and the characteristics of medical school faculty as well as
   contributing factors to IT adoption. The focus of the study was to
   explore the differences between faculty members who have adopted new
   technology and those reluctant or resistant to IT adoption, and to
   determine whether faculty characteristics contribute to the prediction
   of faculty adopter categories. Faculties from the disciplines of basic
   and clinical science at a state university Faculty of Medicine were
   surveyed to gather data concerning faculty characteristics, adoption
   patterns, perceptions of computer-use self efficacy, the value of IT,
   barriers and incentives to adoption and preferences related to help and
   support in technology adoption. The data analysis was based on Rogers'
   theories of diffusion and adopter categories. Significant differences
   were found between early adopters and the mainstream faculty in terms
   of individual characteristics, adoption patterns, perceptions of
   barriers and technology learning preferences The results indicated that
   computer use self efficacy and rank significantly contribute to the
   prediction of faculty adopter group.

ID SYSTEMS
AB We report an approach for implementing predictive fuzzy systems that
   manage capturing both the imprecision of the empirically induced
   classifications and the imprecision of the intuitive linguistic
   expressions via the extensive use of fuzzy sets. From end-users' point
   of view, the approach enables encapsulating the technical details of
   the underlying information system in terms of an intuitive linguistic
   interface. We describe a novel technical syntax of fuzzy descriptions
   and expressions, and outline the related systems of fuzzy linguistic
   queries and rules. To illustrate the method, we describe it in terms of
   a concrete educational user modelling application. We report
   experiments with two data sets, describing the records of the students
   attending to a university mathematics course in 2003 and 2004. In
   brief, we aim identifying the failing students of the year 2004, and
   develop a procedure for empirically inducing and assigning each student
   a fuzzy property "poor", which helps capturing the students needing
   extra assistance. In the educational context, the approach enables the
   construction of applications exploiting simple and intuitive student
   models, that to certain extent are self-evident.

AB Collaborative work is an important part of tertiary education but it is
   very difficult to arrange and supervise for extremely large classes of
   students in their first year. The possibility that computer-mediated
   communication can be used to facilitate this type of learning is
   appealing from a pragmatic organisational point of view. This paper
   explains in detail what a 'virtual team' is in the educational context.
   It reports on an interpretive field study where students taking an
   introductory course were allowed to choose where and when they did the
   required collaborative work. The paper discusses the factors that
   should be taken into account when offering students the option of
   working as a virtual team. These include factors that influence the
   students' choice. The project cannot be considered to have been
   successful but indicates reasons for the lack of success and suggests
   contexts in which it would be valuable to repeat the project. The
   importance of extensive preparation in terms of teaching the students
   necessary social and technological skills cannot be over emphasised.

AB The objects-first strategy to teaching programming has prevailed over
   the imperative-first and functional-first strategies during the last
   decade. However, the objects-first strategy has created added
   difficulties to both the teaching and learning of programming. In an
   attempt to confront these difficulties and support the objects-first
   strategy we developed a novel programming environment, objectKarel,
   which uses the language Karel++. The design of objectKarel was based on
   the results of the extended research that has been carried out about
   novice programmers. What differentiates it from analogous environments
   is the fact that it combines features that have been used solely in
   them: incorporated e-lessons and hands-on activities; an easy to use
   structure editor for developing/editing programs; program animation;
   explanatory visualization; highly informative and friendly error
   messages; recordability. In this paper, we present the didactic
   rationale that dictated the design of objectKarel and the features of
   the environment, including the e-lessons. In addition, we present the
   results from the use of objectKarel in the classroom and the results of
   the students' assessment of the environment. (c) 2004 Published by

AB This paper compares several interface evaluation methods applied in the
   case of a computer based learning (CBL) environment, during a
   longitudinal study performed in three European countries, Greece,
   Germany, and Holland, and within the framework of an EC funded Leonardo
   da Vinci program. The paper firstly considers the particularities of
   the CBL environments presented in comparison to Distance Learning
   environments, as well as other educational pieces. Subsequently, the
   software under evaluation is described, as well as the underlying
   educational theories and the proposed instructional methodology
   regarding its effective application. In the case under study, a
   combination of expert-based and empirical (user-based) approaches are
   dealt with, and the "ideal" combination, for the consumption of the
   fewest possible resources in order to achieve the maximum outcome for
   the assessment of the software is investigated. A combinatory
   evaluation approach is argued for the provision of the best results in
   the case of complex environments such as educational ones. The results
   of this study show that both approaches, expert-based and empirical,
   have been found to perform adequately, although the empirical
   methodologies are always preferable. Therefore, this study concludes by
   proposing a combination of an expert-based approach during the early
   stages of the design cycle with an observational evaluation, performed
   by the instructors and/ or the designers, which has to provide the best
   cost/performance factor. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Previous research has shown that computer-based tasks can motivate
   people with autism and encourage learning. As a computer-based medium,
   Virtual Environments (VEs) offer a potentially useful tool for social
   skills training for people with autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs).
   However, there are some concerns over whether people with ASDs can
   understand, use and interpret the technology appropriately. This paper
   adopts a qualitative case-study approach to report observations of, and
   comments from, two adolescent boys with ASDs, gathered during a series
   of sessions using a virtual cafe and bus environment. Although there
   were signs of repetitive behaviours, literal interpretation of the
   scenes, and that the VEs were treated as not having real-world
   relevance, these were not the dominant modes of responding. Instead,
   participants seemed to interpret the scenes meaningfully and
   appreciated the opportunities to discuss appropriate social responses
   with a facilitator sitting alongside. They enjoyed using the VEs and
   provided specific examples of how the VEs had helped, or could help,
   them in the real world. This gives encouraging support for the idea
   that VEs can be used and interpreted meaningfully by at least some
   students with ASDs. The paper concludes with some considerations for
   the future development of VEs for members of this population. (c) 2004

AB This article explores the influence of prior knowledge on the setting
   of goals and use of content in museum website visits. Goal setting is a
   crucial process in organizing the activities of surfers in open
   environments, such as museum websites, where surfers faced ill-defined
   tasks. To this end, 12 graduate students were asked to surf through two
   museum websites in different domains (anthropology and natural
   sciences). Half of the participants had robust background in
   anthropology. Within each of these groups, half of the students had
   spent more than four years in graduate school, while the other half
   were first year students. Visited pages and concurrent comments were
   recorded, coded and analyzed. Results showed that domain specific
   knowledge influences goal setting process. Visitors with high domain
   knowledge tended to set larger and more consistent goal structures than
   first year students. Results showed also that general previous
   knowledge influences content use. Surfers with higher general skills
   tended to elaborate more on content and use more intensively the
   information available at the websites. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB In recent years, novel paradigms of computing have emerged, which
   enable computational power to be embedded in artefacts and in
   environments in novel ways. These developments may create new
   possibilities for using computing to enhance learning. This paper
   presents the results of a design process that set out to explore
   interactive techniques, which utilized ubiquitous computer technology,
   to stimulate active participation, involvement and learning by children
   visiting a museum. Key stakeholders, such as museum curators and
   docents, were involved throughout the process of creating the
   exhibition, Re-Tracing the Past, in the Hunt Museum, Limerick, Ireland.
   The paper describes aspects of the evaluation of the exhibition, which
   involved 326 schoolchildren (ages 9-12-year-old), and which exemplifies
   important features of the design and use of the novel technology in the
   museum. The paper concludes by articulating a series of design
   guidelines for developing ubiquitous computing to enhance children's
   learning in museums. These guidelines relate 12 experiential criteria
   to five supporting design informants and resources. The guidelines
   encompass important dimensions of children's educational experience in
   museums, including collaboration, engagement, active interpretation,
   and materiality. While developed in a museum context, these guidelines
   could be applied to the development of novel computing to enhance
   children's learning in other educational environments, both formal and
   informal.

AB This paper reports a phenomenographic investigation into students'
   experiences of learning through discussion - both online and face to
   face (F2F). The study context was a second-year undergraduate course in
   psychology for social work in which the teacher had designed discussion
   tasks to begin in F2F mode and to continue online. A combination of
   open-ended questionnaires and semi-structured interviews was used to
   investigate students' conceptions of what they were learning, their
   intentions and their approaches to learning through discussion.
   Analysis of the interview and open-ended questionnaire data identified
   a number of qualitatively different conceptions, intentions and
   approaches to learning through discussion. Associations were found
   between what students thought they were learning through discussions,
   their approaches to learning through discussion and their course grade.
   Students with a cohesive conception and students adopting a deep
   approach (to learning through online discussion) got better course
   grades. There was no significant difference between deep and surface
   approaches to F2F discussion and course grade. The outcomes of this
   study have implications for the design of online and F2F discussion
   tasks and in particular for helping students adopt richer conceptions
   of what they stand to gain through discussion.

   technology (ICT) in the course of their training. Data collection
   involved baseline and follow-up questionnaire surveys of trainees'
   attitudes to the use of ICT in subject teaching and the factors that
   they felt had hindered or promoted their development in the use of ICT,
   and focus group interviews with small groups of trainees. In spite of
   the importance attached to this facet of initial training, and
   significant investment in terms of time and training materials and
   resources, there is evidence to suggest that much of this investment is
   not found to be helpful by trainees. In particular, there appears to be
   a danger that they have simply been overwhelmed with information about
   the use of ICT to such an extent that they do not feel that they can
   realistically be expected to engage with many of the materials that
   have been produced. In addition to ascertaining trainees' views on
   strategies and interventions that they did not find helpful, the data
   identify some key factors and moments that trainees felt had a major
   impact on their progress in the use of ICT. The outcomes of the enquiry
   reveal clear preferences among trainees for modes of working with ICT,
   and in terms of the experiences that they felt had impacted on their
   ability to use ICT in their subject teaching. The concluding section of
   the paper considers the ways in which trainees' induction into the use
   of new technology might be made more effective.

AB The Modern Distance Education Project for the Rural Schools (MDEPRS) of
   China has a wider scope and serves a larger population than any other
   informational project in the world. It likely will result in a
   far-reaching informational revolution for basic education in China.
   Here, we introduce three main innovative models of material delivery,
   the recent developments of MDEPRS, and the problems associated with
   this project. We then fully discuss strategies for optimizing this
   project, such as establishing reasonable goals and directions,
   restructuring its major components, improving the delivery models and
   digital contents, sustaining its development, conducting better
   financial audit and project evaluation, and increasing community
   participation and financial investment.

   environment to support Jigsaw cooperative learning activities in a
   college setting. A quasi-experimental research design was conducted to
   investigate the effects of using handhelds, as well as issues
   associated with the use of handheld technology. Two intact classes of
   fourth-year students from a five-year junior nursing college
   participated in the experiment. Our findings showed that handheld tools
   enhanced both students' attitudes and performance in learning, and
   promoted better interactions among students and instructors. We also
   found that the handheld technology was not sophisticated enough to
   support cooperative learning goals without full support from a
   technology specialist.

AB The present study aims to explore the extent to which computer-assisted
   teaching facilitates the learning of basic mathematical concepts and
   skills in children with Down Syndrome (DS). Thus, the effectiveness of
   a multimedia teaching method is compared with a traditional one in the
   teaching of counting and cardinality abilities and concepts. In our
   study, two groups of DS children were trained. One of them was taught
   by using mathematical multimedia software whereas the other learned by
   means of pencil-paper-based tasks on the same material as the
   multimedia group. The children of both groups were evaluated before and
   after training sessions. The multimedia group showed a higher
   performance than the paper and pencil assisted teaching group on a
   variety of tasks and measures, suggesting a clear relation between
   teaching method and mathematical learning in DS children. These
   findings are discussed in terms of their theoretical as well as applied
   relevance.

TI Newly qualified teachers' learning related to their use of information
   and communication technology: a Swedish perspective
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This qualitative study focuses on newly qualified teachers' use of
   information and communication technology (ICT) as a tool for meeting
   the challenges of their everyday work. The overarching aim is to
   investigate whether they can contribute to new knowledge about learning
   in ICT contexts. Theoretical points of departure concern the changeable
   nature of learning in situations where ways of communicating knowledge
   and skills are changed. The study draws upon interviews and
   observations. The findings show intersections picturing the new
   technique as partly changing the circumstances for teaching, learning
   and collaboration between colleagues. The new teachers' utterances show
   that ICT utilisation is extensive and exhibits great variation both
   among female and among male participants. Boundary-crossing changes
   become visible in the collaboration between more experienced teachers
   and those who are newly qualified, especially when they work on a
   common development project. However, there are relatively few teachers
   who bring up active ICT use in connection with pupils' learning.
   Changed roles because of ICT competence raise questions about the
   importance of systematic ICT features within teacher education. Many of
   the newly qualified teachers wish they had more knowledge about ICT and
   related techniques. Another question is whether newly qualified
   teachers who show interest in using the technique can take on the role
   as agents of change in their active and creative use of ICT.

AB This study examined attitudes of university faculty specialising in the
   field of human resource (HR) in Taiwan towards participation in the
   teaching of online courses using the theory of reasoned action (TRA).
   The population targeted for investigation consisted of the full-time
   university faculty in the HR field in Taiwan regardless of their
   experience in the teaching online courses of any kind. Survey
   development included a detailed literature review to identify beliefs
   that guided measurement construction and followed the guidelines
   recommended by Ajzen and Fishbein to ensure construct validity. Data
   were collected on TRA constructs and demographic variables using the
   questionnaire mailed to 278 faculty members targeted for the study. A
   42% (n = 116) response rate was achieved after one round of the
   follow-up through emailing. The significant predictor variables,
   attitude and subjective social norm were confirmed. In other words,
   results of analyses evidenced the contribution of TRA to explaining the
   underlying beliefs that enhance or thwart participation. Additionally,
   faculty in this study possessed positive attitudes towards the
   participation in online teaching, and further analyses supported the
   use of TRA in this research context.

TI University teachers' experiences in courseware development
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The professoriate is increasingly expected to infuse computer
   technology in teaching. However, there is dearth of qualitative data to
   either support or disprove this belief. This study thus aims to
   describe the experiences of a select group of college teachers as they
   develop, implement and evaluate their courseware materials. Ten tenured
   faculty members who have developed, deployed and evaluated their
   courseware materials were the participants of this qualitative inquiry.
   Initially, the teachers were made to fill out robotfotos (in Dutch, a
   cartographic sketch) for purposes of profiling their baseline
   characteristics. Data gathered were carefully analysed and thematised
   on the basis of internal and external homogeneity. Guided by a
   semistructured audio-taped interview, this study captured the
   experiences of the teachers whose instructional paradigms were
   facilitated and revolutionised by a learning management system (LMS),
   specifically the Blackboard (Bb) system. Findings show that generally,
   the professoriate considers the courseware materials developed as
   instructional adjuncts that complement their time-tested teaching
   modalities. Having identified an LMS such as Bb as a user-friendly
   system, issues relative to system's accessibility, technical
   difficulties, systemic training programmes for teachers, attractive
   system of incentives and user readiness are key areas that ensure
   overall programme success and viability.

TI Online learner's 'flow' experience: an empirical study
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTIONS; ENVIRONMENTS; MODEL
AB This study is concerned with online learners' 'flow' experiences. On
   the basis of Csikszentmihalyi's theory of flow, flow was conceptualised
   as a complex, multimentional, reflective construct composing of
   'enjoyment', 'telepresence', 'focused attention', 'engagement' and
   'time distortion' on the part of learners. A flow model was put forward
   with regard to virtual class environment in a traditional university
   context, comprised with flow antecedents, flow and flow consequences.
   Based on the model, a virtual-course flow measure was developed and
   administered to 525 undergraduate students engaged in virtual classes
   in order to examine the empirical relationships between measured flow
   antecedents, flow experiences and flow consequence-course satisfaction
   in this case. The analysis of the data showed that: (1) students'
   perceptions of their level of 'skill' and 'challenge' specific to each
   course are critical to determining the level of flow, (2) flow is a
   significant predictor of course satisfaction and (3) other than flow,
   individual differences such as 'gender' and 'having a clear goal' can
   make a significant difference in the level of flow in a virtual course.
   These findings are discussed along with the implications for bringing
   up a computer-mediated environment more conducive to flow and learning.

TI Spelling and grammar checkers: are they intrusive?
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PERFORMANCE; REVISION; TEXT
AB Spelling and grammar checkers help to make surface errors more
   apparent; do they influence the way in which people revise the content
   of their writing? We investigated whether the presence of checkers
   distracts students from making content revisions. Twenty-five freshmen,
   20 English majors and 20 graduate students revised two essays on a
   computer, one with the spelling and grammar checkers, and the other
   with a dictionary. These essays were unfamiliar to the students and
   rigged with content and surface errors. The checkers helped the
   participants to revise text for surface features but did not affect the
   students' other revisions. Our findings suggest that checkers are
   helpful yet do not inhibit students' ability to make content revisions.

TI Orchestrating interdependence in an international online learning
   community
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper focuses on research into the student experience as
   participants in the development of an international online community.
   The background context for this is an international master's programme
   and the specific context for the research is a module on Digital Media
   Applications (DMA), which are outlined. The programme design emphasises
   peer and formative assessment practices and the pedagogical approach
   aims to foster group collaboration in international teams. Following an
   overview of the research methods adopted, a number of emergent themes
   from the data analysis of student diaries are discussed, including
   issues of language, culture and identity. In conclusion, we offer some
   reflections on these issues and discuss the underpinning assumptions
   (in relation to assessment practices in particular) that have given
   direction to our subsequent ongoing research and development.

ID PROJECT-BASED INSTRUCTION; COLLABORATION
AB Past and present research has provided evidence to support the claim
   that technologies for teaching and learning must be pedagogically
   sound. However, educational technologies are also part of a complex
   process involving the people in the implementation of the innovation.
   In this paper, I review existing research and explain what both of
   those claims entail for educational technology. In the remainder of the
   paper, I discuss the research agenda related to the need to provide
   evidence that technology innovations are successful in the
   implementation process. Implications of this three-part model as well
   as a discussion of the importance of technological pedagogical content
   knowledge conclude the paper.

TI Developing a comprehensive metric for assessing discussion board
   effectiveness
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ONLINE; EDUCATION; PARTICIPATION
AB The use of online discussion boards has grown extensively in the past 5
   years, yet some researchers argue that our understanding of how to use
   this tool in an effective and meaningful way is minimal at best. Part
   of the problem in acquiring more cohesive and useful information rests
   in the absence of a comprehensive, theory-driven metric to assess
   quality and effectiveness. Based on an extensive review of the
   research, the following variables were used to assess traditional
   discussion board use: thread, location of message within thread, author
   (student vs. educator), subject line clarity, time of posting, response
   time from previous message, number of times message was read, number of
   words, primary purpose, message quality, difficulty level of topic,
   knowledge level, processing level and use of external resources. These
   variables proved to be effective in assessing 12 key areas of
   discussion board use. It is argued that this kind of metric is
   essential if we wish to advance our understanding of online discussion
   boards for both educators and researchers.

TI Girl gamers: the controversy of girl games and the relevance of
   female-oriented game design for instructional design
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

ID LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS; VIDEO-GAMES; GENDER
AB Digital games have typically been considered a male leisure activity;
   however, recent statistics indicate that increasing numbers of females
   are now playing games. The purpose of this review is to investigate how
   the influx of girl gamers and the emergence of female-oriented game
   design can inform instructional design for the construction of
   interactive learning environments. This review presents an overview of
   digital games and gender, an outline of girl games and 'pink' software,
   a discussion of the controversy of girl games, and a review and
   discussion of the research and implications of female-oriented game
   design for instructional design. The goal of this review is to examine
   the influx of girl gamers into a male pastime and to analyse the
   implications of this for the design of interactive learning
   environments.

TI The tension between authoritative and dialogic discourse: A fundamental
   characteristic of meaning making interactions in high school science

SO SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID CLASSROOM
AB In this paper, we draw upon a framework for analyzing the discursive
   interactions of science classrooms (Mortimer & Scott, 2003, Meaning
   Making in Secondary Science Classrooms, Maidenhead, UK: Open University
   Press), to probe the movement between authoritative and dialogic
   discourse in a Brazilian high school science class. More specifically,
   we argue the point that such shifts between communicative approaches
   are an inevitable part of teaching whose purpose is to support
   meaningful learning of scientific knowledge. We suggest that a
   necessary tension therefore exists between authoritative and dialogic
   approaches as dialogic exchanges are followed by authoritative
   interventions (to develop the canonical scientific view), and the
   authoritative introduction of new ideas is followed by the opportunity
   for dialogic application and exploration of those ideas. In these ways,
   one communicative approach follows from the other, authoritativeness
   acting as a seed for dialogicity and vice versa. We discuss how this
   analysis, in terms of shifts in communicative approach, offers a new
   and complementary perspective on supporting "productive disciplinary
   engagement" (Engle & Conant, 2002, Cognition and Instruction, 20,
   399-484) in the classroom. Finally we consider some methodological
   issues arising from this study. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB It is widely accepted that to be scientifically literate one needs to
   have the ability to make thoughtful decisions about socioscientific
   issues (SSI). This includes critical assessment of scientific claims
   and arguments involved. In this study we asked 89 science education
   students with substantial academic qualifications in science, working
   in groups of two and three, to assess the reliability of scientific
   claims in an article of their own choice, but related to a
   socioscientific issue, and to present their evaluation in a short text.
   In analyzing the students' texts, we focused on the criteria they had
   explicitly and implicitly used in their evaluations. Through a
   qualitative analysis, we identified 13 different criteria focusing on
   empirical and theoretical adequacy, completeness of presented
   information, social aspects, and manipulative strategies. An inspection
   of the students' evaluations revealed that they drew upon knowledge of
   possible institutional interests, different signs of competence and an
   appreciation of concurrent expert views, but also methodological norms
   in science, specialized content knowledge, and an appreciation of
   evidence and disclosure of sources. The number of criteria used and the
   quality of their application varied, indicating that critical
   examination of texts with a science dimension needs to be emphasized in
   science teacher education. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The purpose of this 2-year study was to investigate Malawian teacher
   educators' perspectives and dispositions toward teaching about
   ecological sustainability issues in Malawi, a developing country in
   sub-Sahara Africa. This study was embedded in a larger theoretical
   framework of investigating earth systems science through the
   understanding of nature-knowledge-culture systems from local,
   place-based perspectives. Specifically, we were interested in learning
   more about eco-justice issues that are related to environmental
   degradation in Malawi and the potential role of inquiry-oriented
   pedagogies in addressing these issues. In a science methods course, the
   African educators' views on deforestation and teaching about ecological
   sustainability were explored within the context of the local
   environment and culture. Teachers participated in inquiry pedagogies
   designed to promote the sharing of perspectives related to the
   connections between culture and ecological degradation. Strategies
   encouraging dialogue and reflection included role-playing, class
   discussions, curriculum development activities, teaching experiences
   with children, and field trips to a nature preserve. Data were analyzed
   from postcolonial and critical pedagogy of place theoretical
   perspectives to better understand the hybridization of viewpoints
   influenced by both Western and indigenous science and the political
   hegemonies that impact sustainable living in Malawi. Findings suggested
   that the colonial legacy of Malawi continues to impact the ecological
   sustainability issue of deforestation. Inquiry-oriented pedagogies and
   connections to indigenous science were embraced by the Malawian
   educators as a means to involve children in investigation, decision
   making, and ownership of critical environmental issues. (c) 2006 Wiley

AB The scarce attention to the assessment and evaluation in science
   education research has been especially harmful for teaching
   science-technology-society (STS) issues, due to the dialectical,
   tentative, value-laden, and polemic nature of most STS topics. This
   paper tackles the methodological difficulties of the instruments that
   monitor views related to STS topics and rationalizes a quantitative
   methodology and an analysis technique to improve the utility of an
   empirically developed multiple-choice item pool, the Questionnaire of
   Opinions on STS. This methodology embraces an item-scaling
   psychometrics based on the judgments by a panel of experts, a multiple
   response model, a scoring system, and the data analysis. The
   methodology finally produces normalized attitudinal indices that
   represent the respondent's reasoned beliefs toward STS statements, the
   respondent's position on an item that comprises several statements, or
   the respondent's position on an entire STS topic that encompasses a set
   of items. Some preliminary results show the methodology's ability to
   evaluate the STS attitudes in a qualitative and quantitative way and
   for statistical hypothesis testing. Lastly, some applications for
   teacher training and STS curriculum development in science classrooms
   are discussed. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The process of construction of meanings for the concepts of
   concentration and neutralization is explored in terms of
   contextualizing practices (Lemke, 1990, Talking Science. Language,
   Learning and Values, Norwood, NJ: Ablex) creation of meanings through
   connections established among actions and their context. This notion is
   expanded to include the connections established among concepts and
   their context of use, a solving problem task in a laboratory. The
   purpose is to document the process of meaning construction for these
   concepts and their transformation from mere terms into decisions and
   practical actions in a chemistry laboratory. We sought to combine this
   analysis with an epistemological focus, examining the relative
   epistemic status of the contextualizing practices. The conversations
   and actions of four grade 10 students and their teacher (second author)
   were recorded while solving an open task: to find the concentration of
   an HCl solution. The results show a progression in the process of
   contextualization, from an initial inability to use the concepts as
   part of the resources to complete the titration task, to the
   transformation of definitions into shared meaningful concepts that
   allow to take actions, combining theoretical resources with physical
   ones to solve the problem. A frame for categorizing contextualizing
   practices across epistemic levels is proposed and applied to the data.

DT Article
AB Partnerships of teachers with scientists are thought to be important
   for many aspects of science education reform, but it is not always
   clear how to make such partnerships productive. Between 1994 and 1997,
   high school teachers were partnered with scientists, to design yearlong
   ecological research projects in which the teachers were learning for
   their own sake, rather than to create new curriculum. In these
   partnerships the relationships with the scientists took many forms. We
   found that negotiations around five dimensions seemed particularly
   important: (1) Whose question was being investigated? (2) Was the focus
   primarily on data collection or data analysis? (3) Was the research
   based on the ecologist's area of expertise, or the teachers' interest?
   (4) Was the focus primarily on the teachers' learning on their
   students' classroom learning? (5) Was the research intended for an
   external audience, or primarily for the teachers' own benefit? Three
   case studies are presented, showing how these dimensions shaped the
   negotiations of more successful and less successful collaborations.
   Implications for inquiry-based pedagogy, and cultural issues arising in
   scientist-teacher collaborations, are discussed. (c) 2006 Wiley

AB Given that the subject department is recognised by subject specialist
   teachers as the central and immediate unit of organization in secondary
   schools it is surprising that so little attention has been paid by
   researchers to the leadership dynamics within science departments. The
   leadership dynamics within the science departments of two contrasting
   school contexts were explored dialectically in this study. The
   structure vertical bar agency and individual vertical bar collective
   dialectics guided our interpretation of data from lesson observations,
   interviews and questionnaire responses, especially as they related to
   teachers' preparation of units of work (i.e., planned curriculum). As
   well as recognising thin coherence in teachers' responses we identify
   contradictions in teachers' perceived and enacted leadership roles, and
   perceptions of influences on curriculum planning and teaming within the
   two science departments. Throughout the article we disrupt traditional
   individualistic leadership discourses and suggest possibilities for
   more widespread application of an individual vertical bar collective
   leadership dialectic in school science departments.

TI University students' strategies for constructing hypothesis when
   tackling paper-and-pencil tasks in physics
SO RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English

DE constructing hypothesis; physics problem solving; student learning
ID SCIENCE
AB The study we present tries to explore how first year engineering
   students formulate hypotheses in order to construct their own problem
   solving structure when confronted with problems in physics. Under the
   constructivistic perspective of the teaching-learning process, the
   formulation of hypotheses plays a key role in contrasting the coherence
   of the students' ideas with the theoretical frame. The main research
   instrument used to identify students' reasoning is the written report
   by the student on how they have attempted four problem solving tasks in
   which they have been asked explicitly to formulate hypotheses. The
   protocols used in the assessment of the solutions consisted of a
   semi-quantitative study based on grids designed for the analysis of
   written answers. In this paper we have included two of the tasks used
   and the corresponding scheme for the categorisation of the answers.
   Details of the other two tasks are also outlined. According to our
   findings we would say that the majority of students judge a hypothesis
   to be plausible if it is congruent with their previous knowledge
   without rigorously checking it against the theoretical framework
   explained in class.

AB This paper explores the different types and characteristics of
   preschool children's explanations of plant growth and rain formation.
   The children's explanations were categorized as naturalistic,
   non-naturalistic, or synthetic, i.e., explanations containing both
   naturalistic and non-naturalistic parts. In regards to plant growth the
   children tended to rely on synthetic or on naturalistic explanations,
   which involved direct and indirect agents (such as water, a person,
   fertilizers, roots) enabling the plant to grow. Non-naturalistic
   explanations of plant growth, or the non-naturalistic parts of
   synthetic explanations, were mainly animistic (anthropomorphic). In the
   case of rain formation the children most frequently used
   non-naturalistic explanations, which were mainly teleological or
   metaphysical. The naturalistic explanations recorded on rain formation,
   as well as the naturalistic parts of synthetic explanations tended to
   have a non-agentive character, i.e., children considered rainwater as
   preexisting in containers such as the clouds. Overall, the explanations
   recorded about plant growth tended to be more complex than the ones for
   rain formation. It is suggested that science activities designed for
   preschool children should take into account the types and
   characteristics of their explanations in order to select which
   phenomena are appropriate for this age group, and aim at fostering the
   children's ability at formulating naturalistic explanations.

AB u This study examined the features of peer argumentation in middle
   school students' scientific inquiry. Participants were two boys and six
   girls in grade 8 of a middle school in Seoul, Korea. Students engaged
   in open inquiry activities in small groups. Each group prepared the
   report for peer review and then, during the peer discussion, presented
   their inquiry results while another group acted as critics, in a way
   similar to conference presentations by scientists. This study's data
   sources included audio- and video-tapes of discussions, copies of
   student reports, questionnaires completed by the students and
   transcripts of interviews with the students. It was found that the
   critical peer discussion in general proceeded through the following
   four stages: Focusing, Exchanging, Debating and Closing. In addition,
   75.6% of evidence used in students' arguments was personal evidence and
   students used various cognitive and social strategies in the critical
   discussion. For an effective critical discussion, making good use of
   the Focusing Stage was found to be important factor. Students improved
   their interpretation and methods of experiment during the argumentation
   process and this feedback made the inquiry circular. Finally, we
   identify a model of argumentative scientific inquiry as an open inquiry
   that has the key components of authentic scientific inquiry.

AB This paper addresses the question of how to develop prospective
   teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) in science teacher
   education. The main focus is on the knowledge transformation process
   and on the cognitive strategies used to shift prospective teachers'
   explanations within the domain of modelling thermal physical phenomena.
   This study investigates the development of PCK within a group of 28
   pre-service physics teachers during the first semester of their
   two-year post-graduate teacher education program. It focuses on the
   central issue of the relationships between observable phenomena, like
   macroscopic thermal properties of matter and their interpretation
   and/or explanation in terms of corpuscular characteristics and/or
   thermodynamics theory. The strategy is based on the consideration that
   knowledge transformation is not a one-way process from subject matter
   knowledge to pedagogical content knowledge, as literature suggests, but
   a bidirectional process involving deepening of subject matter knowledge
   and increasing awareness of pedagogical issues.

AB Difficulties in students' understanding of the spherical model of the
   Earth have been shown in previous studies. One of the reasons for these
   difficulties lies in beliefs and preliminary knowledge that hinder the
   interpretation of the scientific knowledge, the other reason may lie in
   the low level of verbal and visuo-spatial abilities. The study aims to
   investigate the effect of verbal and visuo-spatial abilities, but also
   that of preliminary knowledge on the later development of the knowledge
   of the Earth in school. 176 schoolchildren (96 boys and 80 girls) from
   five schools were tested; the mean age of the children during the first
   interview was seven years and eight months. All students were
   interviewed twice - in grades 1 and 2, before and after they had learnt
   the topic in school. Factual, scientific and synthetic knowledge was
   assessed. The facilitative effect of visuo-spatial and verbal abilities
   and preliminary factual and scientific knowledge on students' knowledge
   of astronomy after having learnt the topic in school was shown. In
   contrast, the hindering effect of synthetic knowledge was not found.

AB This paper reports and discusses the principal findings of an
   Australian study exploring the decisions of high achieving Year 10
   students about taking physics and chemistry courses (Lyons, 2003). The
   study used a 'multiple worlds' framework to explore the diverse
   background characteristics that previous quantitative research had
   shown were implicated in these decisions. Based on analyses of
   questionnaire and interview data, the study found that the students'
   decisions involved the complex negotiation of a number of cultural
   characteristics within their school science and family worlds. Many of
   the students regarded junior high school science as irrelevant,
   uninteresting and difficult, leaving them with few intrinsic reasons
   for enrolling in senior science courses. The study found that decisions
   about taking physical science courses were associated with the
   resources of cultural and social capital within their families, and the
   degree to which these resources were congruent with the advantages of
   choosing these courses. The paper concludes that the low intrinsic
   value of school science and the erosion of its strategic value
   contribute to the reluctance of students to choose physical science
   courses in the senior school.

TI Teachers' adequacy of subject knowledge in primary science: Assessing
   constructivist approaches from a sociocultural perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CONCEPTIONS; ENERGY; FORCE
AB In recent years, increasing emphasis has come to be placed, both by
   researchers and by policy-makers, on the adequacy of primary teachers'
   subject knowledge of science. Within research, this emphasis has been
   linked to the rise of constructivist ideas about the significance of
   establishing children's prior conceptions of scientific concepts for
   effective teaching. In this article I examine two constructivist
   approaches to teachers' adequacy of subject knowledge within UK
   research on primary science education. In each case I provide a
   critique of the assumptions they make about the nature of knowledge and
   how it develops. I do this from a sociocultural perspective, which
   views knowledge and learning as necessarily situated within communities
   of practice. My aim is to assess the implications of this perspective
   for understanding teachers' adequacy of subject knowledge.

AB Although many research studies report students' Lamarckian
   misconceptions, only a few studies present learning and teaching
   strategies that focus on the successful development of the concept of
   natural selection. The learning and teaching strategy for upper
   secondary students (aged 15 - 16) presented in this study conducted in
   The Netherlands is based on the idea of guided reinvention, rather than
   on the conceptual change strategy. In guided reinvention, students
   reinvent the concept of natural selection by answering a sequence of
   questions based on the logical nature of Darwin's theory. The results
   show that few Lamarckian explanations for evolution were recorded in
   the study and that the majority of the students developed a Darwinian
   or neo-Darwinian conception. The status of Lamarckian misconceptions is
   challenged.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MUSEUM; PERSPECTIVES; KNOWLEDGE
AB This paper synthesizes findings from three studies to answer a general
   question: What do casual, adult visitors learn about science from their
   science-related experiences in free-choice settings? Specifically we
   asked whether there are changes in how people think about science in
   their daily lives, the nature and use of scientific knowledge, and its
   communication by scientists. The three studies involved samples of
   visitors to an interactive science centre, visitors to a traditional
   natural history museum, and attendees at a series of public lectures,
   each given by an expert scientist in human genetics. Pretest and
   post-test data collected by parallel questionnaires indicated that,
   despite the different nature of their experience in the three different
   settings, participants became more positive about the value of science
   and the work done by scientists and their ability to communicate with
   the public. At all venues, however, participants became less scientific
   in their thinking about the nature of scientific knowledge, becoming
   more likely to believe it to be infallible. The consistency of these
   findings was surprising, and participants' changed views about the
   nature of scientific knowledge were unexpected. Possible explanations
   for theses outcomes were suggested in terms of participants' reasons
   for attending the venue, the nature of their engagement, and the
   non-controversial ways in which the exhibitions and lectures were
   structured. The findings suggest that the educational role of
   free-choice settings should be considered carefully, particularly with
   regard to the representation of science.

AB In this study, the responses of teachers and their pupils to the
   educational programme "Nature on the Way to School" were investigated
   with the help of questionnaires. The main objectives of the programme
   were the promotion of opportunities for children to experience nature
   first-hand on the way to school, the promotion of children's awareness
   of nature in their daily lives, and the promotion of interest in and
   tolerance of local plants and animals. More than 3000 children (8 - 16
   years old) from 166 primary and secondary school classes in Switzerland
   and 117 teachers participated in the study. Children of all age groups
   particularly enjoyed observing nature directly. Teachers gave the
   programme very high ratings on average. The ratings given by the
   teachers and the learning gains of the pupils were positively related.
   Teachers from rural and urban areas carried out similar activities
   during the programme and regarded the programme as a success. The high
   satisfaction of both pupils and their teachers with the programme
   supports the thesis that teachers should make more use of educational
   approaches focusing on direct experiences in the local environment of
   children.

DT Article
ID CONCEPTIONS; PHILOSOPHY; KNOWLEDGE; STUDENTS; VIEWS
AB This paper reports the relationship between four English primary
   teachers' understanding of the nature of science and their practice.
   Action research was included as a major part of the research design in
   order to explore the dialectical interplay between various factors at
   work in the teachers' practice. The influences of both tacit and
   espoused understandings of the nature of science were considered
   alongside the teachers' beliefs about education, teaching, and
   learning. These beliefs were found to be the determining factor in the
   teachers' decisions about classroom strategies. In arguing for a
   dialectical perspective on teachers' practice, the research suggests
   that teachers' espoused understanding of the nature of science may also
   be at least partially formed by the influence of these beliefs, raising
   the possibility that influence may run from teaching to theoretical
   understanding and not the other way round.

AB This study explored teachers' pedagogical strategies for using
   multimedia simulation to structure and support secondary science
   teaching. Expertise was investigated across a range of classroom
   settings to analyse how specialist knowledge is situated within and
   adapted to the teaching and learning context. Analysis of data arising
   from 10 lesson observations and post-lesson interviews with five
   teachers and their pupils highlighted significant variation in
   pedagogical approaches shaping simulation use in three topic areas. Two
   contrasting case studies involving a "terminal velocity" simulation
   exemplify this: one was characterized by some "dialogic" whole class
   interaction and collaborative testing of pupils' own ideas; the other
   by a more typical, more authoritative, discourse with pupil pairs.
   Over-structuring of tasks and curricular constraints meant that the
   rhetoric in the literature and teachers' aspirations concerning pupil
   experimentation balanced with structured tasks were not borne out.
   Implications for mode of use and the design of technology-integrated
   activity are discussed.

TI Sound stuff? Naive materialism in middle-school students' conceptions
   of sound
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PHYSICS; CONCEPTUALIZATIONS
AB Few studies have dealt with students' preconceptions of sounds. The
   current research employs Reiner et al. ( 2000) substance schema to
   reveal new insights about students' difficulties in understanding this
   fundamental topic. It aims not only to detect whether the substance
   schema is present in middle school students' thinking, but also
   examines how students use the schema's properties. It asks, moreover,
   whether the substance schema properties are used as islands of local
   consistency or whether one can identify more global coherent
   consistencies among the properties that the students use to explain the
   sound phenomena. In-depth standardized open-ended interviews were
   conducted with ten middle school students. Consistent with the
   substance schema, sound was perceived by our participants as being
   pushable, frictional, containable, or transitional. However, sound was
   also viewed as a substance different from the ordinary with respect to
   its stability, corpuscular nature, additive properties, and inertial
   characteristics. In other words, students' conceptions of sound do not
   seem to fit Reiner et al.'s schema in all respects. Our results also
   indicate that students' conceptualization of sound lack internal
   consistency. Analyzing our results with respect to local and global
   coherence, we found students' conception of sound is close to diSessa's
   "loosely connected, fragmented collection of ideas." The notion that
   sound is perceived only as a "sort of a material," we believe, requires
   some revision of the substance schema as it applies to sound. The
   article closes with a discussion concerning the implications of the
   results for instruction.

AB The article presents some of the results of the questionnaire-based
   Relevance of Science Education Project carried out in England in the
   latter half of 2003 as part of a wider international comparative study
   based at the University of Oslo. Data, drawn from 1,277 students, most
   of them 14 or 15 years old, indicate their attitudes towards a series
   of environmental challenges. The study is presented as a contribution
   to the literature relating to environmental education and to the
   "student voice". The findings reveal significant gender differences in
   attitudes towards the environment and in the responses that students
   seem to be willing to make to address environmental concerns.

AB Cognitive Acceleration through Science Education (CASE) is an
   intervention programme conducted during Years 7 and 8 in the United
   Kingdom (aged 11-13 years), which has reported remarkable success in
   enhancing cognitive development and in raising academic achievement.
   Critics, however, have questioned whether a purely cognitive mechanism
   can explain the differential cognitive gains made by participants. One
   suggestion is that differences in motivational style might provide an
   explanation. This paper will present findings from a longitudinal study
   that addresses this matter. Utilising a goal theory approach to
   motivation, the motivational orientation, related beliefs, and
   self-concepts of approximately 1600 secondary students attending nine
   schools, five of whom were delivering the CASE intervention, were
   assessed before and at the end of the programme. Analyses of these data
   suggested that students exhibit six different motivational styles or
   world-views. These will be characterised. Change in motivation can be
   gauged by examining changes in world-view over the time-span of the
   research (the first 2 years of secondary schooling). Differences in the
   change of motivation of students for students attending CASE and
   control schools will be inspected. Finally, the relationship between
   motivation and cognitive gain, which turns out to be complex, will be
   presented. The implications of these findings, including whether
   world-view can explain differential cognitive acceleration effects,
   will be discussed.

AB We propose a computer-assisted cancellation test system (CACTS) to
   understand the visual attention performance and visual search
   strategies in school children. The main aim of this paper is to present
   our design and development of the CACTS and demonstrate some ways in
   which computer techniques can allow the educator not only to obtain
   more detailed information of visual search strategies but also to
   identify the problems of visual attention in school children. We have
   built a system that utilizes a graphic tablet connected to a PC to
   monitor the trace of visual search paths as well as the accuracy of
   visual search responses in school children during the test
   administration. The preliminary results show that there were no
   significant difference in correctness between sex, test layouts, and
   search patterns, except for the performance on different test forms
   (symbol vs. Chinese radical). The related factors that affect visual
   search behavior are also discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

ID RETELLING STORIES
AB Storytelling is a practical and powerful teaching tool, especially for
   language learning. Teachers in language classrooms, however, may
   hesitate to incorporate storytelling into language instruction because
   of an already overloaded curriculum. English foreign language (EFL)
   teachers in Taiwan report additional problems such as having little
   prior experience with integrating storytelling into language teaching,
   locating appropriate stories, and lacking the cultural and language
   abilities to handle storytelling in English. On the other hand,
   researchers have demonstrated successful usages of computer and
   network-assisted English learning. The researchers in this study have
   developed a multimedia Storytelling Website to study how web-based
   technology can assist overcoming the obstacles mentioned above. The
   website contains an accounts administration module, multimedia story
   composing module, and story re-playing module. In order to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of this Website in significantly facilitating
   teacher's storytelling and children's story recall processes in EFL
   classrooms, it was implemented in one elementary school to test its
   effectiveness in instruction and in resultant student learning. The
   results of the study support the significance and the education value
   of the multimedia Storytelling Website on EFL teaching and learning. If
   such a Website can be applied within elementary EFL classrooms, the
   quality of teaching and learning can be improved and students'
   enjoyment and success in EFL learning may increase. (c) 2004 Elsevier

AB We report on the use of email lists as a supplement to teaching. We
   argue that email lists can provide a valuable students-instructor
   communication channel and describe the process of setting up and
   managing such lists. A case study of email messages exchanged in an
   introductory operations research course is also included. The case
   illustrates how a 'strategic' use of email leads to a richer learning
   experience, by providing an extra medium for communication, and offers
   a valuable feedback database that can, among other things, be used to
   improve future editions of a course. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This study assessed the effectiveness of using a CALL lesson (Computer
   Assisted Language Learning) over a conventional lesson to facilitate
   learning of English prepositions at Bario, Malaysia. CALL was developed
   by the Ministry of Education, Malaysia as support material to enhance
   learning of English prepositions. Both the conventional and the CALL
   lessons were matched with the same content except for the medium in
   which the lesson was being delivered. Students were provided with
   computers to go through the CALL lesson in a self-regulated manner;
   while a teacher taught the conventional lesson in a classroom. Test
   results indicate that students who received the conventional - lesson
   outperformed those who went through the CALL lesson. The Relative
   Condition Efficiency measurement also showed that the conventional
   group learned more efficiently than the CALL group. The findings are
   interpreted from the perspective of cognitive load required in
   processing the presentation mode of the learning materials. (c) 2004

AB This article reports on the design, implementation and evaluation of a
   module in the MEd (Business) in the Faculty of Education at the
   University of Hong Kong in which an explicit problem-based learning
   (PBL) approach was used to investigate the challenges associated with
   the adoption and use of information and communication technologies
   (ICT) in Hong Kong secondary school classrooms. PBL influenced both the
   way the curriculum was developed and the process by which students (n =
   18) investigated topics related to the integration of ICT in business
   studies classrooms. The evaluation was based on five evaluative
   questions dealing with the implementation of PBL, the extent to which
   PBL facilitated academic discourse, the extent of 'new' knowledge about
   ICT that had been created, the role of the tutor, and the online
   learning environment provided. The evaluation revealed that PBL
   provided a practical approach to investigating ICT in both face-to-face
   and online learning environments, leading to 'new' knowledge about
   challenges associated with the adoption and use of new technologies in
   various educational settings. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The effects that media can have on task performance have been greatly
   debated over the years. Whilst agreement has begun to emerge on the
   effects media have on cognitive performance, little is understood about
   the relationship between such media effects and individual differences
   such as individuals who have dyslexia. This paper presents findings
   from a study that investigated the effects computer-based media can
   have on the learning outcomes of individuals who have dyslexia. The
   purpose of the study was to obtain data that informed the development
   and design of e-learning and distance learning materials for universal
   use. The research process was based on Dual Coding Theory and refined
   by current theories on dyslexia. Findings from the research are
   intended to help academics and providers of e-learning materials to
   improve the design and delivery of their learning contents. (c) 2004

AB This paper describes a dynamic computer-based business learning
   environment and the results from applying it in a real-world business
   organization. We argue for using learning tools, which not only provide
   realistic and complex models of reality, but are also are authentic,
   facilitate continuous problem solving and meaningful learning, and
   embed learning in social experience. We describe a continuously
   processed business simulation game, which differs from the majority of
   business games in the way it is processed. Two company in-house
   training sessions are then introduced. In these sessions the learning
   environment was configured to describe the real-world environment of
   the case company. The empirical part of the paper analyses the findings
   from these in-house training sessions. We conclude that dynamicity and
   interactivity of the business learning tool are valuable
   characteristics if we want to be able to authentically represent the
   complex, causal, time-bound nature of business organizations. (c) 2004

   instructional technology, students enrolled in several courses were
   compared on student evaluations of instruction, grades and an
   attitudinal questionnaire. The instructors of the courses taught the
   same course across two successive semesters, using traditional
   "chalk-and-talk" methods the first semester, and PowerPoint the next;
   all other techniques (e.g., exams, lecture material) were held
   constant. Results suggest that organization and clarity, entertainment

AB The purpose of this study was to determine whether providing students
   with continuous written instructional support or fading written
   instructional support (scaffolds) better prepares students to construct
   scientific explanations when they are no longer provided with support.
   This article investigated the influence of scaffolding on 331
   seventh-grade students' writing of scientific explanations during an
   8-week, project-based chemistry unit in which the construction of
   scientific explanations is a key learning goal. The unit makes an
   instructional model for explanation explicit to students through a
   focal lesson and reinforces that model through subsequent written
   support for each investigation. Students received 1 of 2 treatments in
   terms of the type of written support: continuous, involving detailed
   support for every investigation, or faded, involving less support over
   time. The analyses showed significant learning gains for students for
   all components of scientific explanation (i.e., claim, evidence, and
   reasoning). However, on posttest items lacking scaffolds, the faded
   group gave stronger explanations in terms of their reasoning compared
   to the continuous group. Fading written scaffolds better equipped
   students to write explanations when they were not provided with support.

ID DESIGN-BASED RESEARCH
AB The purpose of this article is to identify some necessary conditions of
   learning. To learn something, the learner must discern what is to be
   learned (the object of learning). Discerning the object of learning
   amounts to discerning its critical aspects. To discern an aspect, the
   learner must experience potential alternatives, that is, variation in a
   dimension corresponding to that aspect, against the background of
   invariance in other aspects of the same object of learning. (One could
   not discern the color of things, for instance, if there was only one
   color.) The study results illustrate that what students learn in a
   sequence of lessons is indeed a function of the pattern of variation
   and invariance constituted in that sequence. All teachers make use of
   variation and invariance in their teaching, but this study shows that
   teachers informed by a systematic framework do it more systematically,
   with striking effects on their students' learning.

   SCIENCE INSTRUCTION; TOY MODEL; BELIEFS; KNOWLEDGE; VIEWS;
   COMPREHENSION; RESOURCES
AB Research on personal epistemologies (Hofer & Pintrich, 2002) has mostly
   conceptualized them as stable beliefs or stages of development. On
   these views, researchers characterize individual students'
   epistemologies with single, coherent descriptions. Evidence of
   variability in Student epistemologies, however, suggests the need for
   more complex models. Hammer and Elby (2002) proposed modeling personal
   epistemologies as comprised of manifold epistemological resources.
   This difference in ontology-the form research attributes to cognitive
   structure-accounts for variability: The activation of these
   epistemological resources depends on context. Our purpose in this
   article is to argue that it also accounts for coherences in student
   epistemologies, in particular for multiple local coherences. We advance
   this argument using a case study of a 15-min discussion by a group of
   eighth graders about the "rock cycle" (the cyclic transformations of
   rock among different forms). We begin with evidence of the students'
   working from a stable, coherent epistemological stance. Then, after a
   brief, purely epistemological intervention by the teacher, the evidence
   indicates they are working from a different but also coherent and
   stable epistemological stance.

AB In this study, we explore the competencies required for a project
   manager to be effective in the workplace. We used a Web-based Delphi
   method to lead experienced project managers through an anonymous
   consensus-building process consisting of two rounds of surveys. The
   Round I analysis of 147 respondents, all with 20 or more Years of
   project management experience, yielded 117 project management success
   factors, 78 of which were identified as trainable competencies. The
   Round II analysis confirmed 42 of the 78 competencies (53.8%) as very
   important to extremely important to project manager success. Important
   contributions of this study include: (a) reporting on project manager
   competencies that can inform the literature and guide the development
   of educational programs for instructional designers and other
   professionals, and (b) demonstrating the Web-based Delphi technique to
   be an efficient methodology for conducting a front-end analysis, a core
   process of instructional design (ID) work.

AB The field of instructional design has traditionally treated concepts as
   discrete learning outcomes. Theoretically, learning concepts requires
   correctly isolating and applying attributes of specific objects into
   their correct categories. Similarity views of concept learning are
   unable to account for all of the rules governing concept formation,
   patterns Of concepts, and concepts-in-use. Probabilistic-prototype and
   exemplar views have accommodated some of the inherent fuzziness of
   concepts. Concepts can only be fully understood as processes of
   conceptual change, the reorganization of conceptual frameworks.
   Although very little research has focused on assessing conceptual
   change, the theories of conceptual change recommend assessing patterns
   of concepts and concepts-in-use. Descriptions of pertinent assessment
   methods are presented.

AB This study was designed to examine the effects of the competency (low
   vs. high) and interaction type (proactive vs. responsive) of
   pedagogical agents as learning companions (PALs) on learning,
   self-efficacy, and attitudes. Participants were 72 undergraduates in an
   introductory computer-literacy course who were randomly assigned to one
   of four treatments: Low-Proactive, Low-Responsive, High-Proactive, and
   High-Responsive. Results indicated a main effect for PAL competency.
   Students who worked with the high-competency PAL in both proactive and
   responsive conditions achieved higher scores in applying what they had
   learned and showed more positive attitudes toward the PAL. However,
   students who worked with the low-competency PAL reported significantly
   enhanced self-efficacy beliefs in the learning tasks. Also, there was a
   main effect for PAL interaction type. A proactive PAL had a
   significantly positive impact on recall. These different results on
   learning and motivational outcomes suggest that the competency and
   interaction type of a PAL should be designed according to the desired
   learning and motivational goals.

AB The purpose of this conceptual analysis is to investigate how
   contemporary video and computer games might inform instructional design
   by looking at how narrative devices and techniques support problem
   solving within complex, multimodal environments. Specifically, this
   analysis presents a brief overview of game genres and the role of
   narrative in popular adventure game design, along with an analysis of
   how narrative supports problem solving in adventure games.
   Additionally, an analysis of the underlying structure used in game
   design for developing narratives is presented along with design
   heuristics for constructing narratives for educational purposes.

DE instructional design; visual language; conceptual language; notation
   system; design communication
AB The last decade has brought about a major change in higher education.
   Course design has developed from a craftsmanship-like process to a
   structured production, which involves interdisciplinary teams and
   requires more complex communication skills. This conceptual article
   introduces (EML)-M-2-Educational Environment Modeling Language-a visual
   language for supporting complex instructional design processes.
   (EML)-M-2 can be used for visualizing the intermediate and final
   results of design, thus providing documentation in a shared language
   that can enhance team communication, improve design, and contribute to
   the development of high-quality instruction. The language and its
   formal features are presented from a conceptual point of view and
   illustrated by examples. The main results of a first evaluation study
   are reported, and the exploitation of (EML)-M-2 in practice as well as
   its costs and benefits are critically discussed.

AB This study investigated teacher-child interaction within small-group
   science activities ill a fourth-grade classroom. This qualitative study
   revealed three "zones of interaction," or teacher-child interaction
   categories: Individual Zones of Interaction, Multiple Zones of
   Interaction. and a Collective Zone of Interaction. Each zone was
   further shaped by either a procedural, conceptual, or managerial focus
   for the interaction. These zones granted children differential levels
   of access to the teacher's knowledge. Based on these data and findings,
   we propose a discourse model for elementary science classrooms that
   encompasses talk. materials, knowledge, engagement, and power. (c) 2006

TI Fifth graders' science inquiry abilities: A comparative study of

ID PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS; SAMPLING VARIABILITY
AB A large number of American elementary school students are now studying
   science using the hands-on inquiry curricula developed in the 1990s:
   Insights; Full Option Science System (FOSS): and Science and Technology
   for Children (STC). A goal of these programs, echoed in the National
   Science Education Standards, is that children should gain "abilities to
   do scientific inquiry" and "Understanding about scientific inquiry." We
   have studied the degree to which students can do inquiries by using
   four hands-on performance assessments, which required one or three
   class periods. To he lair, the assessments avoided content that is
   studied in depth in the hands-on programs. For a sample of about 1000
   fifth grade students, we compared the performance of students in
   hands-on curricula with an equal number Of Students with textbook
   curricula. The students were from 41 classrooms in nine school
   districts. The results show little or no curricular effect. There was a
   strong dependence on Students' cognitive ability, as Measured with a
   standard multiple-choice instrument. There was no significant
   difference between boys and girls. Also, there was no difference on a
   multiple-choice test, which used items released from the Trends in
   International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). It is not
   completely clear whether the lack of difference on the performance
   assessments was a consequence of the assessments, the curricula, and/or
   the teaching. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The purpose of this Study was to investigate the degree to which A.
   Bandura's (1997) hypothesized sources of self-efficacy predict the
   science self-efficacy beliefs of middle school Students (N = 319), to
   replicate previous findings that science self-efficacy predicts science
   achievement, and to explore how science self-efficacy and its
   antecedents differ by gender. Significant correlations were found
   between mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, social persuasions,
   physiological arousal, and self-efficacy. Only mastery experiences
   significantly predicted science self-efficacy. Girls reported stronger
   science self-efficacy than did boys, Findings support and extend the
   theoretical tenets of Bandura's social cognitive theory. (c) 2006 Wiley

AB Our main goal in this study was to explore whether the use of models in
   molecular genetics instruction in high school can contribute to
   students' understanding of concepts and processes in genetics. Three
   comparable groups of 11th and 12th graders participated: The control
   group (116 students) was taught in the traditional lecture format,
   while the others received instructions which integrated a bead model
   (71 students), or an illustration model (71 students). Similar
   instructions and the same guiding questions accompanied the two models.
   We used three instruments: a multiple-choice and an open-ended written
   questionnaire, as well as personal interviews. Five of the
   multiple-choice questions were also given to students before receiving
   their genetics instruction (pretest). We found that students who used
   one of the two types of models improved their knowledge in molecular
   genetics compared to the control group. However, the open-ended
   questions revealed that bead model activity was significantly more
   effective than illustration activity. On the basis of these findings we
   conclude that, though it is advisable to use a three-dimensional model,
   such as the bead model, engaging students in activities with
   illustrations can still improve their achievement in comparison to
   traditional instruction. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Does the modality of instructional messages affect learning? How does
   it affect different media? In this paper, I offer an answer to these
   questions by first proposing a theoretical framework from which
   effective instructional methods can be derived. Then, I report a set of
   studies where one method, the modality principle, was tested across
   different media and found to produce significant learning benefits.
   Based on the findings and those of a recent meta-analysis of modality
   effects, I suggest future research directions to examine method and
   media contributions to learning.

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE community of practice; dialogue; discourse analysis; networked
   learning; non-traditional learners
AB This paper analyses a sample of online discussions to evaluate the
   development of adult learners as reflective practitioners within a
   networked learning community. The context for our study is a blended
   learning course offering post-experience professional training to
   non-traditional university students. These students are parents and
   carers of people with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). We use Lave and
   Wenger's 'communities of practice' as a theoretical framework for
   establishing how students develop a learning community based upon
   mutual engagement, joint enterprise and shared repertoires. Those three
   aspects are analysed according to two measures. The first focuses on
   learner appropriation of the professional discourse, values and goals
   of the ASD carer through the network. The second relates to changes in
   the quality of collaborative activity over time. Our analysis
   demonstrates that students belong to an overarching community of
   practice, with different subsets who work at sharing and
   co-constructing common understandings. This shared discourse and common
   notions of what constitutes good practice help create a safe
   interaction space for the students. Once group identity is
   consolidated, more challenging questions emerge and the group are able
   to define further common values, understandings and goals through
   processes of resolution.

AB The development of Internet technologies has the ability to provide a
   new era of easily accessible and personalised learning, facilitated
   through the flexible deployment of small, reusable pieces of digital
   learning content over networks. Higher education institutions can share
   and reuse digital learning resources in order to improve their
   educational offerings. Descriptive language (known as metadata) is
   required to facilitate the search and retrieval of learning content.
   Various research offerings have been proposed to promote interoperable
   educational metadata. However, current metadata standards cannot
   accommodate the requirements of every community of users. This paper
   describes the development of an educational metadata application

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING

DT Article
DE distance learning; e-learning; faculty members training; ICT use;
   technology-enhanced learning; university teaching
AB Technology-enhanced learning (TEL) methodologies are becoming an
   important part of University teaching but faculty members have tended
   to shy away from using them. So, how can they be enticed to use them
   effectively? What approaches can be used? The purpose of the Xanadu
   project was to analyse the problems involved and to propose a model for
   training, based on experimentation at the University of Turin. Besides
   providing a model, this article will deal with the follow-up,
   particularly regarding the faculty members' initial approach to using
   information and communication technology (ICT), as well as examine the
   motives and conditions influencing their choices. In this sense, the
   project has enabled us to come to a better understanding of the typical
   misconceptions leading teachers to favour methodological approaches
   based on the distributive use of ICT (which are considered less
   demanding to manage), rather than networked collaborative interaction,
   which actually involve students more. In this regard, Xanadu has shown
   how teachers' awareness may be developed towards adopting a wide range
   of TEL approaches through both gradual training (project-oriented with
   a basic and an advanced course) and with the help of a graduate
   assistant capable of following e-content development and online
   collaborative activities. The effectiveness of the method may be
   confirmed by the large number of faculty members continuing to use ICT
   to support their teaching despite having no specific university TEL
   projects.

DE learning styles; neural networks; Web-based instruction
ID MODEL
AB People have unique ways of learning, which may greatly affect the
   learning process and, therefore, its outcome. In order to be effective,
   e-learning systems should be capable of adapting the content of courses
   to the individual characteristics of students. In this regard, some
   educational systems have proposed the use of questionnaires for
   determining a student learning style; and then adapting their behaviour
   according to the students' styles. However, the use of questionnaires
   is shown to be not only a time-consuming investment but also an
   unreliable method for acquiring learning style characterisations. In
   this paper, we present an approach to recognize automatically the
   learning styles of individual students according to the actions that he
   or she has performed in an e-learning environment. This recognition
   technique is based upon feed-forward neural networks.

ID EFFICACY
AB The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of
   formative assessment and learning style on student achievement in a
   Web-based learning environment. A quasi-experimental research design
   was used. Participants were 455 seventh grade students from 12 classes
   of six junior high schools. A Web-based course, named BioCAL, combining
   three different formative assessment strategies was developed. The
   formative assessment strategies included Formative Assessment Module of
   the Web-Based Assessment and Test Analysis system (FAM-WATA) (with six
   Web-based formative assessment strategies), Normal Module of Web-Based
   Assessment and Test Analysis system (N-WATA) (only with partial
   Web-based formative assessment strategy) and Paper and Pencil Test
   (PPT) (without Web-based formative assessment strategy). Subjects were
   tested using Kolb's Learning Style Inventory, and assigned randomly by
   class into three groups. Each group took Web-based courses using one of
   the formative assessment strategies. Pre- and post-achievement testing
   was carried out. A one-way ANCOVA analysis showed that both learning
   style and formative assessment strategy are significant factors
   affecting student achievement in a Web-based learning environment.
   However, there is no interaction between these two factors. A post hoc
   comparison showed that performances of the FAM-WATA group are higher
   than the N-WATA and PPT groups. Learners with a 'Diverger' learning
   style performed best followed by, 'Assimilator', 'Accommodator', and
   'Converger', respectively. Finally, FAM-WATA group students are
   satisfied with six strategies of the FAM-WATA.

AB Research in integrated learning systems has demonstrated a need for
   rigorous studies that identify how such systems influence learning, and
   in particular that of low achieving students. No Child Left Behind
   legislation mandated evidence-based interventions as the standard for
   instructional approaches in American public schools. This
   quasi-experimental study investigated the impact of Merit literacy
   software on students in West Virginia. The study confirmed that the
   software supported the reading and language arts curriculum and
   significantly improved the scores of low achieving middle school
   students on three variables of the WESTEST, a criterion-referenced
   state test: reading and language arts, science, and social science.
   This integrated learning system was effective with rural and urban
   school populations.

TI The interactive effects of personal traits and guided practices on
   preservice teachers' changes in personal teaching efficacy
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CRITICAL-THINKING; CONSTRUCT
AB Personal teaching efficacy is associated with a teacher's effectiveness
   in the classroom. To enhance this efficacy in a computer-simulated
   training program, both personal traits and guided practices need to be
   considered concurrently. In this study, it was hypothesised that the
   interactive effects from the coupling of personal traits with guided
   practices would be a reliable predictor of the degree of improvement in
   personal teaching efficacy during computer-simulated training. One
   hundred and seventy-eight preservice teachers completed an interactive
   teaching experience via the Computer Simulation for Teaching General
   Critical-thinking Skills in which guided practices were integrated via
   specially designed teaching sequences and loops. The findings suggest
   that intrapersonal intelligence, critical-thinking dispositions and a
   judicial thinking style are related to self-awareness, analytical
   learning and reflective thinking and that in this study, these personal
   qualities seemingly interacted with guided practices, which resulted in
   reflective teaching and mastery experience. This, in turn, may very
   well have brought about improvement in the preservice teachers'
   personal teaching efficacy during the computer-simulated teaching.

ID INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; USER ACCEPTANCE; EDUCATION
AB This study describes a technological pilot project providing 160
   graduate students with asynchronous access to the ongoing proceedings
   of a lecture-based course. Exactly half of the students spoke the
   language of instruction, English, as a second language (ESL). While the
   asynchronous video-on-demand service proved popular overall, ESL
   students were markedly heavier users of the system and reported most
   enthusiastically on its benefits. Asynchronous access was valued as
   much for empowering the learner with control of the lecture as it was
   for the issue of convenience. Furthermore, the medium of video capture
   was found to create an impression of intimacy simultaneously cleansed
   of environmental distractions, an experience not necessarily consistent
   with live attendance. These findings became the foundation of a course
   distribution system now providing lectures to over 1,500 undergraduates
   each semester, yet many of the observed benefits remain to be confirmed
   by future research.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

ID COMPUTER ATTITUDES; RELIABILITY; STUDENTS; VALIDITY; GENDER
AB This paper presents the development and evaluation of a web-based
   lesson-Lesson Rainbow. This lesson features multiple representations
   (MRs), which purposefully deliver concepts in relation to distinctive
   disciplinary subject areas through story-based animations that are
   closely related to learners' life experiences. The researchers selected
   58 2nd-year junior high school students as the participants (32 males
   and 26 females). A quasi-experimental method together with
   semi-structured interviews was utilised. This research project was
   intended to investigate students' conceptual progress, and to evaluate
   the use of MRs and of situated learning components in the design of
   Lesson Rainbow. The statistical results indicated that: (1) students'
   science concepts significantly increased (t = 3.84, p < 0.01) through
   the use of Lesson Rainbow, and (2) students thought that the use of MRs
   in this web-based lesson was an effective pedagogical tool inasmuch as
   it allows for the learning of specific theoretical viewpoints in
   addition to the necessary background information. Lesson Rainbow
   employing MRs helps learners to understand the meanings of, and
   interrelationships between, different kinds of external
   representations. This kind of design facilitates their understanding of
   the correspondence between abstract symbolic expressions and real-world
   situations.

ID BELIEFS; MODELS
AB This study explores the private theories of four vocational education
   teachers in Singapore who have engaged in the design of
   technology-based learning for their own classes. The understanding of
   teachers' private theories is important in the context of contemporary
   educational reforms, which emphasise the shift towards student-centred
   practices and technology integration. As teachers learn to change
   strategies and utilise technology, they might also need to transform
   aspects of their private theories that could impede effective
   technology integration and lead them to continue with outdated
   educational practice. This study aims to understand and explicate areas
   of private theories that impede the effective design of student-centred
   technology-based learning. The final outcome of the study was a set of
   propositions for readers to examine for the possible application in
   their own environments.

   that has informed the design of programme as a whole which is based on
   a socio-constructivist perspective on learning. Our research is placed
   within an action research framework and we outline our position within
   the critical or emancipatory tradition and also our standpoint on the
   use of ICT in education. We discuss the design of the programme and
   also our pedagogical approach and describe in detail the particular
   context for this study. We report on the student experience of being
   learners on this module, their perceptions of what they have gained
   most from learning from and with each other and their responses to the
   various ways in which 'scaffolding' has been designed and implemented
   by the tutors. Finally we offer some reflections on the conditions for
   achieving well-orchestrated interdependence in open and flexible

AB Current distance learning systems are increasingly packing highly
   data-intensive contents on servers, resulting in the congestion of
   network and server resources at peak service times. A distributed
   learning system based on faded information field (FIF) architecture
   that employs mobile agents (MAs) has been proposed and simulated in
   this work. The learning contents are decentralised in the proposed
   system, and these are dynamically distributed around the main education
   site server on different nodes in response to network congestion and
   server overload. The system simulation results have been presented and
   analysed. The proposed system holds the potential to address the
   network congestion and server-overload problems in distance learning
   systems.

AB This paper reports on the results from a detailed national audit of
   information communication technology (ICT) in physical education (PE),
   examining attitudes, training, numbers of pieces of equipment and
   hardware owned, and its employment and use across nine Local Education
   Authorities, six types of schools, and four types of Specialist
   College. After setting the context, a summary of the survey methods
   used and an overview of the findings from 500 schools are presented.
   Results from 252 questionnaires returned suggested that the majority of
   PE teachers felt that ICT was a valuable teaching tool; however, parity
   of training and ownership of equipment were not standard across the
   range of schools or regions. Furthermore, the data suggest a growing
   trend in ICT use in PE across England.

TI Understanding teacher responses to constructivist learning
   environments: Challenges and resolutions
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PROJECT-BASED SCIENCE; SYSTEMIC REFORM; CLASSROOMS
AB The research literature is just beginning to uncover factors involved
   in sustaining constructivist learning environments, such as
   Project-Based Learning (PBL), Our case study investigates teacher
   responses to the challenges of constructivist environments, since
   teachers can play strong roles in supporting or undermining even the
   best constructivist environments or materials. We were invited to work
   as mediators with a middle-school science staff that was experiencing
   conflicts regarding two learning environments, PBL (which was the
   school's "politically correct" learning environment) and traditional.
   With mediated group workshops, teachers were sensitized to their own
   and colleagues' individual learning differences (ILDs), as measured by
   two styles inventories (the LSI-Kolb, 1976; and the LCI-Johnston &
   Dainton, 1997). Using these inventories, a learning-environment
   questionnaire, field notes, and delayed interviews a year later, we
   found that there was a relationship between teachers' preferred styles,
   epistemological beliefs, and their preferred teaching environment.
   Moreover, when the participating teachers, including early-adopters and
   nonvolunteers to PBL, became more sensitive to their colleagues'
   preferences, many staff conflicts were resolved and some mismatched
   teachers expressed more openness to PBL. We argue that having teachers
   understand their own ILDs and related responses to constructivist
   learning environments can contribute to resolving staff conflicts and
   sustaining such environments. We present a cognitive model and a
   strategy which illustrate this argument. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals,

   Associations with their views about science
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CLASSROOM PRACTICE; EDUCATION; BELIEFS; KNOWLEDGE; LITERACY; THINKING
AB School science students can benefit greatly from participation in
   student-directed, open-ended scientific inquiry projects. For various
   possible reasons, however, students tend not to be engaged in such
   inquiries. Among factors that may limit their opportunities to engage
   in open-ended inquiries of their design are teachers' conceptions about
   science. To explore possible relationships between teachers'
   conceptions about science and the types of inquiry activities in which
   they engage students, instrumental case studies of five secondary
   science teachers were developed, using field notes, repertory grids,
   samples of lesson plans and student activities, and semistructured
   interviews. Based on constructivist grounded theory analysis,
   participating teachers' tendencies to promote student-directed,
   open-ended scientific inquiry projects seemed to correspond with
   positions about the nature of science to which they indicated
   adherence. A tendency to encourage and enable students to carry out
   student-directed, open-ended scientific inquiry projects appeared to be
   associated with adherence to social constructivist views about science.
   Teachers who opposed social constructivist views tended to prefer tight
   control of student knowledge building procedures and conclusions. We
   suggest that these results can be explained with reference to human
   psychological factors, including those associated with teachers'
   self-esteem and their relationships with knowledge-building processes
   in the discipline of their teaching. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study examines the possibilities of differential impacts on
   students' earth science learning outcomes between different
   preferred-actual learning environment spaces by using a newly developed
   ESCLEI (Earth Science Classroom Learning Environment Instrument). The
   instrument emphasizes three simultaneously important classroom
   components: content, method, and assessment with both student-centered
   and teacher-centered scales embedded. Findings suggest that
   preferred-actual space (PAS(match)) between posttreatment perceptions
   and pretreatment preferences accounted for a more substantial and
   statistically significant amount of learning outcomes in terms of
   students' attitudes toward the subject matter with greater than large
   effect size, concerning practical significance in the actual earth
   science classroom. These findings suggest that earth science
   instruction in the secondary schools should bridge the gap between
   Students' preferred/perceived learning environment with the aim to
   enhance their learning outcomes. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Although there have been numerous studies examining the impacts of
   science fieldtrips and the effects of particular instructional
   practices (such as previsit orientation or postvisit follow-up), few
   studies have carefully examined the teacher's perspective toward these
   experiences (Anderson & Zhang, 2003, Visitor Studies Today, 6(3), 6-11;
   Griffin & Symington, 1997, Science Education, 81, 763-779; Lucas, 2000,

   Today, 4(1), 8-12). This investigation, part of a larger study aimed at
   describing teacher agendas for fieldtrips, looks closely at the
   instructional strategies used by teachers during the fieldtrip itself.
   Both survey methods and in-depth qualitative methods (interviews,
   observations) were used to create a categorization of strategies
   employed by upper elementary teachers from the greater Los Angeles
   area. Five overarching strategies were identified, including plan of
   action, structured engagement (such as tours or worksheets),
   unstructured engagement (Such as teacher facilitation), event
   documentation, and supervision strategies. Suggestions for using this
   information to support teacher utilization of informal settings such as
   science centers, as well as ideas for further study, are also
   discussed. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Guided scientific inquiry investigations are designed to have students
   reach particular answers through the thinking processes and activities
   of scientists. This presents a difficult challenge for teachers who
   must selectively hold back answers from students to maintain an
   atmosphere that encourages student-directed inquiry. The present study
   explores the different ways that three teachers describe and manage
   this problem with answers in a middle school physical science
   investigation. While one teacher managed the problem by treating the
   investigation as a game, another teacher accepted his students' ideas
   without evaluation, and the third spent considerable time rationalizing
   his teaching strategies to students. Researchers and policymakers need
   to explore the role of answers in guided scientific inquiry teaching so
   that they may better equip practitioners to address these problems when
   they arise. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study investigated the ways in which beliefs about the nature of
   the science vary as a function of an individual's chemistry expertise
   and chemistry research experience across the range from high-schools
   students, whose exposure to chemistry occurs in the classroom, to
   practicing research chemists. Interviews conducted with a total of 91
   participants probed three key research questions: Do the participants'
   epistemic beliefs vary as a function of chemistry expertise? Are there
   discipline-specific values and heuristics that guide chemistry
   research? How does research experience influence participants'
   epistemic beliefs? We found that participants' epistemic beliefs varied
   significantly with chemistry expertise and with exposure to authentic
   research in chemistry. Differences ill both the duration and the nature
   of participation in research had a significant effect on how
   participants conceptualized science and scientific research. We noted
   that only the practicing scientists saw a productive role for empirical
   anomalies that arise in the course of doing research. We found that
   research chemists thought about their scientific work in terms of a
   building or "engineering" model of science, rather than the classic
   hypothetico-deductive model of science invoked by some science
   educators. We concluded that current characterizations of the nature of
   science in science education may underrepresent important
   discipline-specific aspects of science. These results are discussed in
   terms of implications for science education. (c) 2006 Wiley

ID CONCEPTIONS; CONSTRAINTS
AB Using a theoretical perspective of communities of practice, this case
   study examines a prospective chemistry teacher's inquiry-based teaching
   during his practicum. Conrad was a former student of an
   inquiry-oriented science course, Inquiry Empowering Technologies (IET).
   The research questions were (a) How did Conrad translate the IET
   inquiry practices during his practicum?; (b) How did the mentor teacher
   shape Conrad's participation?; (c) In what ways did Conrad negotiate
   new meanings of inquiry as a result of his practicum? Interview
   transcripts were the primary data source. Conrad carried many of the
   IET inquiry practices into his practicum. He equated inquiry with the
   use of evidence and had students create evidence-based explanations for
   how soap works. He chose not to incorporate the tentative nature of
   science. Although traditional in his own teaching, the mentor teacher
   supported Conrad by allowing him to teach through inquiry and by
   removing time constraints. As a result of his practicum, Conrad
   negotiated new meanings of inquiry teaching and developed art expanded
   view of technology. Conrad believed that high school students needed
   guidance when engaging in inquiry and that the tentative nature of
   science does not transfer to secondary chemistry. Implications for
   theory and practice are given. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; SCIENCE; TEACHERS; CLASSROOM; CULTURE;

AB Science educators have recently begun to enact and study new,
   collaborative forms of professional development. Yet, few recognize
   that doing so requires contesting historical meanings of
   "university-school collaboration" and "professional development," both
   of which may operate to sustain a hierarchy model of collaboration. The
   hierarchy model maintains the flow of information and knowledge from
   universities to teachers to students. In science education, the
   hierarchy model may be strengthened by science's own history of
   hierarchy. This study describes the authors' attempt to contest the
   hierarchy model by facilitating a collaborative planning project with
   elementary teachers. Critical discourse analysis is used as the primary
   theoretical and methodological tool to (1) explain how the hierarchy
   model was shaped by and shaped the group's actions, interactions, and
   identities; (2) explain the complexities of collaboration by moving
   beyond deficit-based explanations (e.g., blaming individuals or
   organizational structures); (3) offer theoretical and methodological
   approaches for understanding better the nature of collaboration and
   practical solutions for those attempting to challenge the history of
   hierarchy. In focusing on how meaning is made in interaction, the
   authors demonstrate how language and interaction are inextricably bound
   with history and culture. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB This paper tracks the individual development of metacognition in two
   five year old children over an academic year as they engage in a
   cognitive acceleration through science education programme CASE@KS1.
   Using qualitative analysis and case study methods it demonstrates how
   collaborative group work with small children impacts on the development
   of their individual metacognitive processing. Important variables that
   facilitate or hinder this development are teased out and relationships
   between the groups and the individual are analysed. Difficulties with
   the concept of metacognition and in particular how to assess and
   measure it are discussed. A framework of analysis based on verbal
   interactions is developed from the early theories of metacognition and
   this is combined with an in-depth grounded analysis. This approach
   provides insight into what we can mean when we speak of young children
   being metacognitive.

DE context; metacognition; science conceptions
AB This paper addresses the problematic nature of pupils' attempts to use
   their science conceptions in contexts other than the ones in which the
   original learning of the concept takes place. It reports research with
   60 Year-5 primary school children studying current electricity, during
   which the researcher employed metacognitive activities alongside normal
   teaching procedures, in an attempt to enhance cross-contextual use of
   taught concepts. In order to assess the effect of different contexts on
   pupils' performance, a test was repeatedly administered over one school
   year that tested the same concepts in distinctly different contexts.
   Although the role of a familiar context is only partly determined, the
   results suggest that pupils' ability to use concepts in unfamiliar
   contexts is stable for a long period of time. The results also support
   the provision of metacognitive activities as a means of enhancing
   pupils' ability for cross-contextual use of their conceptions of
   science.

DE approach to learning; chemical engineering; cognition; metacognitive
   development
AB A series of studies were conducted to investigate students'
   metacognitive development in a second year chemical engineering course.
   The first of these was an exploratory study involving observation
   together with some limited interviewing. This was followed by a major
   study with two phases, the first of which involved a series of
   individual interviews with eleven students over the duration of the
   course, and the second of which involved a follow-up interview with
   each student two years later. In the first phase of the major study a
   theoretical framework characterising metacognitive development as a
   shift in approach to learning was utilised. The present paper draws on
   the findings of the second phase of the major study to both confirm the
   validity of this framework and also point to some of its shortcomings,
   specifically regarding the necessity of a certain emotional state in
   order for metacognitive development to take place, and the importance
   of the formation of a professional identity. It is suggested that
   metacognitive development needs to be characterised in broader terms
   than the usual cognitive focus in order to more fully account for
   students' experiences of learning.

AB An element of current reform in science education worldwide is the
   shift from the dominant traditional algorithmic lower-order cognitive
   skills (LOCS) teaching, to the higher-order cognitive skills
   (HOCS)-promoting learning; that is, the development of students'
   capabilities including those of question asking (QA), critical/system
   thinking (CST), decision making (DM), problem solving (PS),
   conceptualisation of fundamental concepts (CFC) and the transfer of
   these within both the science disciplines and real life
   interdisciplinary situations. Accordingly, an innovative
   metacognition-promoting science teacher professional development
   course, integrating formal and informal science education, was
   developed and implemented within a traditional model, focusing on the
   HOCS skills of QA, PS, and CFC. The HOCS promoting teaching and
   assessment strategies of this course not only enabled participants to
   reflect on their own learning, but also facilitated their
   self-reflective assessment, utilising a pre-post designed
   research-based methodology. The results suggest that such, or similarly
   appropriate, metacognition-oriented courses can contribute positively
   to the development of science teachers' HOCS capability.

AB A debate is ongoing in Hong Kong regarding whether local and

   classroom learning environments that support the development of

   investigated commonalities and variations in the metacognitive
   orientation of local and international schools in Hong Kong.
   Commonalities and substantive differences in the metacognitive
   orientation of the classroom learning environments were identified and
   these variations might, to some extent, be explained with reference to
   cultural variations regarding the purposes and processes of education.
   This research provides a further example of the value of the concept of
   learning environments for addressing educational questions that might
   otherwise be resolved with reference to primarily anecdotal data and

AB This study examined whether online tool Support for regulation promotes
   student learning during collaborative inquiry in a computer
   simulation-based learning environment. Sixty-one students worked in
   small groups to conduct a scientific inquiry with fluid dynamics.
   Groups in the experimental condition received a support tool with
   regulatory guidelines; control groups were given a version of this tool
   from which these instructions were removed. Results showed facilitative
   effects for the fully specified support tool on learning outcomes and
   initial planning. Qualitative data elucidated how regulative guidelines
   enhanced learning and suggests ways to further improve regulative
   processes within collaborative inquiry learning settings.

AB This paper reports on a detailed investigation into the beliefs and
   practices of teachers in 22 computer-assisted learning projects in
   Australia in the mid-1990s. Detailed interview data were obtained,
   supported by the project software and other Curriculum materials. The
   interview transcripts and documentary material were collated and
   condensed into rich descriptions; these were then coded on a number of
   belief and practice dimensions. The resulting profiles were clustered
   into five belief-practice categories: thoughtful instructors,
   pre-emptive professionals, conversational constructivists, learning
   facilitators and situated knowledge negotiators. These complex, yet
   interpretable, patterns of relationships between beliefs and practices
   are useful in understanding teachers' reluctance to change their
   teaching, one instance of which is the relatively limited uptake of
   technology in higher education.

AB In this paper, we give a detailed account of the design principles and
   construction of activities designed for learning about the
   relationships between position, velocity and acceleration, and
   corresponding kinematics graphs. Our approach is model-based, that is,
   it focuses attention on the idea that students constructed their own
   models-in the form of programs-to formalise and thus extend their
   existing knowledge. In these activities, students controlled the
   movement of objects in a programming environment, recording the motion
   data and plotting corresponding position-time and velocity-time graphs.
   They shared their findings on a specially designed Web-based
   collaboration system, and posted cross-site challenges to which others
   could react. We present learning episodes that provide evidence of
   students making discoveries about the relationships between different
   representations of motion. We conjecture that these discoveries arose
   from their activity in building models of motion and their
   participation in classroom and online communities.

AB The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects on learning of

   illustrations in the form of pop-up windows that are opened by the
   user. Three groups of students viewed illustrated texts depicting the
   functioning of the heart and the replication of the AIDS virus either
   with textual information presented below the picture, with textual
   information integrated within the picture, or with textual information
   integrated within the picture with pop-up windows. The results showed
   that the integrated formats were more effective than the separated
   format when we tested the retention of textual information,
   comprehension and the matching of textual elements to the appropriate
   illustrated elements. Furthermore, they indicated that the group
   working with pop-up windows performed better than the integrated groups
   on the retention test for illustrated information as well as when asked
   to find correct solutions to problems in a comprehension test.
   Consequently, these findings Support the use of pop-up windows in

TI Semantic learning designs: recording assumptions and guidelines
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Recent developments in the standardisation of learning technology have
   resulted in models of learning activities and resources including
   descriptive metadata and definitions of conditional flows for multirole
   activities. Nonetheless, such learning designs are actually
   representations of the results of the design process and do not provide
   information about the rationale of the design, ie, about the
   theoretical standpoints, assumptions or guidelines applied to come up
   with the concrete arrangement of activities. These latter elements are
   critical not only for informative reasons, but as a medium towards the
   end of connecting theories and hypotheses to actual practice and
   analysing the resulting empirical data as a form of inquiry on the
   validity of theoretical assumptions. This paper delineates the main
   aspects of a schema for the recording of such design rationales using
   an ontological approach. The method for the engineering of the schema
   was based on connecting the definitions provided with an existing large
   ontological base, thus reusing a large amount of common sense
   knowledge. Two paradigmatic example positions of the range of aspects
   that could be covered by the representation language are described as
   an illustration. The resulting ontological definitions can be used as a
   foundation for the refinement of theoretical positions and for their
   comparative assessment.

ID PERSONALITY; ONTOLOGIES
AB Recent developments of e-learning specifications such as Learning
   Object Metadata (LOM), Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM),
   Learning Design and other pedagogy research in semantic e-learning have
   shown a trend of applying innovative computational techniques,
   especially Semantic Web technologies, to promote existing
   content-focused learning services to semantic-aware and personalised
   learning services. To facilitate this transforming process, this paper
   presents a novel context-aware semantic e-learning approach to
   integrate content provision, learning process and learner personality
   in an integrated semantic e-learning framework. As the basis of the
   computational framework, a scalable and extensible generic context
   model is proposed to structure the semantics of contextual relations
   and concepts in various contexts, such as learning content description,
   learning model, knowledge object representation and learner
   personality. Corresponding technical and pedagogical developments of
   this framework also consider compatibility issues with existing
   technologies (eg, XML/Resource Description Framework) and
   specifications (eg, IEEE LOM) in order to achieve the best
   interoperability.

TI Ontology mappings to improve learning resource search
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID OF-THE-ART; SEMANTIC WEB
AB This paper proposes an ontology mapping-based framewrowrk that allows
   searching for learning resources using multiple ontologies. The present
   applications of ontologies in e-learning use various ontologies (eg,
   domain, curriculum, context), but they do not give a solution on how to
   interoperate e-learning systems based on different ontologies. The
   proposed solution uses a mapping ontology that is a part of a recent
   Semantic Web initiative, the Simple Knowledge Organisation System. On
   top of that, we develop and implement two search algorithms. Finally,
   we evaluated the solution by developing a system that helps students
   search for relevant learning resource using a local context (ie, course
   curriculum) ontology.

TI TM4L: Creating and browsing educational topic maps
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In this article, we describe TM4L, an environment for building,
   maintaining and using standards-based, ontology-aware e-learning
   repositories. It is based on the idea that concept-driven access to
   learning material implemented as a topic map can bridge the gap between
   a learner and targeted knowledge. One of the driving goals of this work
   is to increase the reusability of available educational resources by
   enabling the use of a developed subject ontology with courses on the
   same subject with different stricture. Another goal of TM4L is to
   support an efficient context-based retrieval of learning content
   tailored to the needs of a learner working on an educational task. The
   paper focuses on three aspects of the TM4L environment: domain
   modelling, editing capabilities and the interface for exploring the
   learning collection. The key features of the TM4L functionality are
   illustrated with some examples.

TI Semantic-aware components and services of ActiveMath
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB ActiveMath is a complex web-based adaptive learning environment with a
   number of components and interactive learning tools. The basis for
   handling semantics of learning content is provided by its semantic
   (mathematics) content markup, which is additionally annotated with
   educational metadata. Several components, tools and external services
   can make use of that content markup, eg, a course generator, a semantic
   search engine and user input evaluation services. The components and
   services have to communicate, pass content and state changes, actions,
   etc including mathematical semantics and educational markup. The novel
   event infrastructure supports this communication. This paper focuses on
   the usage of the content's semantics by selected novel components and
   sketches the communication.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper, we describe concept parsing algorithms, a novel semantic
   analysis methodology at the core of a new pedagogy that focuses
   learners' attention on deep comprehension of the conceptual content of
   learned material. Two new e-learning tools are described in some
   detail: interactive concept discovery learning and meaning equivalence
   reusable learning objects. These semantic technologies were developed
   at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education and Adaptive
   Technology Resource Centre of Faculty of Information Studies (ATRC/FIS)
   at the University of Toronto; they were tested since 2001 in several
   academic institutions in Canada and at the Russian Academy of Sciences
   (patents pending: US patent 6,953,344 B2, USPO sharp20050149510;
   Copyright 2005, PARCEP Inc.). We describe the rationale for developing
   these instructional tools, their main characteristics and results of
   several evaluative implementations that show their potential to enhance
   learning outcomes and to provide authentic, credible, evidence-based
   formative assessments of learning processes.

TI Towards a semantic e-learning theory by using a modelling approach
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In the present study, a semantic perspective on e-learning theory is
   advanced and a modelling approach is used. This modelling approach
   towards the new learning theory is based on the four SECI phases of
   knowledge conversion: Socialisation, Externalisation, Combination and
   Internalisation, introduced by Nonaka in 1994, and involving two levels
   of knowledge-tacit and explicit. In the Socialisation phase, the
   teacher-student interaction activates the exploratory learning
   behaviour. This phase is emotionally and socially loaded. The
   Externalisation phase is partly emotional but a cognitive dimension is
   also needed, which requires creativity. This phase works optimally if
   it is collaborative in nature. In the Combination phase, an ability for
   hypothetical-deductive thinking is needed for the modelling approach.
   During the Internalisation phase, the learning process requires that
   students engage in seeking to understand and explain natural phenomena,
   which further demands testing of the theoretical concepts.

AB Singapore has many large and educationally valuable digital collections
   and is planning the development of many more. These digital collections
   contain historical, cultural and scientific multimedia objects, along
   with learning objects. At present, school teachers and pupils find it
   hard to locate many of these resources using traditional search
   engines. This paper describes a research investigation into the design
   and subsequent development of a prototype digital resource discovery
   portal (Digital Content Exchange) based on Semantic Web technologies,
   and explores some of the educational issues raised. The research
   project explored how the features of the Semantic Web might offer
   valuable additional educational benefits and affordances beyond that of
   those based on existing information retrieval technologies.

TI Semantic e-learning: synthesising fantasies
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB When the subject of scientific analysis is learning, the research needs
   to be anchored in various nonmonolithic pillars. Several disciplines
   require a common ground of convergence. An objective observer of the
   domain can easily conclude that semantic e-learning brings together the
   three different worlds of learners, pedagogues and technologists.
   In this short concluding paper of the special issue, we criticise the
   monolithic approaches to technology-enhanced learning. We argue that
   semantic e-learning presents a critical research challenge to move
   towards extended openness, meaning exploitation and unforeseen learning
   opportunities for the global community.
   The concluding remark is a call for a new learning generation primer.
   Synthesizing fantasies is in fact an invitation to semantically define
   our commitment to collaborate and to agree on the technology-enabled
   services that bring learning to the forefront. The promotion of the
   knowledge-and-learning-society requires an integration of the demand
   and supply side of knowledge and learning.

AB This study explored teacher perspectives on the use of socioscientific
   issues (SSI) and on dealing with ethics in the context of science
   instruction. Twenty-two middle and high school science teachers from
   three US states participated in semi-structured interviews, and
   researchers employed inductive analyses to explore emergent patterns
   relative to the following two questions. (1) How do science teachers
   conceptualize the place of ethics in science and science education? (2)
   How do science teachers handle topics with ethical implications and
   expression of their own values in their classrooms? Profiles were
   developed to capture the views and reported practices, relative to the
   place of ethics in science and science classrooms, of participants.
   Profile A comprising teachers who embraced the notion of infusing
   science curricula with SSI and cited examples of using controversial
   topics in their classes. Profile B participants Supported SSI curricula
   in theory but reported significant constraints which prohibited them
   from actualizing these goals. Profile C described teachers who were
   non-committal with respect to focusing instruction on SSI and ethics.
   Profile D was based on the position that science and science education
   should be value-free. Profile E transcended the question of ethics in
   science education; these teachers felt very strongly that all education
   should contribute to their students' ethical development. Participants
   also expressed a wide range of perspectives regarding the expression of
   their own values in the classroom. Implications of this research for
   science education are discussed. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This case Study focused on a preservice teachers' (Morgan) efforts to
   explicitly emphasize nature of science (NOS) elements in her
   first-grade internship classroom. The study assessed the change in
   first grade students' views of the inferential, tentative, and creative
   NOS as a result of the explicit instruction. Morgan held appropriate
   views of NOS, had the intention and motivation to teach NOS, and had a
   supporting experience explicitly emphasizing NOS embedded in physics
   content to peer college students. Data sources included weekly
   classroom observations of explicit NOS science lessons taught by
   Morgan, interview of Morgan to determine that her views of NOS were
   informed and that she would have the NOS content knowledge to teach in
   line with recommended reforms, and interviews of the first-grade
   students pre- and postinstruction to determine the influence of
   Morgan's instruction on their views of observation and inference, the
   tentative NOS, and the creative and imaginative NOS. Data were analyzed
   to determine (a) the approaches Morgan used to emphasize NOS in her
   instruction, and (b) students' views of NOS pre and postinstruction to
   track change in their views. It was found that Morgan was able to
   explicitly emphasize NOS using three teacher-designed methods, and that
   the influence on student views of the inferential, tentative, and
   creative NOS was positive. Implications for teacher development are
   provided. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study investigated the influence of two different explicit
   instructional approaches in promoting more informed understandings of
   nature of science (NOS) among students. Participants, a total of 42
   students, comprised two groups in two intact sections of ninth grade.
   Participants in the two groups were taught environmental science by
   their regular classroom teacher, with the difference being the context
   in which NOS was explicitly taught. For the "integrated" group, NOS
   instruction was related to the science content about global warming.
   For the "nonintegrated" group, NOS was taught through a set of
   activities that specifically addressed NOS issues and were dispersed
   across the content about global warming. The treatment for both groups
   spanned 6 weeks and addressed a unit about global warming and NOS. An
   open-ended questionnaire, in conjunction with semistructured
   interviews, was used to assess students' views before and after
   instruction. Results showed improvements in participants' views of NOS
   regardless of whether NOS was integrated within the regular content
   about global warming. Comparison of differences between the two groups
   showed "slightly" greater improvement in the informed views of the
   integrated group participants. On the other hand, there was greater
   improvement in the transitional views of the nonintegrated group
   participants. Therefore, the overall results did not provide any
   conclusive evidence in favor of one approach over the other.
   Implications on the teaching and learning of NOS are discussed. (c)

AB Spurred by Students who felt conflicted accepting evolution and the
   tenets of their faiths, yet knowing their faiths Supported science and
   evolution, we began a Study to determine the views clergy espouse on
   issues related to evolution, creationism, science, and religion. The
   resulting study included structured interviews with eight clergy and a
   religion professor, and a survey and questionnaire sent to each member
   of in organization made up of clergy. The data revealed a group who
   believed evolution and their religion to be compatible, that scripture
   was not meant to be understood literally, and who felt strongly that
   creationism did not belong in public school classrooms. The science
   education community may find in clergy an articulate ally in helping
   citizens to understand the contentious issues surrounding evolution and
   creationism. We share the insights that respondents provided on these
   issues and compared their views to those of teachers. (c) 2006 Wiley

AB Evaluation has become an everyday activity for many us, whether of our
   practice in the classroom, the student experience, institutional
   performance or funded projects. This article looks at the main aspects
   of evaluation and adopts a systematic approach to evaluation by looking
   at why, what, for and by whom, when and how to evaluate. The emphasis
   is on why we want to evaluate and its use in decision making rather
   than on how we are going to carry it out. The assumption is also that
   we want to involve as many stakeholders in the evaluation as possible
   so as to promote greater ownership of the whole process.

AB The trend towards the use of the Internet in academia is clear with a
   number of courses using the Web for the delivery of course material.
   Flexible access to information and resources are key attributes of
   online educational technologies, and learner choice is at the heart of
   the concept of flexible access. This incorporates the facility to
   access subject matter content and support at a time, place and pace
   that is suitable and convenient for the individual learner. In this
   paper we describe the designing of multimedia instruction in a
   Slovenian context. Some practical advice for structuring and designing
   are given. The advantages of such instruction are described and
   students' opinions about studying with the help of multimedia
   instruction are presented.

AB This article argues that developing a team-based approach to teaching
   and learning provides the basis for building commitment and continuous
   professional development in teaching practice among staff in higher
   education. A team approach that is grounded in practice leads to open
   communication and opportunities for formal and informal professional
   development. The article presents a case study based on an
   undergraduate level-one marketing module and reports on the experiences
   of the teaching team over three years. Key issues faced by the module
   leader and teaching colleagues are discussed. The approaches adopted
   have been successful in focusing attention on student learning, leading
   to more continuous professional development.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB As increasing numbers of students participate in international travel
   courses as part of their collegiate business curriculum, there has been
   a corresponding rise in academic discussion about how institutions and
   trip leaders can best prepare for, and manage, the travel experience.
   While the study of history, politics, and economics of the region to be
   visited commonly provides valuable content for the travel course, such
   preparation does not address the psychological processes that accompany
   student group travel under conditions that are necessarily uncertain
   and stressful. To fill this course management gap, we recommend
   teaching and training in emotional intelligence competencies. As a
   curriculum component of international travel courses, knowledge of and
   practice in emotional intelligence competencies serve the students,
   trip leader(s), course, and institution by improving the learning
   process and increasing group effectiveness.

AB Although the use of computer technology in classrooms is an innovative
   approach to teaching, teachers with creativity might not use technology
   as intensively as they use other creative strategies in the classroom.
   Eight teachers who won an award for creative teaching were interviewed
   in order to identify the factors affecting their use of technology in
   creative teaching. Teachers' perceptions about technology use were
   studied. Two major issues were explored. First, we studied how teachers
   integrated technology into creative teaching; we then identified the
   factors that influenced teachers' use of technology in teaching. The
   identified factors were classified into four categories: environmental,
   personal, social and curricular issues.

AB This paper reports the results of a study into the quality of peer
   feedback provided by students within a computerised peer-assessment
   environment. The study looks at the creation of a 'feedback index' that
   represents the quality of an essay based upon the feedback provided
   during a peer-marking process and identifies a significant positive
   correlation between this index and the average marks produced for an
   essay. The data produced are analysed in an attempt to ascertain
   whether specific groups of students, based upon their ability in
   developing an essay within this subject area, in general tend to mark
   and/or comment on their peers either too generously or too critically.

ID SCIENCE
AB The development of a science education that includes a focus upon the
   nature of science suggests the need for "pedagogic tools" that can be
   used to engage children with the procedural understandings that are
   central to the scientific approach to enquiry. This paper reports on a
   collaborative action research project that focused on the use of
   secondary data as just such a "tool" for stimulating engagement with
   procedural understandings among primary school children. It argues that
   the comparative analysis of secondary and investigative data can
   provide a basis for such engagement. However, such comparative analysis
   will only mirror the collaborative nature of the scientific enterprise
   where children have guided opportunities to discuss their understanding
   of the issues revealed by the comparisons. The research suggests that
   children work best with this data if the scientific approach to enquiry
   is contextualized through connection with the knowledge claims made in
   science.

TI Modelling analysis of students' processes of generating scientific
   explanatory hypotheses
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

DT Article
ID SCIENCE
AB It has recently been determined that generating an explanatory
   hypothesis to explain a discrepant event is important for students'
   conceptual change. The purpose of this study is to investigate how
   students generate new explanatory hypotheses. To achieve this goal,
   questions are used to identify students' prior ideas related to
   electromagnetic induction. After showing conflicting phenomena, six
   college students are asked to suggest explanatory hypotheses to explain
   the phenomena. Using interviews, the processes of generating
   explanatory hypotheses are analyzed and three types of hypotheses
   suggested by students are subsequently identified: theoretical,
   experiential, and auxiliary hypotheses. In addition, models of
   generating each type of explanatory hypothesis are also suggested. It
   is concluded that subjects use similarity-based reasoning to relate
   their background knowledge or experiences with the conflicting
   phenomena to be explained. Background knowledge plays a very important
   role in generating new theoretical explanatory hypotheses. An example
   of a scientific inquiry activity for improving the skill of "generating
   scientific hypotheses" is also presented in this paper.

DT Article
ID SCIENTIFIC LITERACY
AB The language used to construct knowledge, beliefs, and worldviews in
   school science is distinct from the social language that students use
   in their everyday ordinary life. This difference is a major source of
   reading difficulty for many students, especially struggling readers and
   English-language learners. This article identifies some of the
   linguistic challenges involved in reading middle-school science texts
   and suggests several teaching strategies to help students cope with
   these challenges. It is argued that explicit attention to the unique
   language of school science should be an integral part of science
   literacy pedagogy.

ID SCIENTIFIC TERMINOLOGY; COURSES; WEIGHT; NEED
AB A study was made of the ability of a population of high-school physics
   teachers to define physics concepts and of their views regarding the
   importance of such definitions. It was found possible to arrange the
   definitions accumulated in categories, and the classification so
   obtained was consonant with that of the philosophy of science. Although
   the subjects of this study were experienced teachers, the definitions
   they supplied exhibited shortcomings. Despite this, however, the
   teachers attached great importance to a knowledge of concept
   definitions. The implications of these findings in connection with the
   ongoing debate regarding the importance of concept definitions in
   science education are discussed. The high educational value of concept
   definitions is argued and a deficiency in this knowledge points to the
   shortcoming in teacher training.

ID KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE
AB Although electromagnetism is an important component of upper secondary
   school physics syllabuses in many countries, there has been relatively
   little research on students' understanding of the topic. A written test
   consisting of 16 diagnostic questions was developed and used to survey
   the understanding of electromagnetism of upper secondary school
   students in Turkey (n = 120) and England ( n = 152). A separate test
   consisting of 10 questions on the visualization of spatial rotation was
   used to investigate the hypothesis that students' ability to visualize
   three-dimensional situations from two-dimensional representations might
   influence learning of electromagnetism. Many students' responses showed
   misunderstandings and inconsistencies that suggested they did not have
   a coherent framework of ideas about electromagnetism. Common errors
   included confusing electric and magnetic field effects, seeing field
   lines as indicating a "flow" ,using cause-effect reasoning in
   situations where it does not apply, and dealing with effects associated
   with the rate of change of a variable. Performance on the spatial
   rotation test was, however, only weakly correlated with performance on
   the electromagnetism questions. The findings suggest the need to
   develop teaching strategies that help students to visualize magnetic
   field patterns and effects, and assist them in integrating ideas into a
   more coherent framework.

AB Cross-domain analysis was used to examine changes in two attitudinal
   dimensions: students' attitudes towards science and attitudes about the
   utility of science over the middle school and high school years. A
   sample of 444 students was selected from the Longitudinal Study of
   American Youth. The results show that the overall trend for students'
   attitudes about the utility of science is positive; however, attitudes
   towards science decline over the middle school and high school years.
   Important time-varying predictors of both attitudes include science
   self-concept, peer attitudes, teacher encouragement of science, and, to
   a lesser extent, student participation in science activities.

AB Due to the implementation of a 9-year integrated curriculum scheme in
   Taiwan, research on team teaching and web-based technology appears to
   be urgent. The purpose of this study was incorporated web-assisted
   learning with team teaching in seventh-grade science classes. The
   specific research question concerned student performance and attitudes
   about the teaching method. Two certified science teachers and four
   classes of the seventh graders participated in this study. It used a
   mixed methods design, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative
   techniques. The main data included students' scores, questionnaires,
   teachers' self-reflections, and the researcher's interviews with
   teachers. The results showed that the average final examination scores
   of students experiencing the experimental teaching method were higher
   than that of those receiving traditional teaching. The two teaching
   methods showed significant difference in respect of students'
   achievement. The research had limitations because of students'
   abilities of data collection, computer use, and discussion, but more
   than one-half of the students preferred the experimental method to
   traditional teaching. However, team teachers would encounter the
   problems of technology ability, time constraints, and entrance
   examination pressure.

TI High school marine science and scientific literacy: The promise of an
   integrated science course
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID EDUCATION; ATTITUDES; KNOWLEDGE
AB This descriptive study provides a comparison of existing high school
   marine science curricula and instructional practices used by nine
   teachers across seven schools districts in Florida and their students'
   level of scientific literacy, as defined by the national science
   standards and benchmarks. To measure understandings of science concepts
   and Science - Technology - Society- related issues, students were
   assessed at the beginning and end of their course using three
   instruments developed by the researcher. Paired-sample t tests revealed
   a significant improvement ( p <.001, t = 4.42, n = 399, Cohen's d =
   0.22) from 39.5% on the pre science assessment to 42.9% on the post
   science assessment. Students of teachers who integrated biological,
   chemical, geological, and physical characteristics of the oceans
   performed higher on the content assessment than other students. Based
   on a Likert scale survey, students' understandings of Science -
   Technology - Society- related issues did not significantly change,
   although post-instruction qualitative responses were reflective of the
   national science standards and benchmarks. Results indicate that marine
   science can be used as a model for teaching integrated science if
   curricula and instructional practices are aligned to national standards.

TI Durability of changes in self-efficacy of preservice primary teachers
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID ELEMENTARY TEACHERS; SCIENCE; CONCEPTIONS; CONFIDENCE; KNOWLEDGE
AB Many preservice primary teachers initially have a low self-efficacy, or
   belief in their ability to teach science, but well-designed science
   education courses can produce significant positive changes in efficacy
   beliefs. However, the extent to which the belief changes are durable,
   or maintained over time, is yet to be established. The purpose of this
   study was to investigate the durability of changes in preservice
   primary teachers' self-efficacy beliefs. Their science teaching
   self-efficacy was measured at the beginning and end of a science
   methods course, and then after a delay period of 9 months. Interviews
   were carried out 1 year after the end of the course. The results
   indicated that positive changes in self-efficacy occurred as a result
   of the course, and these high levels were still present after the delay
   period. Having an opportunity to teach science in primary school was a
   significant factor in consolidating efficacy levels after the methods
   course.

AB Thinking about macroscopic phenomena in terms of models based on the
   idea of microscopic particles (i.e., the particulate theory of matter)
   is one of the important goals for student learning in chemistry around
   the world. However, previous research suggests that students do not
   easily understand phenomena from a particle perspective, although such
   a perspective has many concrete aspects that ought to assist learners
   of chemistry. More than the textbooks of other countries, Korean
   chemistry texts tend to include colorful inscriptions. How, we might
   ask, do such inscriptions help learners of chemistry? The purpose of
   this study is to investigate the function and structure of chemical
   inscriptions in middle school science textbooks by drawing on a
   semiotic framework. We develop the concept of "chemi (stry)-semiotics"
   to unveil the work of reading required to understand chemical
   inscriptions in the way their authors intended them to be understood.
   The study began with the assumption that different kinds and functions
   (structure) of inscriptions constitute different "signs" that are
   available as sense-making resources in the learning process. We show
   that the difficulty in understanding the particulate nature of matter
   may result from the different processes of semiosis (interpretation and
   meaning making) between inscriptions depicting macroscopic and models
   based on microscopic particles. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The paper presents an intensive study of a micro-event aiming at the
   characterization of teacher's discourse from a multimodal communication
   perspective in a secondary school science classroom dealing with the
   topic of "water cycle." The research addresses the following questions:
   (a) What communicative modes are used by the teacher?, (b) what role do
   the different communicative modes play within teacher's discourse?, and
   (c) what are the relationships among communicative modes being used by
   the teacher? Theoretical framework is developed based on three strands:
   multimodal communication, science teaching and learning as modeling,
   and social semotics and Halliday's functional grammar. An analytic
   scheme guiding teachers' discourse analysis is presented and results
   discussed. Implications for science teacher education are drawn that
   would contribute to the improvement of science teacher education. (c)

ID POST-NORMAL SCIENCE; NEGOTIATION; DEBATE; POLICY
AB In this paper, we report some reflections on science and education, in
   relation to teaching and research in the field of complex and
   controversial socio-environmental issues. Starting from an examination
   of the literature on the epistemological aspects of the science of
   controversial issues, and introducing the perspective of complexity,
   the article argues for a complexity of content, context, and method in
   understanding current problems. Focusing on a model of learning which
   includes dialogical and reflective approaches, the final part of the
   article reports on aspect of the authors' experimental practice with
   role-play for dealing with complex issues. The review of the literature
   and our experience of action-research introduce a view of education
   which promotes young people's awareness of multiple points of view, an
   ability to establish relationships between processes, scales, and
   contexts which may be nonlinearly related, and practice with creative
   and nonviolent forms of interrelations with others. Such an approach in
   science education is coherent with a scenario of planet sustainability
   based on ecological webs and equity principles. (c) 2006 Wiley

TI The role of Rasch analysis when conducting science education research
   utilizing multiple-choice tests
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Recent international studies note that countries whose students perform
   well on international science assessments report the need to change
   science education. Some countries use assessments for diagnostic
   purposes to assist teachers in addressing their students' needs.
   However, in the United States, standards-based reform has focused the
   national discussion on documenting students' attainment of high
   educational standards. Students' science achievement is one of those
   standards, and in many states, "high-stakes" tests determine the
   resultant achievement measures. Policymakers and administrators use
   those tests to rank school performance, to prevent students'
   graduation, and to evaluate teachers. With science test measures used
   in different ways, statistical confidence in the measures' validity and
   reliability is essential. Using a science achievement test from one
   state's systemic reform project as an example, this paper discusses the
   strengths of the Rasch model as a psychometric tool and analysis
   technique, referring to person item maps, anchoring, differential item
   functioning, and person item fit. Furthermore, the paper proposes that
   science educators should carefully inspect the tools they use to
   measure and document changes in educational systems. (c) 2005 Wiley

ID LITERACY; PROJECT
AB Although reading is a critical part of science and science learning, it
   is no longer a part of many children's elementary science instruction.
   This is of concern because girls often develop strong identities as
   readers, but do not develop scientific identities with ease. In this
   study, we investigate girls' science reading to know (1) if science
   books were available to girls in homes and classrooms, (2) if girls
   were choosing to read them, and (3) what influences their choices.
   Forty-five third-grade girls, 29 of their families, and three of their
   teachers were interviewed to ascertain girls' preferences among various
   book genres, as well as to learn the ways in which families and
   teachers influence the choices girls make. We found that girls had
   access to science books at school, and teachers had strategies to
   encourage reading them. At home, parents encouraged reading, but were
   generally less directive than teachers as to what the girls read, and
   underestimated their daughters' science-related interests. The families
   studied rely largely on major bookstores as their primary source of
   books. Our findings suggest we need to understand better the way gender
   influences girls' engagement with science in a variety of contexts,
   particularly those in which girls exercise choice. (c) 2006 Wiley

AB A new but costly approach to providing visitors of zoos with
   information on conservation is the presentation of small exhibits by
   zoo professionals or volunteers. At these "touch tables" visitors can
   find out about the biology, ecology, and conservation of animals kept
   in the zoo. We studied the effect of a touch table on visitors'
   learning in a Swiss zoo (Tierpark Goldau) using an experimental
   approach. For half of each day, visitors could choose to gain
   information from labels next to the enclosures and posters. In
   addition, for the other half of the day visitors could also choose to
   make use of a touch table on the bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus).
   More than 600 visitors participated in the study. Results revealed that
   the modern approach was successful. Visitors using the touch table knew
   more about the biology, ecology, and conservation of bearded vultures,
   both immediately after their visit to the zoo and two months later. It
   is suggested that more use be made of touch tables in zoos, museums,
   visitor centers, and other settings for nature education. (c) 2005

AB Expert scientific inquiry involves the generation and use of analogies.
   How and when students might develop this aspect of expertise has
   implications for understanding how and when instruction might
   facilitate that development. In a study of K-8 student inquiry in
   physical science, we are examining cases of spontaneous analogy
   generation. In the case we present here, a third-grader generates an
   analogy and modifies it to reconcile his classmates' counterarguments,
   allowing us to identify in these third-graders specific aspects of
   nascent expertise in analogy use. Promoting abilities and inclinations
   such as these children display requires that educators recognize and
   respond to them. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID DELIVERY EVALUATION QUESTIONNAIRE
AB This inquiry examines the personal attribute and environmental factors
   that contribute to and impede science teacher-leader development. Using
   a narrative approach, the inquiry focuses on the experiences of three
   teachers in three different New Zealand primary schools (years 1-6) as
   they develop in their capabilities as science teacher-leaders during
   sustained schoolwide science delivery improvement projects.
   Bronfenbrenner's bio-ecological model and Rutter's views on resiliency
   are used as a foundation for interpreting the science teacher-leader
   development process. Teachers identify a variety of personal attribute
   and environmental factors and the interplay between these factors as
   risk and supportive factors contributing to and impeding their
   development as science teacher-leaders. Teachers also identify that
   their development is influenced by several proximal processes that are
   context and time dependent. Ramifications of this study in the context
   of general school curriculum, in particular science development, are
   also considered. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Science teachers must adapt curriculum materials, so preservice
   teachers must develop beginning proficiency with this authentic task of
   teaching. What criteria do they use when they critique these materials
   in preparation for adapting them, when they develop the criteria
   themselves and when they are given a set of criteria from which to
   choose? These results indicate that the 20 participating preservice
   elementary teachers held a sophisticated set of criteria for critiquing
   instructional materials; for example, they paid attention to scientific
   inquiry and instructional goals. In some cases, providing options from
   which they could select as a part of the instructional approach taken
   in the class allowed the preservice teachers to engage in substantive
   critique of the instructional materials along criteria not prominent in
   their initial set. Even with explicit support, however, the preservice
   teachers did not engage in substantive critique about how scientific
   content is represented. Furthermore, they typically describe inquiry as
   important to incorporate to promote student interest, not to engage
   students in genuine scientific activity. It is concluded that critique
   activities used in science methods courses should be authentic and
   scaffolded to be optimally effective. Critique along especially
   challenging dimensions needs systematic, explicit, and perhaps more
   consistent support. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The "No Child Left Behind" (NCLB) Act has made schools accountable for
   assuring adequate yearly progress of students. Therefore, it has become
   critical to identify school-level variables that can be controlled to
   affect student achievement, especially given that, thus far, most
   school reform efforts have failed to significantly affect student
   achievement. This study identifies four theoretical constructs, three
   unique sets of empirical factors (one set for each group: students,
   teachers, and principals), and seven experiential themes that describe
   the middle school environment. However, none of these variables show
   any predictive relationships with achievement, which suggests current
   federal policies, such as NCLB, are inappropriate and unlikely to lead
   to improvements in science education in the USA. In addition, students,
   teachers, and principals were found to perceive the school environment
   in very different ways, indicating further investigation of student
   culture is needed to determine appropriate changes that might lead to
   real improvements in achievement. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This article examines the merits of the proposition that design and
   inquiry are Conceptual parallels. It does so by first looking closely
   at the inquiry-related discourse within science education, then at
   aspects of the design discourse within engineering, and finally within
   technology education. Convergences and divergences of these two streams
   of curricular advocacy are then identified, and implications and
   conclusions with respect to curriculum and instruction in both subjects
   are suggested. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB To reduce curricular fragmentation in science education, reform
   recommendations include using common, unifying themes such as scaling
   to enhance curricular coherence. This study involved 215 participants
   from five groups (grades 5, 7, 9, and 12, and doctoral students), who
   completed written assessments and card sort tasks related to their
   conceptions of size and scale, and then completed individual
   interviews. Results triangulated from the data sources revealed the
   boundaries between and characteristics of scale size ranges that are
   well distinguished from each other for each group. Results indicate
   that relative size information was more readily understood than exact
   size, and significant size landmarks were used to anchor this
   relational web of scales. The nature of past experiences situated along
   two dimensions-from visual to kinesthetic in one dimension, and
   wholistic to sequential in the other-were shown to be key to scale
   cognition development. Commonalities and differences between the groups
   are highlighted and discussed. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Adopting a neo-Piagetian conceptual framework and a phenomenographic
   approach, we identified students' conceptual progression pattern on
   matter from elementary to high school. We interviewed 54 students from
   Grade I to Grade 10 chemistry on their conceptions of substances (i.e.,
   water, vinegar, and baking soda) and the combining of the substances.
   We found that progression of students' conceptions on matter from
   elementary to high school is multifaceted. For any aspect we examined,
   from spontaneous description of substances to chemical reaction of
   baking soda with vinegar, there was a unique progression pattern.
   Different conceptual progression patterns existed for different
   substances (i.e., water, baking soda, and vinegar) as well. Further,
   there is no clear conceptual leap between different grade levels in
   conceptual progression; that is, there is tremendous overlap in
   conceptions among students of different grades. (c) 2006 Wiley

AB Does collaborative learning in asynchronous discussion groups result in
   enhancing academic discourse and knowledge construction? This general
   research question has been researched in a study involving 300
   students, working during six months in 38 electronic discussion groups.
   The transcripts of the discussions were coded and analysed to test
   hypotheses related to the impact on knowledge construction. Coding of
   the units of analysis was based on the models of Fahy, P. J., Crawford,
   G., Ally, M., Cookson, P., Keller, V., & Prosser, F. (2000). The
   development and testing of a tool for analysis of computer mediated
   conferencing transcripts. Alberta Journal of Educational Research,

   Maastricht: McLuhan Institute, University of Maastricht. The results
   confirm that students in the discussion groups are very task-oriented
   and that higher proportions of high phases of knowledge construction
   are observed. Significant increases in the cognitive interaction,
   task-orientation and higher phases of knowledge construction are
   detected. Group size is a significant interaction variable. Discussion
   in smaller groups reflects larger proportions of higher levels of
   knowledge construction. The results point at the critical impact of
   structure in the task environment. In the discussion section,
   methodological issues are presented. The article concludes with
   directions for future research and some implications for instructional
   practice. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   CONTEXT
AB This study reports on the student experience of learning through
   writing in an undergraduate science subject. During their writing
   experience, 52 first year university science students used a writing
   database, bulletin board and word-processor. Using quantitative
   questionnaires developed from student learning research, this study
   investigates the quality of the approaches adopted by students to the
   use of the technologies and how this related to the quality of their
   whole experience and performance measures. The results show that
   students who adopted a surface or reproductive approach tended to
   achieve relatively poorer learning outcomes and lower performance
   measures than students who adopted approaches which reflected
   understanding. The findings have important implications for teachers
   introducing technologies into writing processes for the purpose of
   improving students' learning outcomes. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB This paper concerns the use of Information and Communications
   Technology (ICT) in music classrooms, with the focus on the secondary
   school music curriculum in the United Kingdom. In particular, it
   reports on a study of learners in a UK school using software designed
   to support practical music skills. The paper begins by briefly raising
   and summarising some key issues for the use of ICT in the UK music
   curriculum arising from current research and practice in music
   education. In this context the study is described, which was carried
   out in a British secondary school with 36 pupils in year 8 (aged
   approximate to 13). This study investigated whether a commercial CD-ROM
   entitled Teach Me Piano Deluxe, which was designed to teach music
   practical skills was able to support pupils' acquisition of music
   keyboard skills.
   The results showed that there was a significant improvement in reading
   music (staff) notation and rhythm skills. The study suggests that this
   is one of the ways in which ICT may be useful for learning practical
   music skills in the music classrooms. Such potential improvement in
   practical skills may, in turn, enable pupils to approach music-based
   activities Such as: composing, performing or listening in the
   classrooms, with greater confidence, a deeper level of understanding,
   and appreciation. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study tested the effectiveness of audio-vistial training in the
   discrimination of the phonetic feature of voicing on the recognition of
   written words by young children deemed to at risk of dyslexia
   (experiment 1) as well as on dyslexic children's phonological skills
   (experiment 2). In addition, the third experiment studied the
   effectiveness of this word recognition training in dyslexic children
   who regularly used a computer at home. A traditional pre-test,
   training, post-test design including comparison groups (experimental
   vs. control) provided a base-line for assessing the training effects.
   In the three experiments the intervention group showed higher increases
   performances in phonological skills and phonological recoding than the
   control group did. Beyond providing evidence for the effectiveness of
   this audiovisual training, these results contribute to an understanding
   of the nature of reading difficulties and successful training.
   Globally, the results show the impact of the audio-visual training
   about voicing on performances of reading-disabled children. A such type
   of training leads children to connect print and phonology. Phonological
   representations could be specified by training which involves both
   phonological and orthographic units. The mapping between these two
   units could be easier in a computerized remedial program. (c) 2004

AB We investigated whether the findings from worked-out example research
   on the effects of self-explanation prompts and on instructional
   explanations can be generalized to other example types - in this case:
   solved example problems. Whereas worked-out examples consist of a
   problem formulation, solution steps, and the final solution, solved
   example problems merely provide the problem formulation and the
   solution. We employed a first module of a computer-based environment
   for student teachers presenting solved example problems from which they
   learned how to select and to design worked-out examples for high school
   students. The participants (47 student teachers for German low- and
   medium-track schools and 33 student teachers for high-track schools)
   were randomly assigned to the cells of our 2 x 2 design (with vs.
   without self-explanation prompts; with vs. without instructional
   explanations). The effects of the different program versions on
   objective and subjective learning outcomes, on the perceived
   helpfulness of the program, and on the learning time were analyzed. As
   learning process data, the written and spoken self-explanations were
   assessed. The following main results were obtained: Particularly
   self-explanation prompts had favorable effects on learning outcomes,
   whereas instructional explanations can reduce the student teacher's
   self-explanation activities and thereby the learning outcomes. Whereas
   "objectively" the most favorable learning outcomes were obtained when
   only self-explanation prompts were employed, the student teachers
   perceived their learning outcome best when only instructional
   explanations were provided. It can be concluded that the status of
   self-explanation prompts and of instructional explanations is
   comparable irrespective of the example type presented for learning. (c)

   lifelong learning; fluency with IT; complex IT; domain-specific IT;

AB Previous research on IT fluency in connection with non-IT majors points
   at the increasing need for more "realistic" courses teaching the use of
   complex and domain-specific IT applications. That research also
   suggests certain desirable course design characteristics, of which one
   of the most important is the close integration of realistic case
   study-based material into one single course (as opposed to the less
   costly alternative of inserting single case study-based material into
   other courses). This paper describes a study in which the use of case
   study-based learning modules in an integrated way (i.e., as part of one
   main course) is compared against the use of those modules in isolation
   (i.e., inserted into other courses). The modules have been designed to
   teach complex and domain-specific IT applications in three main domains
   - anthropology, sociology, and chemistry. The study, which involved 76
   undergraduate students, suggests that the integration of modules into
   one single course, when compared with the option of using the modules
   in Isolation, significantly increased the level of perceptions of IT's
   potential for solving complex problems, perceived learning about
   specialized IT applications, and perceived learning about IT issues in
   general. The key conclusion of the study is that integration may be a
   desirable option regardless of the potential extra costs involved. (c)

AB Use of electronic teaching materials (e-material) to support teaching
   is a trend. e-Material design is therefore an important issue.
   Currently, most e-material providers offer a package of solutions for
   different purposes. However, not all teachers and learners need
   everything from a single package. A preferable alternative is to find
   useful material from different packages and combine them for a
   particular course. Currently, most educators collect the material
   manually, which is time-consuming and may result in missed material. In
   this paper, we describe a system - the Teaching-Material Design Center,
   which follows the standard of Sharable Content Object Reference Model -
   to separate e-material for use as teaching templates and learning
   objects and to label the material with use of semantic metadata for
   searching. This system can find existing teaching templates and
   learning objects for e-material designers and provide a convenient
   environment for constructing customized e-material for different
   requirements. We describe the implementation and evaluation of the
   proposed system for a course. Our system is efficient in finding
   teaching templates and learning objects and shortening the e-material
   development process. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper considers the challenges faced by those seeking to design
   effective blended learning. Using a 2-year case study involving cohorts
   of approximately 200 students, it demonstrates how Anthony Giddens'
   structuration theory can provide a metaframework for assisting
   educational designers in creating coherent blended learning experiences
   that reinforce intended learning outcomes. It calls for educational
   designers to be sensitive to both their audience and the unintended and
   unanticipated consequences of their actions and shows how a holistic
   annual review framework can reinforce or suppress emergent behaviour
   through unit development.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the longitudinal
   application of a suite of curriculum authoring tools (CATs) to
   inclusive classroom teaching practice in a secondary school setting.
   The study sought to establish whether the incorporation of the CATs
   into the teachers' curriculum development and implementation covaried
   with improved implementation integrity of classroom teaching practice
   over time. A repeated measures design was used to establish whether
   those teachers with high levels of tool use also recorded higher levels
   of implementation integrity in their use of specific inclusive teaching
   practices. The effects of the tools were measured using 578 50-minute
   classroom observations gathered over a 2.5-year period. The results
   indicated that higher levels of implementation integrity in classroom
   practice covaried with the extent to which the tools were used for the
   design and implementation of curriculum.

TI Technology affordances: the 'real story' in research with K-12 and
   undergraduate learners
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

ID COMPUTER-SIMULATION; STUDENTS; METAANALYSIS; INSTRUCTION;
   REPRESENTATIONS; MODELS; SKILLS
AB Computer technologies for learning environments have been introduced
   with great expectations for improved learning outcomes. However, the
   great improvements have not materialised; some of these extant studies
   are examined. Of all the explanations for these disappointing results,
   the least examined are the affordances of the computer tools. This
   paper provides a rationale for studying affordances and presents two
   studies in K-12 and undergraduate settings showing how powerful
   affordances are in affecting outcomes. Finally, the paper presents
   guidelines on how to gradually move students from a game affordance of
   a computer to a learning mode.

TI Gaming in a 3D multiuser virtual environment: engaging students in
   science lessons
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ENGAGEMENT; THINKING
AB Based on the exploratory study of a 3D multiuser virtual environment
   (3D MUVE), known as Quest Atlantis (QA), in a series of Primary Four
   (10- to 11-year-olds) Science lessons at Orchard Primary School in
   Singapore, this paper examines the issues of learning engagement and
   describes the socio-cultural context of QA's implementation. The
   students and teacher were observed during the lessons, interviewed
   after, and the completed quests were analysed to determine the level of
   engagement achieved. A pre- and posttest on the Science concepts
   covered was also administered. A seven-level taxonomy of engagement was
   used to provide the study with a more holistic perspective of
   engagement, together with the attempt to concretise the element of
   engagement into observable traits. Although there was a significant
   improvement of the posttest over the pretest, the level of engagement
   of the students was low (between 3 and 4). The lack of engagement might
   be a result of the distractions in the 3D MUVE, the students'
   difficulty with language used in the QA, their lack of computer
   competency for QA tasks, and/or their inability to complete the quests'
   section on reflections. The biggest challenges to the integration of QA
   into the Science curriculum were the interdependent issues of time (or
   lack of it) and 'buy-in' by the school and parents.

DT Article
ID COLOR-PREFERENCES
AB This study investigated graduate students' gender-specific preferences
   for certain website interface design features, intending to generate
   useful information for instructors in choosing and for website
   designers in creating educational websites. The features investigated
   in this study included colour value, major navigation buttons
   placement, and navigation mode. In this study, 56 graduate students in
   a north-eastern research university in the US volunteered to evaluate
   30 pairs of web page screenshots or website prototypes, and to indicate
   on the questionnaires their preferences within each pair of prototype.
   Each participant's preferences for the three features were coded and
   categorised for chi-square tests of independence to determine the
   relationships between gender and the investigated design features. The
   findings of gender effects on graduate students' preferences for the
   aforementioned features were presented and discussed.

TI A preliminary validation of attention, relevance, confidence and
   satisfaction model-based instructional material motivational survey in
   a computer-based tutorial setting
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID STRATEGIES; COURSES; GOALS
AB This paper describes a preliminary validation study of the
   Instructional Material Motivational Survey (IMMS) derived from the
   Attention, Relevance, Confidence and Satisfaction motivational design
   model. Previous studies related to the IMMS, however, suggest its
   practical application for motivational evaluation in various
   instructional settings without the support of empirical data. Moreover,
   there is a lack of discussion regarding the validity of the instrument.
   Therefore, this study empirically examined the IMMS as a motivational
   evaluation instrument. A computer-based tutorial setting was selected
   owing to its wide application in teaching large entry-level college
   courses. Data collected from 875 subjects were subjected to exploratory
   and confirmatory factor analyses, and measurement modelling LISREL.
   Findings suggested that 16 original items should be excluded from the
   IMMS; the retained 20 items were found to fall into different
   constructs, indicating that instructional features of the tutorial may
   influence the validity of the survey items. The implication of the
   study supports the situational feature of the IMMS. Therefore, a
   preevaluation adjustment on the IMMS items is recommended to identify
   suitable items before the full motivational evaluation. Future research
   should focus on the further validation of the IMMS based on this
   preliminary evidence.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB With the proliferation of computers in test delivery today, adaptive
   testing has become quite popular, especially when examinees must be
   classified into two categories (pass/fail, master/nonmaster). Several
   well-established organisations have provided standards and guidelines
   for the design and evaluation of educational and psychological testing.
   The purpose of this paper was not to repeat the guidelines and
   standards that exist in the literature but to identify and discuss the
   main evaluation parameters for a computer-adaptive test (CAT). A number
   of parameters should be taken into account when evaluating CAT. Key
   parameters include utility, validity, reliability, satisfaction,
   usability, reporting, administration, security, and thoseassociated
   with adaptivity, item pool, and psychometric theory. These parameters
   are presented and discussed below and form a proposed evaluation model,
   Evaluation Model of Computer-Adaptive Testing.

TI Rethinking the nature of online work in asynchronous learning networks
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID METACOGNITION
AB Research on asynchronous learning networks (ALNs) has indicated that
   there are problems with both the quantity and quality of online
   interactions that can undermine the aim of inquiry. The goal of this
   paper is to offer a new way of thinking about these problems in the
   context of knowledge building, a specific form of collaborative inquiry
   supported by an ALN. Drawing from interviews with teachers following
   two teacher education courses that introduced teachers to knowledge
   building, it is argued that we need to rethink the role and purpose of
   online work in ALNs-as building a communal learning resource. A
   framework for doing this is proposed in terms of three notions:
   collaboration, learning how to learn and idea improvement. The
   framework is expected to contribute to the literature on knowledge
   building by providing a new way to distinguish knowledge building from
   other forms of collaborative inquiry.

ID SCIENTIFIC LITERACY; VIEWS; CONCEPTIONS; INSTRUCTION; KNOWLEDGE
AB This study investigates the proximal and distal images of the nature of
   science (NOS) that A-level students develop from their participation in
   chemistry laboratory work. We also explored the nature of the
   interactions among the students' proximal and distal images of the NOS
   and students' participation in laboratory work. Students' views of the
   NOS and the nature of their chemistry laboratory work were elicited
   through students' responses to an open-ended questionnaire and
   semistructured interviews. The results suggest that students build some
   understandings of the NOS from their participation in laboratory work.
   Students' proximal NOS understandings appear to build into and interact
   with their understandings of the nature and practice of professional
   science. This interaction appears to be mediated by the nature of
   instruction. It is posited that each student's conceptual ecological
   system is replete with interactions, which govern attenuation of
   proximal understandings into distal images. Methodologically, the study
   illustrates how students' laboratory work-based proximal and distal
   images of the NOS can be identified and extracted through analyzing and
   interpreting their responses to protocols. Implications for A-level
   Chemistry instruction and curriculum development are raised. (c) 2006

ID STUDENTS CONCEPTIONS; INTRODUCTORY PHYSICS; CLASSICAL MECHANICS;
   ELECTRICITY
AB Croatian 1st-year and 3rd-year high-school students (N = 170) completed
   a conceptual physics test. Students were evaluated with regard to two
   physics topics: Newtonian dynamics and simple DC circuits. Students
   answered test items and also indicated their confidence in each answer.
   Rasch analysis facilitated the calculation of three linear measures:
   (a) an item-difficulty measure based upon all responses, (b) an
   item-confidence measure based upon correct student answers, and (c) an
   item-confidence measure based upon incorrect student answers.
   Comparisons were made with regard to item difficulty and item
   confidence. The results suggest that Newtonian dynamics is a topic with
   stronger students' alternative conceptions than the topic of DC
   circuits, which is characterized by much lower students' confidence on
   both correct and incorrect answers. A systematic and significant
   difference between mean student confidence on Newtonian dynamics and DC
   circuits items was found in both student groups. Findings suggest some
   steps for physics instruction in Croatia as well as areas of further
   research for those in science education interested in additional
   techniques of exploring alternative conceptions. (c) 2005 Wiley

AB The role of science education in rural development is of great interest
   to science educators. In this study I investigated how residents of
   rural Kirumi, Kenya, approach health and healing, through discussions
   and semistructured and in-depth interviews with 150 residents, 3 local
   herbalists, and 2 medical researchers over a period of 6 months. I
   constructed objects of learning by looking for similarities and
   differences within interpretive themes. Objects of teaming found
   comprise four types of personal learning tools, three types of
   relational learning tools, three genres of moral obligation, and five
   genres of knowledge guarding. Findings show that rural people use
   (among other learning tools) inner sensing to engage thought processes
   that lead to health and healing knowledge. The sociocultural context is
   also an important component in learning. Inner sensing and residents'
   sociocultural context are not presently emphasized in Kenyan science
   teaching. I discuss the potential use of rural objects of learning in
   school science, with specific reference to a health topic in the Kenyan
   science curriculum. In addition, the findings add to the literature in
   the Science, Technology, Society, and Environment (STSE) approach to

ID CONCEPTUAL CHANGE
AB This study examined the views, and the retention of these views, of 19
   preservice elementary teachers as they learned about nature of science
   (NOS). The preservice teachers participated in a cohort group as they
   took a science methods course during which they received explicit
   reflective instruction in nature of science. Through Views of Nature of
   Science version B (VNOS-B) surveys and interviews it was found that
   most preservice teachers held inadequate ideas of nature of science
   prior to instruction, but improved their views after one semester of
   instruction in the science methods course. However, 5 months after
   instruction, the graduate preservice teachers were again interviewed
   and it was found that several of the students reverted back to their
   earlier views. The results are interpreted through Perry's scheme, and
   implications and recommendations for elementary science teacher
   education are made. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID SCHOOL CHEMISTRY TEXTBOOKS; SCIENTIFIC LITERACY; CONCEPTUAL CHANGE;
   EDUCATION; TEACHERS; COMMUNITIES; INSTRUCTION; PERSPECTIVE; TEXTS
AB The use of trade books in science instruction, particularly in the
   elementary and middle school grades, invites scrutiny into the ways in
   which trade books represent science and its practitioners to learners.
   Forty-four trade books were examined for their explicit and implicit
   representations of science. The majority of the sample was comprised of
   informational texts, followed by experiment books and artistic books.
   Scientific knowledge was generally represented as facts, with limited
   connections to the producers of those facts. Scientists and their
   practice were represented as experiment or observation, in descriptions
   that blurred the distinctions between levels of participation in
   science, and emphasized empirical data collection over analysis or
   theory development. Artistic books focused on nature encouraged an
   aesthetic approach to nature, primarily through creative observation.
   These books are not likely to convey a sophisticated image of the
   nature of science to young children without contextualization by
   teachers and other knowledgeable adults. However, they have potential
   as tools within inquiry contexts, if used in a manner authentic to
   goals for scientific literacy. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB A ' learning design' is defined as the description of the
   teaching-learning process that takes place in a unit of learning (eg, a
   course, a lesson or any other designed learning event). The key
   principle in learning design is that it represents the learning
   activities and the support activities that are performed by different
   persons (learners, teachers) in the context of a unit of learning. The
   IMS Learning Design specification aims to represent the learning design
   of units of learning in a semantic, formal and machine interpretable
   way. Since its release in 2003 various parties have been active to
   develop tools, to experiment with Learning Design in practice, or to do
   research on the further advancement of the specification. The aim of
   this special issue is to provide an overview of current work in the
   area. This papers introduces Learning Design, analyses the different
   papers and provides an overview of current research in Learning Design.
   The major research issues are at the moment: a) the use of ontologies
   and semantic web principles & tools related to Learning Design; b) the
   use of learning design patterns; c) the development of learrning design
   authoring and content management systems, and d) the development of
   learning design players, including the issues how to use the integrated
   set of learning design tools in a variety of settings.

ID SEMANTIC WEB
AB The paper describes an ontology- based framework for bridging learning
   design and learning object content. In present solutions, researchers
   have proposed conceptual models and developed tools for both of those
   subjects, but without detailed discussions of how they can be used
   together. In this paper we advocate the use of ontologies to explicitly
   specify all learning designs, learning objects, and the relations
   between them, and show how this use of ontologies can result in more
   effective (semi-) automatic tools and services that increase the level
   of reusability. We first define a three-part conceptual model that
   introduces an intermediate level between learning design and learning
   objects called the learning object context. We then use ontologies to
   facilitate the representation of these concepts: LOCO is a new ontology
   based on IMS-LD, ALOCoM is an existing ontology for learning objects,
   and LOCO-Cite is a new ontology for the learning object contextual
   model. We conclude by showing the applicability of the proposed
   framework in a use case study.

DE IMS learning design; ontologies; semantic description; formal axioms
AB In this paper, we present an ontology to represent the semantics of the
   IMS Learning Design (IMS LD) specification, a meta- language used to
   describe the main elements of the learning design process. The
   motivation of this work relies on the expressiveness limitations found
   on the current XML-Schema implementation of the IMS LD conceptual
   model. To solve these limitations, we have developed an ontology using
   Protege at the knowledge level. In addition, we provide its
   implementation in OWL, the standard language of the Semantic Web, and
   the set of associated axioms in first-order logic.

DE IMS-LD; CSCL; learning flow; patterns; authoring tool
AB This paper introduces Collage, a high-level IMS-LD compliant authoring
   tool that is specialized for CSCL (Computer-Supported Collaborative
   Learning). Nowadays CSCL is a key trend in e-learning since it
   highlights the importance of social interactions as an essential
   element of learning. CSCL is an interdisciplinary domain, which demands
   participatory design techniques that allow teachers to get directly
   involved in design activities. Developing CSCL designs using LD is a
   difficult task for teachers since LD is a complex technical
   specification and modelling collaborative characteristics can be
   tricky. Collage helps teachers in the process of creating their own
   potentially effective collaborative Learning Designs by reusing and
   customizing patterns, according to the requirements of a particular
   learning situation. These patterns, called Collaborative Learning Flow
   Patterns (CLFPs), represent best practices that are repetitively used
   by practitioners when structuring the flow of (collaborative) learning
   activities. An example of an LD that can be created using Collage is
   illustrated in the paper. Preliminary evaluation results show that
   teachers with experience in CL but without LD knowledge, can
   successfully design real collaborative learning experiences using
   Collage.

DE adaptive e-learning; learning technology standards; IMS-LD; authoring;
   life cycle model; agents
AB The objective of this paper is to introduce a standards-based model for
   adaptive e- learning and to investigate the conditions and tools
   required by authors to implement this model. Adaptation in the context
   of e-learning is about creating a learner experience that purposely
   adjusts to various conditions over a period of time with the intention
   of increasing pre-defined success criteria. Adaptation can be based on
   an initial design, runtime information or, as in the aLFanet system, a
   combination. Adaptation requires the functionality to be able to
   interact with and manipulate data on the learning design, the users and
   the system and its contents. Therefore, adaptation is not an add- on
   that can just be plugged into a learning environment. Each of the
   conditions for adaptation have to be represented in a rigorous way. We
   will introduce a model based on a set of key learning technology
   standards that enables a structured, integrated view on designing,
   using and validating adaptation. For the author however, it appeared
   that the model is demanding both through the requirements imposed by
   the adaptation and the use of standards. We will discuss their
   experiences in applying it, analyse the steps already taken to tackle
   the complexity and come with additional suggestions to move forward to
   implementations suitable for a wider audience.

AB The DIN Didactical Object Model extends the approaches of existing
   Educational Modeling Languages introducing specifications for contexts
   and experiences. In this paper, we show how the Didactical Object Model
   can be used for sharing didactical expertise. Educational Modeling
   Languages change the design paradigm from content orientation towards
   process-/ activity orientation. Especially in the community of teachers
   and didactical designers, this development has gained attention.
   However, reusing learning scenarios requires applying knowledge
   management concepts to this issue. To adequately reuse learning
   scenarios, information about context and experiences must become
   available. Furthermore, supporting human-oriented knowledge management
   instruments are needed to facilitate the exchange and reuse process.
   The DIN Didactical Object Model, developed by the German Standards Body
   (Deutsches Institut fur Normung, DIN e. V.), provides specifications
   for this. Additionally, an integrative concept for knowledge sharing
   and reuse is presented: the solution integrates business, learning, and
   knowledge processes into a common architecture using the Didactical
   Object Model to exchange scenarios. The presented modeling language
   will enhance the use of Educational Modeling Languages towards
   knowledge- based exchange of learning scenarios and experience sharing.

AB This chapter states and explains that a Learning Design is the result
   of a knowledge engineering process where knowledge and competencies,
   learning design and delivery models are constructed in an integrated
   framework. We present a general graphical language and a knowledge
   editor that has been adapted to support the construction of learning
   designs compliant with the IMS- LD specification. We situate LD within
   our taxonomy of knowledge models as a multi-actor collaborative system.
   We move up one step in the abstraction scale, showing that the process
   of constructing learning designs can itself be viewed as a
   unit-of-learning (or a "unit-of-design"): designers can be seen as
   learning by constructing learning designs, individually, in teams and
   with staff support. This viewpoint enables us to discuss and compare
   various "design plays". Further, the issue of representing knowledge,
   cognitive skills and competencies is addressed. The association between
   these "content" models and learning design components can guide the
   construction of learning designs and help to classify them in
   repositories of LD templates.

AB Tools to support teachers and learning technologists in the creation of
   effective learning designs are currently in their infancy. This paper
   describes a metadata model, devised to assist in the conception and
   design of new learning activities, that has been developed, used and
   evaluated over a period of three years. The online tool that embodies
   this model was not originally intended to produce runtime executable
   code such as IMS-LD, but rather focussed on assisting teachers in the
   thought processes involved in selecting appropriate methods, tools,
   student activities and assessments to suit the required learning
   objectives. Subsequently, we have modified the RELOAD editor such that
   the output from our tool can be translated into IMS-LD. The
   contribution of this paper is the comparison of our data model with
   that of IMS-LD, and the analysis of how each can inform the other.

AB In this paper, the authors describe a mechanism for the introduction of
   small variations in the original learning design process defined in a
   particular Unit of Learning (UoL). The objective is to increase the UoL
   reusability by offering the designers an alternative to introduce
   slight variations on the original design instead of creating a new one
   each time they want to reuse it. No changes or extensions to the
   Learning Design definition are required to perform these modifications.
   The use of design patterns to include the adaptations offers the
   possibility to easily introduce new operations, such as tracing the
   activity progress, for instance. The structure of a Learning Design
   player that is able to process the desired adaptation information and
   to apply it at runtime will be outlined. The player will be part of an
   architecture for the automatic adaptation of UoLs to their actual
   context of execution.

DE Learning Design; service descriptions
AB This paper examines the contention that learning environments which use
   IMS Learning Designs can be created by plugging in different
   components, using generic service descriptions to create the interface
   between the Learning Design (LD) and the specific tools. There is an
   alternative viewpoint which claims that generic service descriptions
   cannot provide the richness required to fully utilize Learning Design.
   The paper describes the work performed in the SLeD project by the UK
   Open University and the Open University of the Netherlands. The SLeD
   project suggests a compromise between the two viewpoints by using
   generic service descriptions, but recognizing the nature of the current
   environment through the use of translators, which interact with
   specific instantiations of services.

DE blended learning; learning environment; IMS Learning Design in
   practice; runtime environment for IMS learning design; Moodle
AB Starting from the first public draft of IMS Learning Design in November
   2002, a research project at the Catholic University
   Eichstaett-Ingolstadt in Germany was dedicated to the conceptual
   examination and empirical review of IMS Learning Design Level A. A
   prototypical runtime environment called 'lab005' was developed. It was
   built based on Moodle, a web-based, open source course management
   system. Development and use of the lab005 runtime environment were
   intensely evaluated. Several university courses provided a use case for
   the empirical review of IMS Learning Design, which covered mainly two
   issues: firstly, whether IMS Learning Design can be used to support
   mixed mode learning scenarios (use for blended learning), and secondly,
   how users interact in learning situations with a learning environment
   for IMS Learning Design (usability in terms of human-computer
   interaction). This article gives an overview of the web-based learning
   environment lab005, its underlying concepts and outcomes of
   experimental use and evaluation. Though limited in scope, the
   successful implementation of IMS Learning Design in higher education
   proves the possibility to support mixed mode learning scenarios. Key
   concepts for the graphical user interface of lab005 are illustrated in
   order to give insights into the use of IMS Learning Design in mixed
   mode learning scenarios. Details in the results of evaluation concern
   the classification of learning objects, the use of environment as an
   element in IMS Learning Design and challenges in the application with
   face-to-face situations and with real life objects in classroom
   learning scenarios.

AB A ubiquitous learning environment provides an interoperable, pervasive,
   and seamless learning architecture to connect, integrate, and share
   three major dimensions of learning resources: learning collaborators,
   learning contents, and learning services. Ubiquitous learning is
   characterized by providing intuitive ways for identifying right
   learning collaborators, right learning contents and right learning
   services in the right place at the right time. Our context aware
   ubiquitous learning environment consists of three systems, namely
   peer-to-peer content access and adaptation system, personalized
   annotation management system, and multimedia real-time group discussion
   system. Since the effectiveness and efficiency of ubiquitous learning
   heavily relies on learners' surrounding context, in this paper, we will
   address a context model and context acquisition mechanism for
   collecting contextual information at run time. We have built a context
   aware ubiquitous learning environment and in this paper we will address
   how this newly designed environment can fully support the needs of
   peer-to-peer collaborative learning.

AB A recent research and development project conducted at the University
   of the South Pacific (USP) examined how educational multimedia can be
   built according to the learning approaches of the region. Through
   interviews, questionnaires and usability tests with staff and students
   at USP, the research team drafted a set of recommendations for the
   development of educational multimedia in the region. They then built an
   interactive CD-rom based on these recommendations. This paper focuses
   on the results related to cultural context, and the directions they
   indicate for educational multimedia developers in the South Pacific.
   Specifically, the study found that Distance and Flexible Learning (DFL)
   materials do not generally provide the cultural context that staff and
   students desire at USP, as they rarely utilize local metaphors,
   examples or Vernacular language. The paper presents approaches
   developed during the project to provide cultural context in two
   categories: decentralised and dialogic contextualisation. Through
   decentralised contextualization tools such as a Wiki or digital
   scrapbook, students are encouraged to provide their own cultural
   context to the learning materials. Dialogic contextualisation tools
   such as virtual peers and interactive quizzes can provide cultural
   context in a more conversational, personified, and centralised manner.
   These ideas are illustrated with specific examples of educational
   multimedia projects, so that they can be easily replicated and modified
   by educational multimedia developers in their own contexts.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine academic department chair
   perceptions about the future influence of web-based distance education
   on departmental operations and their changing role as academic leader.
   Using a rating, modified-policy Delphi method, the researcher worked
   with 22 department chairs employed at public, urban universities in the
   United States to develop 76 factor statements about the opportunities,
   pressures, changing relationships, and role of the chair. In a
   three-step process, the chairs reduced the 76 factors into 29
   predictive statements. Furthermore, the researcher merged the
   predictions into six themes covering topics such as the importance of
   external agencies to the successful implementation of web-based
   education and concerns about future funding. Based on the findings, the
   researcher argued that the most efficient strategies to promote
   web-based distance education are through the efforts of the department
   chair due to the closer proximity of the department to external markets.

DE IMS Learning Design; Open specifications; lesson plan; educational

ID UNITS
AB The IMS Learning Design specification (LD) was introduced as an answer
   to the shortcomings of existing learning technology specifications. The
   main difference with existing specifications is that LD is an abstract,
   conceptual model that is able to express various pedagogical approaches
   whereby content can be adapted to personal needs and assessments can be
   integrated. In this article we evaluate the pedagogical expressiveness
   of LD by taking a set of 16 lesson plans and expressing them in LD. We
   use three different methods to identify difficulties in expressing the
   lesson plans in LD. Difficulties identified included circulating a
   document within a group, giving instructions prior to the start of an
   activity, random assignment of a group member to a role, group
   formation at runtime, creation of an inventory to map pre-knowledge,
   learning objectives and learning achievements, and a way to communicate
   information on how to deliver a lesson to a teacher. We did not find
   situations that were impossible to express with LD. The difficulties
   found are elaborated and suggestions to handle them are given. The
   methods used are compared and suggestions are given for further
   research.

AB This paper presents findings from the pattern of participation and
   discourse analysis of the online interaction among in-service teachers
   in the teacher training institute in Singapore. It was found that the
   teachers formed a knowledge-building community and jointly discussed
   issues related to integrating information technology into the
   classroom. There was evidence that teachers formed a socially cohesive
   community and their participations were active. However it was found
   that in-depth and sustainable online interaction were lacking. The
   authors suggest searching for ways to promote deep and sustainable
   online interaction, especially in terms of getting participants to
   detect the gap in ideas and challenging assumptions.

DE learning portfolio analysis; SCORM; data mining; personalized learning

ID DATA CUBE TECHNOLOGY; COMPUTERS; STUDENTS; GENDER
AB With vigorous development of the Internet, e-learning system has become
   more and more popular. Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM)
   2004 provides the Sequencing and Navigation (SN) Specification to
   define the course sequencing behavior, control the sequencing,
   selecting and delivering of course, and organize the content into a
   hierarchical structure, namely Activity Tree. Therefore, how to provide
   customized course according to individual learning characteristics and
   capabilities, and how to create, represent and maintain the activity
   tree with appropriate associated sequencing definition for different
   learners become two important issues. However, it is almost impossible
   to design personalized learning activities trees for each learner
   manually. The information of learning behavior, called learning
   portfolio, can help teacher understand the reason why a learner got
   high or low grade. Thus, in this paper, we propose a Learning Portfolio
   Mining (LPM) Approach including four phases: 1. User Model Definition
   Phase: define the learner profile based upon existing articles and
   pedagogical theory. 2. Learning Pattern Extraction Phase: apply
   sequential pattern mining technique to extract the maximal frequent
   learning patterns from the learning sequence, transform original
   learning sequence into a bit vector, and then use distance based
   clustering approach to group learners with good learning performance
   into several clusters. 3. Decision Tree Construction Phase: use two
   third of the learner profiles with corresponding cluster labels as
   training data to create a decision tree, and the remainings are the
   testing data. 4. Activity Tree Generation Phase: use each created
   cluster including several learning patterns as sequencing rules to
   generate personalized activity tree with associated sequencing rules of
   SN. Finally, for evaluating our proposed approach of learning portfolio
   analysis, an experiment has been done and the results show that
   generated personalized activity trees with sequencing rules are
   workable and beneficial for learners.

AB This article tells the story of the design, development and
   presentation of eighteen months of coursework for a Master's degree
   programme in Computer-Integrated education at the Sudan University of
   Science and Technology in Khartoum from 2002 to 2004. The focus is on
   what was learnt in adapting a programme presented at the University of
   Pretoria to cope with the challenges of teaching at an institution
   thousands of kilometres away, where technological infrastructure, time
   and policy issues; and even the weather played an often disruptive
   role. The data sources from which the story is constructed are field
   notes and preparation material, the project diary, informal discussion
   both physical and online; interviews and email messages with students,
   local facilitators, local administrators and presenters; as well as the
   electronic artefacts produced by the students. A comparison between a
   synthesis of the literature and the narrative description leads to the
   identification of seven assumptions that may guide the design,
   development and presentation of international, cross cultural
   Internet-supported teaching initiatives.

AB This paper reports an investigation of cognitive styles, achievement
   scores and attitudes toward computers among university students. Field
   dependence/field independence is a dimension of cognitive style that
   has been researched with various student groups as well as with
   attitudes. Nevertheless, there appears to be a dearth of published
   research in this area relevant to teacher trainees in an international
   setting. In this study, the standardised Group Embedded Figures Test
   was used to assess field dependency among 130 teacher trainees.
   Overall, it was found that there was no significant relationship
   between cognitive styles and academic achievement (r=.14, p=.15);
   cognitive styles and attitudes toward computers (r =.01, p=.84); and,
   cognitive styles and attitudes toward computers when their academic
   achievement scores were covariated (F(2,126) =.40, p >.05). The
   findings indicate that students' attitudes toward computers are not
   associated with field dependency, even when their achievement levels
   were controlled. Attitude toward computers is found to function
   independently from cognitive styles.

   on the construct and subsequently applied to the content analysis of
   the transcripts of eight student participants in an online discussion.
   The model, which included four critical thinking processes, their
   descriptions and indicators, proved effective for the identification

AB Teachers' perceptions are critical to the success or failure of
   integrating computer games with educational features into classrooms.
   Consequently, it is essential to gather information about concerns they
   might have in regard to using these games in the classroom. This study
   was conducted to investigate the perceptions and future plans of a
   group of prospective computer teachers in Turkey. One-hundred sixteen
   students, from four different universities' Computer Education and
   Instructional Technology (CEIT) departments, participated in this
   study. The results of the study reveal that the prospective computer
   teachers who participated have positive perceptions regarding the use
   of computer games with educational features in education. Moreover,
   most of the participants plan to use such games in their future
   professions, according to their responses. However, some of the
   participants have doubts, especially concerning the issues of classroom
   management and the educational effectiveness of computer games
   currently on the market.

AB This study examines the reliability of automatic speech recognition
   (ASR) software used to teach English pronunciation, focusing on one
   particular piece of software, FluSpeak, as a typical example.
   Thirty-six Korean English as a Foreign Language (EFL) college students
   participated in an experiment in which they listened to 15 sentences
   that appeared in FluSpeak and recorded their voices, repeating sentence
   by sentence. The ASR software analysis of their production was then
   compared to pronunciation scores determined by native English speaking
   (NES) instructors. Although the correlation coefficient for intonation
   was nearly zero, indicating that ASR technology is still not as
   accurate as human analysis, the software may be very useful for student
   practice with aspects of pronunciation. The paper suggests a lesson
   plan for teaching English pronunciation through ASR software.

AB This paper provides guidelines for designing metacognitive maps in
   web-based learning environments. A metacognitive map is a visual
   interface-based tool that supports metacognition throughout the entire
   learning process. Inspired by the four key metacognitive skills of
   planning, monitoring, evaluating, and revising, the metacognitive map
   is composed of two sub-maps ( global and local tracking maps) and a
   planning space for learning processes/tasks. Metacognitive support is
   embedded within these visual on-screen maps and planning space.

AB A recent focus in web based learning systems has been the development
   of reusable learning materials that can be delivered as personalized
   courses depending of a number of factors such as the user's background,
   his/her learning preferences, current knowledge based on previous
   assessments, or previous browsing patterns. The student is often
   confronted with complex information mining tasks in which the semantics
   of individual sources require a deeper modelling than is offered by
   current learning systems. Most authored content exist in the form of
   videos, audio, slides, text, and simulations. In the absence of
   suitable annotations, the conversion of such materials for on-line
   distribution, presentation, and personalization has proven to be
   difficult. Based on our experiences with Open Courseware (OCW) and
   Singapore-MIT Alliance (SMA) video database, this paper presents a
   personalized delivery system that uses a domain ontology and
   pedagogical models to compose course materials in response to a user's
   query. We also present several important E-learning applications
   emerging from the framework.

TI Modeling students modeling abilities: The teaching and learning of
   complex systems in education
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB The word Tao usually is translated as way or path, but it refers to the
   deep structure of patterns and regularities beneath surface-level
   experiences. Similarly, Taoists use the terms naming or telling to
   refer to nearly any formal statement, proposition, or rule. So, for our
   purposes here, a particularization of Lao Tsu's famous saying might be:
   The structure of things that can be reduced to a formal statement,
   proposition, or rule is not the true structure of things.... This is,
   or should be, the central challenge that confronts learning scientists
   who hope to create models of the models (and/or underlying conceptual
   systems) that students develop to make sense of complex systems that
   occur in their lives. The challenge occurs because of the following
   mismatch. On the one hand, many currently prevailing cognitive science
   theories continue to rely implicitly (if not explicitly) on mechanistic
   information processing metaphors in which everything that students know
   is reduced to lists of condition-action rules. On the other hand, the
   most fundamental (systemic) characteristics of complex systems cannot
   be explained (or modeled) using only a single function-or even a list
   of functions; they arise from interactions among, lower
   order/rule-governed agents-which function simultaneously and
   continuously, and which are not simply inert objects waiting to be
   activated by some external source. It is here where I think learning
   scientists could really have an impact, especially in understanding how
   to teach and learn about complex systems.

TI Sharing solutions: Persistence and grounding in multimodal
   collaborative problem solving
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article reports on an exploratory study of the relationship
   between grounding and problem solving in multimodal computer-mediated
   collaboration. This article examines two different media, a shared
   whiteboard and a MOO environment that includes a text chat facility. A
   study was done on how the acknowledgment rate (how often partners give
   feedback of having perceived, understood, and accepted partner's
   contributions) varies according to the media and the content of
   interactions.
   It was expected that the whiteboard would serve to draw schemata that
   disambiguate chat utterances. Instead, results show that the whiteboard
   is primarily used to represent the state of problem solving and the
   chat is used for grounding information created on the whiteboard. These
   results are interpreted in terms of persistence: More persistent
   information is exchanged through the more persistent medium. The
   whiteboard was used as a shared memory rather than a grounding tool.

AB Students often hold strong attitudes regarding topics they encounter
   during their studies.. and many instructors feel that these attitudes
   can have strong effects on students' performance. We. characterized
   students' attitudes toward evolution and investigated the influence of
   students' attitudes (precourse and post-course) regarding evolution on
   their performance in an evolution course, measured as their final
   grade. We found our students to hold positive attitudes toward
   evolution; these attitudes became more positive following the course.
   The most significant change in attitude occurred in the group of
   students initially undecided toward evolution. We also found that
   attitudes prior to the course had little influence on later
   achievement; however, at the end of the course, students' attitudes
   were positively related to final grades, although the effect was small.
   We argue that pedagogical techniques directly addressing students'
   attitudes help reduce the influence of attitudes (especially prior
   attitudes) on achievement. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID INSTRUCTION
AB Considerable research has compared how students learn science from
   computer simulations with how they learn from "traditional" classes.
   Little research has compared how students learn science from computer
   simulations with how they learn from direct experience in the real
   environment on which the simulations are based. This study compared two
   college classes studying introductory oceanography. One class learned
   using an interactive computer simulation based on a dynamic,
   three-dimensional model of physical oceanography. The other class
   learned by spending a day on a research ship using scientific tools and
   instruments to measure physical properties of the ocean directly. In
   classes preceding and following the simulation or field experience,
   students performed the same exercises regarding currents and salinity,
   had the same instructor presentations, and did the same homework. The
   study found that the field experience helped contextualize learning for
   students with little prior experience of the ocean while the simulation
   made it easier for students to connect what they learned from it to
   other content they learned in class. These and other findings shed
   light on what computer simulations can and cannot help students team,
   and what concepts are best learned in the real environment. (c) 2005

AB Based on studies carried out on qualitative data an instrument was
   constructed for investigating how larger numbers of students handle
   graphics. This test, consisting of 18 pages, each with its own graphic
   display(s) and a set of tasks, was distributed to 363 students, 15-16
   years of age, from five different schools. The format of the questions
   varied, as did the format of the graphics. As students' performance was
   expected to be multidimensional, confirmatory factor analysis was
   carried out with a structural equation modeling technique. In addition
   to the identification of a general graphicacy-test factor (Gen) and an
   end-of-test effect (End'), a narrative dimension (Narr') was vaguely
   indicated. This model was then related to a six-factor model of
   students' formal academic achievement measured by their leaving
   certificates from compulsory education. The strongest correlation
   obtained was between the general graphicacy-test dimension (Gen) and a
   mathematic/science factor (MathSc') in the grades model. In addition,
   substantial relationships were detected between the Gen factor and both
   an overall school achievement factor (SchAch) and a language factor
   (Lang') in the grades model. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This case study characterizes the inscriptional practices demonstrated
   by seventh graders, particularly their use of data tables and graphs,
   in an inquiry-based learning environment. Using a naturalistic
   approach, we collected multiple sources of data during an 8-month
   instructional unit that emphasized water quality and relevant concepts.
   The analyses show that constructing and interpreting Graphs and tables
   provided students with opportunities to discuss, review, and clarify
   questions about concepts and the inquiry process. At the end of the
   unit on water quality, students were capable of fully participating in
   designing a more complicated inscription and interpreting new
   inscriptions. The findings suggest that four features of the learning
   environment promoted the development of inscriptional practices: (1)
   embedding the use of inscriptions in students' science inquiry; (2)
   providing scaffolds to support students' inquiry process; (3)
   sequencing tasks and the inquiry process; and (4) engaging students in
   science inquiry in an iterated manner. This study provides insight into
   the design of a learning environment in which students can develop
   competent scientific practices. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID EDUCATION; LITERACY; STUDENTS; CULTURE
AB This investigation explores how underrepresented urban students made
   sense of their first experience with high school science. The study
   sought to identify how students' assimilation into the science
   classroom reflected their interpretation of science itself in relation
   to their academic identities. The primary objectives were to examine
   students' responses to the epistemic, behavioral, and discursive norms
   of the science classroom. At the completion of the academic year, 29
   students were interviewed regarding their experiences in a ninth and
   tenth-grade life science course. The results indicate that students
   experienced relative ease in appropriating the epistemic and cultural
   behaviors of science, whereas they expressed a great deal of difficulty
   in appropriating the discursive practices of science. The implications
   of these findings reflect the broader need to place greater emphasis on
   the relationship between students' identity and their scientific
   literacy development. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

DT Article
ID SCIENCE-EDUCATION; INQUIRY; QUESTIONS; MODEL
AB This case study involved year 9 students carrying out project work in
   biology via problem-based learning. The purpose of the study was to (a)
   find out how students approach and work through ill-structured
   problems, (b) identify some issues and challenges related to the use of
   such problems, and (c) offer some practical suggestions on the
   implementation of problem-based project work. Data sources included
   observation and field notes, students' written documents, audiotapes
   and videotapes of students at work, and student interviews. The
   findings showed that several students initially experienced
   difficulties in identifying a problem themselves but after discussing
   with family and friends, were able to overcome this initial barrier and
   subsequently formulated personally meaningful problems for
   investigation. The ill-structured problems stimulated students to pose
   questions which charted their courses of action, leading to independent
   inquiry. Students were led to investigate multidisciplinary elements
   beyond the boundaries of typical school science, and also learned about
   different modes of inquiry. The issues and challenges identified
   included identifying a problem for investigation; asking questions to
   negotiate the learning pathway; deciding what areas to pursue, given a
   multitude of possibilities; and figuring out how to extract relevant
   information from the available mass. Implications of the findings for
   instructional practice are discussed. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Complex dilemmas of identity and practice
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SUBJECT-MATTER; TEACHER; SCIENCE; INQUIRY
AB Identity is a complex construct, yet extremely important if we wish to
   understand the practice of teaching as a profession. In this paper, we
   examine the ways two middle school teachers talk about their identity
   and teaching practices and coordinate these self-reports with our own
   observations of how they implement a new environmental science
   curriculum. More specifically, we compare the teachers' beliefs about
   learning, goals for the classroom community and for instruction, and
   their knowledge of science content, and pedagogy. Furthermore, we
   discuss teaching dilemmas, which arise for these teachers as their
   identities and practices intersect and at times conflict. We argue,
   however, that a focus on practice and outcomes is an important, but
   limited aspect of what we, as a field, need to consider when attempting
   to understand the complexities of teaching and learning. Therefore, we
   continue to expand our understanding of two science classrooms as we
   examine the teachers' multiple identities in relation to their
   implementation of a science curriculum. The identity portraits from
   this study provide a rich and complicated account of the implementation
   of a science curriculum and illuminate a number of potential obstacles
   and pitfalls, which may inform the way we as a field reflect on
   curriculum and professional development. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals,

AB This paper examines the use of students' lived experiences in an urban
   elementary science classroom. Students bring different funds of
   knowledge that are accumulated through their lived experiences into the
   classroom, and I examine what those funds of knowledge mean to an
   elementary science teacher working in an urban school. I describe how a
   female elementary teacher integrates her life experiences with that of
   her students, and utilizes those experiences to teach meaningful
   science. This paper also discusses what it means to students when their
   lived experiences are the part of science learning. 1 also include a
   description of how the Linking Food and the Environment (LiFE)
   curriculum can provide a framework to teach science using students'

ID GENERATED ANALOGIES; STUDENTS USE; HANDS-ON; REPRESENTATIONS
AB This study investigated the impact of haptic augmentation of a science
   inquiry program on students' learning about viruses and nanoscale
   science. The study assessed how the addition of different types of
   haptic feedback (active touch and kinesthetic feedback) combined with
   computer visualizations influenced middle and high school students'
   experiences. The influences of a PHANToM (a sophisticated haptic
   desktop device), a Sidewinder (a haptic gaming joystick), and a mouse
   (no haptic feedback) interface were compared. The levels of engagement
   in the instruction and students' attitudes about the instructional
   program were assessed using a combination of constructed response and
   Likert scale items. Potential cognitive differences were examined
   through an analysis of spontaneously generated analogies that appeared
   during student discourse. Results showed that the addition of haptic
   feedback from the haptic-gaming joystick and the PHANToM provided a
   more immersive learning environment that not only made the instruction
   more engaging but may also influence the way in which the students
   construct their understandings about abstract science concepts. (c)

ID VIEWS; WORK
AB The practical epistemology used by students and the epistemological
   moves delivered by teachers in conversations with students are analyzed
   in order to understand how teaching activities interplay with the "how"
   and the "what" of students' learning. The purpose is to develop an
   approach for analyzing the process of privileging in students' meaning
   making and how individual and situational aspects of classroom
   discourse interact in this process. Here we especially focus on the
   experiences of students and the encounter with the teacher. The
   analyses also demonstrate that a study of teaching and learning
   activities can shed light on which role epistemology has for students'
   meaning making, for teaching and for the interplay between these
   activities. The methodological approach used is an elaboration a
   sociocultural perspective on learning, pragmatism, and the work of
   Wittgenstein. The empirical material consists of recordings made in
   science classes in two Swedish compulsory schools. (c) 2005 Wiley

DE higher education; large classes; teaching and learning; technology
AB Often with large classes of students it is difficult to cater for
   individual needs. Large classes hold many students, some of whom may be
   under-prepared for the course they are taking and some who will already
   have a high degree of familiarity with much of the planned content and
   learning outcomes. In catering for the diversity of students, teachers
   often teach to the lowest common denominator, catering for the former,
   but failing to provide a challenging and fulfilling learning programme
   for the latter. This paper describes a project undertaken in an
   Australian university where students enrolled in a large class were
   provided with the opportunity and incentive to undertake a
   technology-facilitated individual authentic learning project in place
   of the more structured coursework pathway. The purpose of the activity
   was to enable advanced students to extend their learning through an
   independent project. An inquiry was undertaken to explore the
   effectiveness of such an approach as a means to cater for diversity in
   the cohort and to investigate the factors influencing the learning
   outcomes that were achieved.

AB It is argued elsewhere that online learning environments constitute new
   conditions for carrying out collaborative learning activities. This
   article explores the roles of a series of online meetings in such an
   environment. The online meetings are arranged as part of a net-based
   course on object-oriented programming, and constitute a recurring
   shared experience for the participants throughout the semester. Through
   an activity theoretical analysis, we find that the meetings mediate the
   learners' actions towards the construction and maintenance of a
   community of practice. Our finding has implications for the
   standardization of digital learning resources. This is an issue that
   will challenge designers of research-oriented learning environments,
   should they attempt to move their systems into wider adoption. We
   suggest that an awareness of the internal systemic connections among
   the components of the course design we studied is of importance when
   considering redesign, with respect to the reuse and standardization of
   learning resources.

   without explicit support of self-regulation (EL). The effects were
   compared between mathematical problem-solving and self-regulated

   EL+IMP students significantly outperformed the EL students in
   problem-solving procedural and transfer tasks regarding mathematical

TI GESTALT: a framework for redesign of educational software
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE boundary objects; educational multimedia; educational redesign; expert
   evaluation; simulation; qualitative evaluation
ID DESIGN
AB Design of educational multimedia rarely starts from scratch, but rather
   by attempting to reuse existing software. Although redesign has been an
   issue in research on evaluation and on learning objects, how it should
   be carried out in a principled way has remained relatively unexplored.
   Furthermore, understanding how empirical research on information and
   communication technologies (ICT) should feed back into redesign remains
   difficult. The present paper addresses these problems from the
   viewpoint of carrying out pedagogical expert evaluations, in the
   absence of empirical studies of target learners, in order to generate
   recommendations for redesign. Firstly, redesign proposals should be
   based on a coherent reconstruction of pedagogical foundations of
   educational ICT (software, documentation). Secondly, redesign proposals
   should result from dialogue between stakeholders, such as future users,
   pedagogical experts, software designers, and deciders. To these ends,
   we propose a framework, called GESTALT (Goals, (E) SiTuations, Actions,
   Learners, Tools), as a 'boundary object' for dialogical redesign.
   Within an activity theory approach, GESTALT is based on analysis of
   available tools, the actions they support, the characteristics of
   learners who perform actions, and pedagogical goals that could be
   achieved in specific situations. An illustrative GESTALT analysis of
   educational software is provided, principally from the viewpoint of
   pedagogical experts. Finally, the strengths and limits of GESTALT are
   discussed.

AB Sixty-five teams of basic and secondary school students solved
   problem-solving tasks during a virtual hike in a Web-based
   inquiry-learning simulation 'Hiking Across Estonia'. This environment
   provided learners with all necessary background information for
   problem-solving and tools for carrying out experiments. There were 25
   tasks in certain order about ecological and environmental issues. The
   teams were clustered according to the data about participants, the
   results of the pre- and post-test, and their achievement in
   problem-solving tasks of the virtual hike. Only two out of five
   clusters were regarded as effective in solving problems and analysing
   tables, graphs, figures, and photos. The others had difficulties in
   forming contextual or task and process awareness. A support system for
   increasing the effectiveness of inquiry learning and enhancing their
   development of analytical skills was developed on the basis of the
   strategies that the members of five clusters had used in solving the
   problems, their achievement in solving the tasks during the virtual
   hike and in the pre- and post-test, and the personal data about the
   teams. The support system contained different notes before solving the
   problems and changed sequence of the tasks on the virtual hike for some
   clusters. The usage of this system was evaluated in a second study with
   60 teams. The comparison of two studies demonstrated significant
   effectiveness of the support system to both general problem-solving
   ability and analytical skills. The characteristics of each cluster and
   the influence of the support system are discussed in this paper.

AB This study examined the effect of scaffolding students who learned by
   designing assignments for a computer simulation on the physics topic of
   alternating circuits. We compared the students' assignments and the
   knowledge acquired in a scaffolded group (N=23) and a non-scaffolded
   group (N=19). The scaffold consisted of a Design Sheet that guided
   students through the different steps in the design of assignments
   (generate an idea, transform the idea into an assignment, and evaluate
   the assignment) and provided them with specific directions on how to
   perform these steps. On average, students in the non-scaffolded group
   designed more assignments than students in the scaffolded group, but
   the scaffolded students designed relative by more assignments about the
   relations in the domain, more often gave exact descriptions of the
   relations in the domain, and more often referred back to the computer
   simulation to explain their findings. No differences on knowledge
   tests, however, were found between the two groups of students. In the
   discussion, we give suggestions on how to adapt the scaffolding to
   improve not only the learning process but also knowledge acquisition.

ID NOTE-TAKING; SYSTEMS
AB As the quantity and the quality of electronic publishing grow and
   students become more computer literate, electronic verbatim note-taking
   acquires a more determinative role in the process of composing reports
   using multiple sources. Many prior applications that supported note
   taking failed to satisfy the students' study models. We developed
   eVerNotes, an application that facilitates verbatim note-taking and
   enables the creation of multiple notes' associations through an
   intermediate hierarchical structure. We conducted three qualitative
   studies, two long-term with realistic time constraints and objectives
   and one in a laboratory, in order to identify obstacles for eVerNotes'
   acceptance, and to analyse synergies that develop through extended
   usage of the application. Although the overwhelming majority of
   students provided positive evaluations of the tool's utility, the
   results underscored that eVerNotes was not used by several participants
   because of their incompatible preconceived expectations and earlier
   experiences, the extra effort imposed on their study model by the
   application and students' loose commitment with the products of the
   study process. On the other hand, students who were willing to
   negotiate their study model exploited eVerNotes' functions and praised
   its contribution to improving their comprehension and the studying
   process. Our results constitute a positive indication for the viability
   of applications that support electronic verbatim note-taking.

ID SELF-EXPLANATIONS
AB This study developed a web-based multimedia whiteboard system to help
   students learning with mathematical problem solving. The purpose is to
   promote a new online mathematical learning model that students not only
   use electronic whiteboard to write down their mathematical problem
   solving solutions but also use voice recording tool to give oral
   explanations about their thinking behind the solutions. To cultivate
   students' critical thinking capability and encourage collaborative peer
   learning, the new learning model also requests students to criticize
   others' solutions and reply to others' arguments. With the multimedia
   supporting tools, students can communicate easily with each other about
   what they think and how they solve mathematical problems. We have
   conducted an experiment with sixth grade primary school students for
   evaluation. After the experiment, a questionnaire about students'
   attitude toward the multimedia whiteboard system for math learning was
   then held. The results show that students were satisfied with the use
   of the multimedia whiteboard system for helping them with learning
   fractional division. Most students were interested in studying
   mathematics with the multimedia whiteboard system and thought this tool
   is particularly useful for doing collaborative learning. After
   analyzing the recorded solving processes and discussions content of
   students, we found that the performance of female students was superior
   to male students in communications and mathematical problem solving.
   Additionally, students with higher final exam grades had better
   mathematical abilities for doing critiques, arguments and
   communications. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A well-constructed test sheet not only helps the instructor evaluate
   the learning status of the students, but also facilitates the diagnosis
   of the problems embedded in the students' learning process. This paper
   addresses the problem of selecting proper test items to compose a test
   sheet that conforms to such assessment requirements as average
   difficulty degree, average discrimination degree, length of test time,
   number of test items, and specified distribution of concept weights. A
   mixed integer programming model is proposed to formulate the problem of
   selecting a set of test items that best fit the multiple assessment
   requirements. As the problem is a generalization of the knapsack
   problem, which is known to be Xg-hard in the literature, computational
   challenge hinders the development of efficient solution methods.
   Seeking approximate solutions in an acceptable time is a viable
   alternative. In this paper, we propose two heuristic algorithms, based
   upon iterative adjustment, for finding quality approximate solutions.
   Extensive experiments are also conducted to assess the performances of
   different solution methods. Statistics from a series of computational
   experiments indicate that our proposed algorithms can produce
   near-optimum combinations of the test items subject to the specified
   requirements in a reasonable time. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Previous computer-assisted problem-solving systems have incorporated
   all the problem-solving steps within a single stage, making it
   difficult to diagnose stages at which errors occurred when a student
   encounters difficulties, and imposing a too-high cognitive load on
   students in their problem solving. This study proposes a
   computer-assisted system named MathCAL, whose design is based on four
   problem-solving stages: (1) understanding the problem, (2) making a
   plan, (3) executing the plan and (4) reviewing the solution. A sample
   of one hundred and thirty fifth-grade students (aged I I years old)
   completed a range of elementary school mathematical problems and
   empirically demonstrated. The results showed MathCAL to be effective in
   improving the performance of students with lower problem solving
   ability. This evaluation allowed us to address the problem of whether
   the assistances in various stages help students with their problem
   solving. These assistances improve students' problem-solving skills in
   each stage. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE cooperative/collaborative learning; distance education and
   tele-learning; interactive learning environments; simulations
AB Design plays a central role in a range of subjects at different
   educational levels. Students have to acquire the knowledge necessary
   for the execution of tasks that enable them to construct an artefact or
   model that can be tested by simulation and that satisfies some
   requirements and verifies some constraints. They achieve this by means
   of a design process. In some design domains there is a lack of teaching
   tools from a learner-centred perspective. Moreover, when these domains
   are complex, the design problems that the students have to solve during
   their learning process require the design activity to be carried out in
   group. In response to this situation, we have developed a design model
   and a collaborative learning method. Using this conceptual framework,
   we have built a collaborative environment for the learning of domotical
   (1) design by means of complex problem solving, with an emphasis on
   synchronous collaboration for work distribution, discussion, design in
   shared surfaces and simulation. This environment has already been
   evaluated and used in real teaching experiences. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Many school systems, in both the developed and developing world, are
   implementing educational technology to assist in student learning.
   However, there is no clear consensus on how to evaluate these new
   technologies. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for
   estimating the value of a new educational technology in three steps:
   benefit analysis, through the administration of a well-designed
   experiment; cost analysis, which incorporates costs to weigh against
   the benefits; and feasibility analysis, which introduces real-world
   concerns that may affect the ability to actually implement the
   technology. To illustrate the methodology, a case study from Chile is
   used where portable educational video games were introduced into first
   and second grade classrooms with the aim of improving learning in
   mathematics and language. This paper demonstrates the importance of all
   three steps in the evaluation process and provides a framework for
   future analyses. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a
   Computer-assisted Instruction Material (CAIM) related to
   "photosynthesis" topic on student cognitive development, misconceptions
   and attitudes. The study conducted in 2002-2003 academic year and was
   carried out in two different classes taught by the same teacher, in
   which there were fifty two 11th grade high school students, in central
   city of Trabzon in Turkey. An experimental research design including
   the photosynthesis achievement test (PAT), the photosynthesis concept
   test (PCT) and science attitude scale (SAS) was applied at the
   beginning and at the end of the research as pre-test and post-test.
   After the treatment, general achievement in PAT increased by 10% in
   favour of experiment group (EG) at (p < 0.05) significant level.
   Although the increase in cognitive development at knowledge level was
   14.8% in the EG and 18.2% in the control group (CG), the development at
   comprehension and application levels were 19.8-18.5 in the EG and
   1.75-0.86 in the CG, respectively. This result showed that using CAIM
   in teaching photosynthesis topic was very effective for students to
   reach comprehension and application levels of cognitive domain.
   However, CAIM did not change major misconceptions related to
   photosynthesis topic in EG as expected. Meanwhile, same misconceptions
   in EG about source of energy for plants and their nutrition were
   decreased more than CG. It was also found out that there was little
   change about students' attitudes towards science education in both
   groups. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
AB This study engages the question of where successful emerging
   (pretenure) scholars are most likely to publish their research. Spurred
   on by findings of a survey of leaders in the field of educational
   technology/instructional design and technology (ET/IDT) to determine
   the advisability of a rank-ordered list of journals for the purposes of
   decision making about tenure and promotion, this document analysis
   presents the results of measuring the conventional wisdom against the
   actual practices of emerging scholars. Findings suggest that pretenure
   scholars publish in a wide variety of outlets including some, but not
   all of those identified in earlier surveys. While it is understood that
   the tenure decision is a complicated one-based on many criteria (eg,
   teaching, service, grantsmanship, etc), research and scholarship remain
   primary determinants. Therefore, these findings will be useful to
   emerging scholars and to those decision makers seeking direction
   regarding research outlets. The study is limited by a focus from an
   original survey conducted in 2003 to primarily North American scholars
   as participants, however, international considerations are included.
   The findings indicate that a list of journals for tenure decision
   making may not be advisable at this point in the development of the
   field of ET/IDT.

TI 'Blended' education and the transformation of teachers: a long-term
   case study in postgraduate UK Higher Education
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper discusses the role of blended learning in teacher education
   on a Master's programme at Manchester University. Blended learning is
   the bringing together of traditional physical classes with elements of
   virtual education. The paper focuses on one particular module of the
   degree and attempts to capture students' experiences of using a number
   of online tools. As our students are primarily in-service teachers,
   this experience is particularly relevant and equips them to make use of
   educational technology in the language classroom. Some comparisons are
   also made with a cohort of teachers studying the programme at a
   distance. The paper explores a range of issues that currently feature
   in the adult education literature, namely, deep and surface learning,
   communities of practice, and the importance of educational dialogue.
   The paper illustrates how important the blended nature of this module
   is for the teachers to get a balanced programme that upgrades skills
   and knowledge, but which also enables them to reflect on past and
   future practice. A transformative education scale is used to show that
   teachers can be transformed. The paper is a case study that makes use
   of data that explore the student perspective on a series of research
   questions.

ID PEOPLE; INFORMATION; TECHNOLOGY; ISSUES
AB The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) by adults
   with learning disabilities has been positively promoted over the past
   decade. More recently, policy statements and guidance from the UK
   government have underlined the importance of ICT for adults with
   learning disabilities specifically, as well as for the population in
   general, through the potential it offers for social inclusion. The aim
   of the present study was to provide a picture of how ICT is currently
   being used within one organisation providing specialist services for
   adults with learning disabilities and more specifically to provide a
   picture of its use in promoting community participation. Nine day and
   14 residential services were visited as part of a qualitative study to
   answer three main questions: What kinds of computer programs are being
   used? What are they being used for? Does this differ between day and
   residential services? Computers and digital cameras were used for a
   wide range of activities and 'mainstream' programs were used more
   widely than those developed for specific user groups. In day services,
   ICT was often embedded in wider projects and activities, whilst use in
   houses was based around leisure interests. In both contexts, ICT was
   being used to facilitate communication, although this was more linked
   to within-service activities, rather than those external to service
   provision.

TI Reflecting on the think-aloud method for evaluating e-learning
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB E-learning is increasingly being used in higher education settings, yet
   research examining how students use e-resources is frequently limited.
   Some previous studies have used the think-aloud method (an approach
   with origins in cognitive psychology) as an alternative to the more
   usual questionnaire or focus groups, but there is little discussion in
   the educational literature about the advantages and disadvantages of
   this approach. In this paper, we discuss our experience of using the
   think-aloud method in a recent study, and we reflect on its potential
   contribution as a research method. A number of concerns about the
   method arose during our study, including the level of guidance given to
   participants, observer influence, and the complexity of data analysis.
   We conclude, however, that the richness of the data collected outweighs
   these constraints, and that the think-aloud method has the potential to
   enhance research in this field.

ID QUALITATIVE DIFFERENCES; TASK
AB This article reports on research into the student experience of
   learning through discussions in a third-year undergraduate engineering
   subject. Information engineering students studying e-commerce were
   required to engage in face-to-face and online discussions as a key
   aspect of their learning experience. This study investigates the
   quality of the experience of learning through those discussions using
   quantitative methodologies from Student Learning Research. Analyses of
   student ratings on the closed-ended questionnaires identify
   qualitatively different approaches to learning through discussions,
   both in face-to-face contexts and online. Relationships are found among
   the variation in the quality of these approaches and how students
   perceive issues such as workload, what they thought they were learning
   through discussions and performance. Implications arising from these
   results identify different suggestions for teaching students to discuss
   successfully in different contexts.

TI Correlation between academic and skills-based tests in computer networks
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Computing-related programmes and modules have many problems, especially
   related to large class sizes, large-scale plagiarism, module
   franchising, and an increased requirement from students for increased
   amounts of hands-on, practical work. This paper presents a practical
   computer networks module which uses a mixture of online examinations
   and a practical skills-based test to assess student performance. For
   widespread adoption of practical assessments, there must be a level of
   checking that the practical assessments are set at a level that
   examinations are set at. This paper shows that it is possible to set
   practical tests so that there can be a strong correlation between
   practical skills-based tests and examination-type assessments, but only
   if the practical assessment are set at a challenging level. This tends
   to go against the proposition that students who are good academically
   are not so good in a practice test, and vice versa. The paper shows
   results which bands students in A, B, C, and FAIL groups based on two
   online, multiple-choice tests, and then analyses the average time these
   students took to complete a practical online test. It shows that there
   is an increasing average time to complete the test for weaker students.
   Along with this, the paper shows that female students in the practical
   test outperform male students by a factor of 25%.

AB A trial of pen-and-paper and online modes of a computing skills test
   was conducted for volunteer students of ages 15-16 in New South Wales,
   Australia. The tests comprised Matching, True/False and 4-option
   Multiple-Choice items. The aims were to determine whether gender,
   socioeconomic status (SES), or the type of item interacted with testing
   mode. No interactions were found for gender and item type, but the SES
   interaction was statistically significant. For low SES students, the
   online mode mean was 1 percent lower than the pen-and-paper mean,
   whereas high SES students had near equivalent means. These findings
   should be treated with caution as the groups in the study were
   self-selected, rather than random samples from the student population.

TI Incorporating partial credit in computer-aided assessment of
   Mathematics in secondary education
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In a mathematical examination on paper, partial credit is normally
   awarded for an answer that is not correct, but, nevertheless, contains
   some of the correct working. Assessment on computer normally marks an
   incorrect answer wrong and awards no marks. This can lead to
   discrepancies between marks awarded for the same examination given in
   the two different media. The current paper presents possible solutions
   to this problem and the results of experiments designed to test how
   successful these solutions are in practice. In light of the findings,
   developments to the assessment engine have been made and some questions
   redesigned for use in real automated examinations. The results were
   obtained as part of the Project for Assessments in Scotland using
   Information Technology (PASS-IT): a major collaborative programme
   involving the leading educational agencies in Scotland (see
   http://www.pass-it.org.uk for more details).
   PASS-IT has demonstrated that the computer can help measure lower order
   student skill profiles provided the computer assessment package is
   sophisticated enough. Optional steps are required to mimic partial
   credit; randomisation of parameters is needed for practice and the
   avoidance of copying; the ability to capture and mark automatically
   mathematical expressions and short free text responses; and the
   delivery in a number of feedback modes are all vital ingredients of an
   automatic assessment system. PASS-IT has shown how to ensure that
   education drives technology and not vice versa. Finally, collaboration
   has been paramount within PASS-IT and should continue. No single group
   has all the keys to unlock the future of computer-aided assessment.
   Scotland is well placed to move forward and e-assess where its students
   e-learn in a large range of subjects such as those delivered via the
   SCHOLAR Programme (see http://scholar.hw.ac.uk). It should be done too
   by ensuring that teachers remain central to the learning cycle by
   supporting the demanding work they do through the supply of suitably
   filtered data on student performance. Special educational needs can
   also be addressed more effectively by the use of technology.

AB An in-depth investigation of the relationship between media
   effectiveness, essentiality, and amount of study was presented.
   Overall, effectiveness explains 48% of the variation in the amount of
   study. Students who found the media more effective studied the media
   more. Those media that were more effective were studied more. The
   relationship between effectiveness and amount of study is different for
   each medium. This is because media differ in their degree of
   'essentiality-versus-optionality'. Thus, the amount of study depends on
   a combination of effectiveness and essentiality. The relationship
   between effectiveness, essentiality, and amount of study is different
   for each student. This is because students differ in their
   'sensitivities'-their sensitivity to effectiveness and to essentiality.
   The final equation used effectiveness, essentiality, and sensitivity to
   explain 74% of the variation in the amount of study. The analysis was
   informed by a mathematical model.

AB The evolution of the World Wide Web has encouraged a huge surfacing of
   e-learning technologies over recent years. Often, such technology is
   rolled out devoid of consideration towards the way in which students
   process and assimilate information. To date, there exists inconclusive
   and contradictory evidence concerning learnability effects of single-
   and dual-model systems in education. To overcome this, we advocate that
   the design of e-learning systems requires a managed mix of elements
   grounded in cognitive psychology. In this paper, we report the results
   of a study concerned with determining an effective mix of multimedia
   elements. This is with regard to the situated learnability effects of
   single- and dual-modal systems tested via 'text only' and 'text and
   auditory-verbal' conditions. We report on these experiments using
   science computer-assisted teaching and music-oriented learning
   environment, e-learning environments developed to act as test platforms
   for this research. The results indicated that simultaneous presentation
   of identical information via text and narration was associated with
   enhanced learnability.

ID STUDENTS; CONSEQUENCES; SCHOOL; WORLD
AB As part of a large-scale instructional intervention research, this
   study examined elementary students' science knowledge and awareness of
   social activism with regard to an increased greenhouse effect and
   global warming. The study involved fifth-grade students from five
   elementary schools of varying demographic makeup in a large urban
   school district in the United States. The study was based on the
   analysis of students' responses to a writing prompt addressing an
   increased greenhouse effect and global warming at the beginning of and
   at the completion of instruction over the school year. The results
   indicate that students with adequate science knowledge tended to
   express activism more frequently, and that their expression of activism
   increased as they gained better science knowledge after the
   instruction. The results highlight the importance of effective
   instruction of this contemporary and controversial issue with K-12
   students, so that they come to be aware of this societal problem, take
   action in solving the problem, and become socially responsible youth

AB This article describes a study into the role of heuristic support in
   facilitating discovery learning through simulation-based learning. The
   study compares the use of two such learning environments in the physics
   domain of collisions. In one learning environment (implicit heuristics)
   heuristics are only used to provide the learner with guidance derived
   from heuristics, without presenting the heuristics themselves; in the
   other (explicit heuristics) the heuristics themselves are also made
   explicit to the learner. The two learning environments are tested with
   46 students from two schools. The results show that learners in both
   conditions gain domain knowledge from pre-test to post-test. Regression
   analyses show that pre-test results can predict post-test results in
   the implicit heuristics condition but not in the explicit heuristic
   condition. Process analyses suggest that presenting the heuristics
   explicitly facilitate more self-regulation in students.

AB This study examined gender differences in 79 high-school students'
   attitudes towards their science classes, their perceptions of science
   and scientists, and their views about majoring in science. The study
   identified some of the subtleties underlying females' low participation
   in, and interest in, science documented in previous research. Four
   themes emerged from responses on the rating scales and questionnaire.
   First, even when females planned to major in science, they were more
   interested than males in the people-oriented aspects of their planned
   majors. Second, biology was the one exception to females' low interest
   in science. Third, females often planned a science major mainly because
   they needed a science background in order to enter a health profession
   such as medicine or physical therapy. Fourth, females generally found
   science uninteresting and the scientific lifestyle (as perceived by
   them) unattractive. Implications for teaching science were discussed.

   BIOLOGY; CONCEPTIONS; INSTRUMENT; PLANTS
AB In this study, a close-ended questionnaire examining all aspects of
   photosynthesis simultaneously has been developed and administered to
   290 Greek pupils aged 13. It contains complementary or logically
   related items that permitted us to assess the understanding of each
   aspect by carrying out cross-analysis. The main findings are: that
   pupils are not able to conceive photosynthesis as a chemical reaction
   and they do not appreciate the role of chlorophyll, that pupils'
   misunderstanding of the energy concept concerns the form of energy
   required as well as the notion of harnessing the sun's energy, that
   some pupils hold the misconception that plants receive all their
   nutrients from the environment, and that pupils confuse photosynthesis
   with respiration and also believe that respiration occurs when there is
   no photosynthesis. This questionnaire could be used by teachers for the
   assessment of their pupils' understanding of each individual aspect of
   photosynthesis and of the simultaneous understanding of more than one
   aspect.

AB This study compares the attitudes of primary children to school science
   between children from the Northern Ireland (UK) and Oman. Previous
   research has indicated that pupils in the more senior primary classes
   showed a marked decline in their enjoyment of school science, although
   most of this research was carried out in Europe, North America, and
   Australia. In this study, an instrument that had been used to measure
   attitudes of pupils in UK schools was adapted for use in Oman. Results
   reveal some striking similarities and interesting differences between
   attitudes of children towards school science. These findings are
   discussed in relation to the respective challenges facing primary
   teachers in regard to teaching science in the two regions.

TI Confidence and loose opportunism in the science classroom: Towards a
   pedagogy of investigative science for beginning teachers
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID STUDENT TEACHER; VIEWS; WORK
AB This paper attempts to establish a conceptual basis on which beginning
   teachers may be introduced to investigative science teaching in a way
   that accommodates the teacher voice. It draws mainly on preliminary
   theory from the shared reflections of 20 science teachers, augmented by
   a more general interview-based study of the experience of early
   professional learning of 18 new teachers. Internationally, it is
   situated in the wider concern in the literature with the nature of
   science, mainly in initial teacher education. Empirically located
   within the Scottish context, a grounded epistemological base of teacher
   knowledge is illustrated and presented as components of confidence in a
   cycle of professional learning that needs to be set in motion during
   initial teacher education. It is proposed that, given protected
   experience in their early attempts to teach investigatively, new
   teachers can begin to develop a confident pedagogy of loose opportunism
   that comes close to authentic science for the children they teach.

DT Article
AB In this article we suggest a method of evaluating learner expertise
   based on assessment of the content of working memory and the extent to
   which cognitive load has been reduced by knowledge retrieved from
   long-term memory. The method was tested in an experiment with an
   elementary algebra tutor using a yoked control design. In the
   learner-adapted experimental group, instruction was dynamically
   tailored to changing levels of expertise using rapid tests of knowledge
   combined with measures of cognitive load. In the nonadapted control
   group, each learner was exposed to exactly the same instructional
   procedures as those experienced by the learner's yoked participant. The
   experimental group demonstrated higher knowledge and cognitive
   efficiency gains than the control group.

TI The impact of sequencing and prior knowledge on learning mathematics
   through spreadsheet applications
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB According to cognitive load theory, instruction needs to be designed in
   a manner that facilitates the acquisition of knowledge in long-term
   memory while reducing unnecessary demands on working memory. When
   technology is used to deliver instruction, the sequence in which
   students learn to use the technology and learn the relevant subject
   matter may have cognitive load implications, and should interact with
   their prior knowledge levels. An experiment, using spreadsheets to
   assist student learning of mathematics, indicated that for students
   with little knowledge of spreadsheets, sequential instruction on
   spreadsheets followed by mathematics instruction was superior to a
   concurrent presentation. The reverse was found for students with more
   knowledge of spreadsheets. These results are explained in terms of
   cognitive load theory.

DT Article
AB This introduction to the special issue provides a context for the
   contributing articles. for readers who are not familiar with cognitive
   load theory (CLT), it provides a very brief description of assumptions
   regarding memory systems and learning processes, different types of
   cognitive load (intrinsic, extraneous, and germane), and design
   implications. Whereas traditional CLT research focused on instructional
   methods to decrease extraneous cognitive load that is not directly
   relevant for learning, contributions to this special issue represent
   wider perspectives that reflect new developments in CLT. These articles
   have been organized into three categories: (a) methods to decrease
   intrinsic cognitive load, and deal with high-element interactivity
   materials, (b) methods to increase germane cognitive load that is
   directly relevant for learning, and (c) methods to deal with
   differences in learner's individual levels of expertise and expertise
   development. To conclude, design implications for (adaptive) e-learning
   are discussed.

TI Cognitive load and learning effects of having students organize
   pictures and words in multimedia environments: The role of student
   interactivity and feedback
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The cognitive load and learning effects of dual-code and interactivity
   - two multimedia methods intended to promote meaningful learning-were
   examined. In Experiment 1, college students learned about the causal
   chain of events leading to the process of lightning formation with a
   set Of words and corresponding pictures (Group WP), pictures (Group P),
   or words (Group W). Some students were presented with the organized
   causal chain of events to study, whereas others were given a
   self-organization task. Consistent with a cognitive theory of
   multimedia learning, Condition WP was the highest in instructional
   efficiency for retention and transfer. However, contrary to our
   predictions, having students organize the multimedia materials was
   detrimental to transfer. Two follow-up experiments tested the
   hypotheses that the negative effects of interactivity were due to
   students' lack of time control (Experiment 2) and the form of feedback
   (Experiment 3). The findings showed that interactivity was effective
   when students were asked to evaluate their answers before receiving
   corrective feedback from the system.

TI Instructional design for advanced learners: Establishing connections
   between the theoretical frameworks of cognitive load and deliberate
   practice
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Cognitive load theory (CLT) has been successful in identifying
   instructional formats that are more effective and efficient than
   conventional problem solving in the initial, novice phase of skill
   acquisition. However, recent findings regarding the "expertise reversal
   effect" have begun to stimulate cognitive load theorists to broaden
   their horizon to the question of how instructional design should be
   altered as a learner's knowledge increases. To answer this question, it
   is important to understand how expertise is acquired and what fosters
   its development. Expert performance research, and, in particular, the
   theoretical framework of deliberate practice have given us a better
   understanding of the principles and activities that are essential in
   order to excel in a domain. This article explores how these activities
   and principles can be used to design instructional formats based on CLT
   for higher levels of skills mastery. The value of these formats for
   e-learning environments in which learning tasks can be adaptively
   selected on the basis of online assessments of the learner's level of
   expertise is discussed.

TI A motivational perspective on the relation between mental effort and
   performance: Optimizing learner involvement in instruction
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Motivation can be identified as a dimension that determines learning
   success and causes the high dropout rate among online learners,
   especially in complex e-learning environments. It is argued that these
   learning environments represent a new challenge to cognitive load
   researchers to investigate the motivational effects of instructional
   conditions and help instructional designers to predict which
   instructional configurations will maximize learning and transfer.
   Consistent with the efficiency perspective introduced by Paas and Van
   Merrienboer (1993), an alternative motivational perspective of the
   relation between mental effort and performance is presented. We propose
   a procedure to compute and visualize the differential effects of
   instructional conditions on learner motivation, and illustrate this
   procedure on the basis of an existing data set. Theoretical and
   practical implications of the motivational perspective are discussed.

TI The function of annotations in the comprehension of scientific texts:
   Cognitive load effects and the impact of verbal ability
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Students participated in a study (n = 98) investigating the
   effectiveness of three types of annotations on three learning outcome
   measures. The annotations were designed to support the cognitive
   processes in the comprehension of scientific texts, with a function to
   aid either the process of selecting relevant information, organizing
   the information in memory, or integrating information with prior
   knowledge. Learning outcomes were measured by assessing student recall
   of facts, comprehension of the text, and mental model construction.
   Results show that different types of annotations facilitate different
   learning outcomes. In addition, we found that, compared to having only
   one type of annotation available, multiple types of annotations
   resulted in a higher cognitive load that resulted in lower performance,
   especially in tests of higher-level processing. This effect was
   stronger for low-verbal-ability learners, who showed lower performance
   in treatments with multiple types of annotations than
   high-verbal-ability learners.

TI Teacher pedagogical beliefs: The final frontier in our quest for
   technology integration?
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Although the conditions for successful technology integration finally
   appear to be in place, including ready access to technology, increased
   training for teachers, and a favorable policy environment, high-level
   technology use is still surprisingly low. This suggests that additional
   barriers, specifically related to teachers' pedagogical beliefs, may be
   at work. Previous researchers have noted the influence of teachers'
   beliefs on classroom instruction specifically in math, reading, and
   science, yet little research has been done to establish a similar link
   to teachers' classroom uses of technology. In this article, I argue for
   the importance of such research and present a conceptual overview of
   teacher pedagogical beliefs as a vital first step. After defining and
   describing the nature of teacher beliefs, including how they are likely
   to impact teachers' classroom practice, I describe important
   implications for teacher professional development and offer suggestions
   for future research.

TI Learning from programmed instruction: Examining implications for modern
   instructional technology
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This article reports a theoretical examination of several parallels
   between contemporary instructional technology (as manifest in one of
   its most current manifestations, online learning) and one of its direct
   predecessors, programmed instruction. We place particular focus on the
   underlying assumptions of the two movements. Our analysis suggests that
   four assumptions that contributed to the historical demise of
   programmed instruction-(a) ontological determinism, (b) materialism, W
   social efficiency, and (d) technological determinism-also underlie
   contemporary instructional technology theory and practice and threaten
   its long-term viability as an educational resource. Based on this
   examination, we offer several recommendations for practicing
   instructional technologists and make a call for innovative assumptions
   and theories not widely visible in the field of instructional
   technology.

TI Computer-based support for curriculum designers: A case of
   developmental research
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In this article, we explore the potential of the computer to support
   curriculum materials development within the context of secondary level
   science and mathematics education in southern Africa. During the
   four-year course of the study, a computer program was developed named
   CASCADE-SEA, which stands for Computer Assisted Curriculum Analysis,
   Design and Evaluation for Science (and mathematics) Education in
   Africa. By carefully documenting the iterative process of analysis,
   prototype design, evaluation, and revision, we sought insight into the
   characteristics of a valid and practical computer-based tool that
   possesses the potential to affect the performance of its users. The
   results of this study include the CASCADE-SEA program itself, which
   assists users in producing better quality materials than they otherwise
   might, while they also learn from the development process. Further,
   this research has contributed to the articulation of design principles
   and related developmental research methods. This article highlights the
   research and development that took place, and only briefly addresses
   the tool itself.

TI Direct instruction revisited: A key model for instructional technology
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Rooted in behavioral theory, particularly the radical or selectivist
   behaviorism of B.F. Skinner (1953, 1954, 1966, 1968, 1974), the direct
   instruction (DI) approach to teaching is now well into its third decade
   of influencing curriculum, instruction, and research. It is also in its
   third decade of controversy. Our purpose is to present the DI model
   with the notion that the designer can and should use the model
   effectively based on appropriate assessment of the learners, content,
   context, and task at hand. To accomplish our goal, we begin with a
   general discussion of the basic DI framework, followed by a summary of
   the major DI models that have been used in live instructional contexts.
   We then shift to a review of how DI has been used in technology-based
   learning environments. Finally, we conclude with a look into the future
   of DI.

TI Promoting technology integration through collaborative apprenticeship
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Teachers often learn technology skills and integration strategies in
   intensive seminars, ineffective means for professional learning because
   experiences are seldom transferred to instructional practices. Thus,
   effective technology integration requires teachers to obtain learning
   experiences within the context of their teaching so they can practice,
   reflect, and modify their practices. Learning in a teaching community
   is a social process that involves ongoing, on-site, and just-in-time
   support. Teachers need avenues to continually interact to provide such
   support across all members of the community. Collaborative
   Apprenticeship, a professional development model featuring reciprocal
   interactions, is one such approach to promoting technology integration.
   Teachers experienced in technology use serve as mentors of
   peer-teachers' technology applications aimed at improving instruction.
   Technology is progressively infused as peer-teachers learn to design
   technology-rich lessons from their technology-savvy peers through
   modeling, collaboration, and coaching.

TI Unique metadata schemas: A model for user-centric design of a
   performance support system
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Learning object technology is viewed as a method for fast retrieval.
   This effort is on developing unique schemas for a targeted group to aid
   efficient retrieval. In this article, I study a user-centric model for
   developing tags for K-12 educators that is based on user needs,
   expectations, and problems. I use a combination of techniques from
   human performance technology and Sensemaking(R) to gather and analyze
   data from potential users. The resultant tag set is simple enough that
   researchers may envision a performance support system where users may
   quickly and easily tag and add objects to the system. This opens the
   door to the creation of systems designed for groups with homogenous
   information needs, with unique metatags, populated largely with objects
   and information brought into the system by the users.

TI Enabling, facilitating, and inhibiting effects of animations in
   multimedia learning: Why reduction of cognitive load can have negative
   results on learning
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB New technologies allow the display of text, static visuals, and
   animations. Although animations are inherently attractive, they are not
   always beneficial for learning. Problems may arise especially when
   animations modify the learner's cognitive load in an unintended way. In
   two learning experiments with 40 and 26 university students, the
   effects of animated pictures on knowledge acquisition were
   investigated. Some pictures displayed visual simulations of changes
   over time, whereas other pictures could be manipulated by learners to
   represent different states in time. Results showed that manipulation
   pictures had an enabling function for individuals with high learning
   prerequisites, whereas simulation pictures had a facilitating function
   for individuals with low learning prerequisites. However, the
   facilitating function was not beneficial for learning, because learners
   were prevented from performing relevant cognitive processes on their
   own. A careful analysis of the interrelation between deferent kinds of
   cognitive load and the process of learning is therefore required.

TI Assessing team-based instructional design problem solutions of

SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB For this study, we examined the cogency, comprehensiveness, and
   viability of team-based problem solutions of a Web-based hypermedia
   case designed to promote student understanding of the practice of
   instructional design. Participants were 14 students enrolled in a
   graduate course on advanced instructional design. The case was
   presented to students using two hypermedia structures, hierarchical
   (tree-like structure) and heterarchical (network-like structure).
   Results from analyses of four data sources revealed that problem
   solutions developed in response to the heterarchical case design were
   more cogent and convincing than problem solutions developed in response
   to the hierarchical case design. Specifically, the heterarchical case
   solutions provided evidence of a heuristic problem-solving process
   facilitating the identification of an expert-like solution to the case
   and the articulation of learners' understanding and application of
   grounded and engaging instructional designs.

TI Instructor influence on reasoned argument in discussion boards
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In this study, we explore the extent to which two instructional
   techniques promote critical discourse in an online class on educational
   standards and curriculum: instructor stance
   (challenging/nonchallenging) and topic level (higher order/lower
   order). Posts from 25 students, across four modules, were analyzed.
   These four modules constituted approximately one third of the course,
   and were selected because the professor was the sole facilitator for
   them. Results indicate that, regardless of topic level, a challenging
   stance by the professor had a positive effect on the percentage of
   student posts that referenced readings and theory. There was an
   interaction between level and stance on student use of reasoned
   argument. Lower order challenging forums were associated with a greater
   percentage of reasoned posts. This may be due to the abstractness of
   the professor's probes in higher order forums. Implications for future
   research include empirical investigations incorporating contextual
   variables and qualitative studies to ascertain how students engage with
   bulletin boards.

TI IDEA: Identifying Design principles in Educational Applets
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The Internet is increasingly being used as a medium for educational
   software in the form of miniature applications (e.g., applets) to
   explore concepts in a domain. One such effort in mathematics education,
   the Educational Software Components of Tomorrow (ESCOT) project,
   created 42 miniature applications each consisting of a context, a set
   of questions, and one or more interactive applets to help students
   explore a mathematical concept. They were designed by experts in
   interface design, educational technology, and classroom teaching.
   However, some applications were more successful for fostering student
   problem-solving than others. This article describes the method used to
   mine a subset (25) of these applets for design principles that describe
   successful learner-centered design by drawing on such data as videos of
   students using the software and summaries of written student work.
   Twenty-one design principles were identified, falling into the
   categories of motivation, presentation, and support for problem
   solving. The main purpose of this article is to operationalize a method
   for post hoc extraction of design principles from an existing library
   of educational software, although readers may also find the design
   principles themselves to be useful.

AB This research focused on the concept of "force" ("CHI-KA-RA" in
   Japanese) in Newtonian mechanics. The primary objective was to develop
   a tool, based on metaphor, to interpret student thinking in learning
   scientific topics. The study provides an example of using the tool to
   trace the process of mutual changes in thinking during a dialog among
   students who have different perspectives on the same topic. "Social
   metaphorical mapping" was used to interpret a dialog between two groups
   of junior high school students with different epistemological paradigms
   with regard to the concept of force (CHI-KA-RA) in the learning
   environment of a computer simulation. Both source domains were
   recontextualized through social metaphorical mapping and the process of
   mutual changes in concepts was traced. Participants noticed that the
   Buridanian(1) concept of "force" differs from the Newtonian concept of
   "force," differentiated between the concepts of "force" that use the
   same Japanese term " CHI-KA-RA," and noticed that the Buridanian(1)
   concept of "force" resembles the Newtonian concept of "momentum."

AB This paper reports on the use of out-of-school everyday contexts in
   Namibian science classrooms. This use is portrayed against the backdrop
   of an explicit educational philosophy of learner-centred teaching. Data
   were collected through audio-taped teacher-learner interactions and
   non-participant field notes in 29 junior and senior science classes
   taught by 12 teachers in six schools. An existing typology was applied
   to classify episodes of use of everyday contexts and identify teachers'
   pedagogic strategies for their use. The results show that more everyday
   contexts are used in junior secondary than in senior secondary classes,
   that only a limited range of types of everyday contexts are used at
   both levels, and that their use often follows theoretical exposition or
   teacher questioning. These findings are related to three
   interpretations of learner-centred teaching. Recommendations for a
   fuller implementation of learner-centred teaching are made.

ID HIGH-SCHOOL SCIENCE; INQUIRY; CURRICULUM; DISCOURSE
AB A Korean science teacher's discursive practises were examined with a
   view to identifying pedagogical roles performed through his talk. Data
   came from the video recordings of classroom sessions where students
   presented their science projects and exchanged questions and answers
   during the presentations. Transcripts were developed and analysed in a
   qualitative way that identified the teacher's pedagogical roles to help
   students in the learning process. Three major discursive roles were
   defined, including making scientific knowledge available to students,
   coaching students to manage and enhance their performance, and
   scaffolding. Nine subordinate roles are also identified. Educational
   meanings of these teacher roles are elaborated upon, and implications
   for better teaching practises in the science classroom are discussed.

AB This paper reports findings about a curriculum innovation conducted at
   The University of Hong Kong. A CD-ROM consisting of videos of two
   lessons by different teachers demonstrating exemplary science teaching
   was used to elicit conceptions of good science teaching of
   student-teachers enrolled for the 1-year Postgraduate Diploma in
   Education at several stages during the programme. It was found that the
   videos elicited student-teachers' conceptions and had impact on those
   conceptions prior to the commencement of formal instruction. It has
   extended student-teachers' awareness of alternative teaching methods
   and approaches not experienced in their own schooling, broadened their
   awareness of different classroom situations, provided proof of
   existence of good practices, and prompted them to reflect on their
   current preconceptions of good science teaching. In several ways, the
   videos acted as a catalyst in socializing the transition of
   student-teachers from the role of student to the role of teacher.

AB This study investigates the psychosocial environments of secondary
   schools from science teachers' perspectives, as well as associated
   variables. Using a sample of 900 secondary science teachers from 52
   schools in Taiwan, the results attest to the validity and reliability
   of the instrument, the Science Teacher School Environment
   Questionnaire, and its ability to differentiate among schools. The
   descriptive results show that a majority of science teachers positively
   perceived their school environments. The teachers reported high
   collegiality, good teacher-student relations, effective principal
   leadership, strong professional interest, and low work pressure-but
   also low staff freedom. Multiple regression results further indicate
   that policy-relevant variables like school level, school location, and
   teachers' intentions to stay in teaching were associated with science
   teachers' perceptions of their school environments. Qualitative data
   analysis based on interviews of 34 science teachers confirmed and
   enriched these findings.

AB This article describes the development and validation of an instrument
   that can be used to assess students' perceptions of their learning
   environment as a means of monitoring and guiding changes towards
   outcomes-based education. In the first phase, data collected from 2638
   Grade 8 science students from 50 classes in 50 schools in the Limpopo
   Province of South Africa were analysed to provide evidence about the
   reliability and validity of the new instrument. In the second phase,
   two case studies were used to investigate whether profiles of class
   mean scores on the new instrument could provide an accurate and
   "trustworthy" description of the learning environment of individual
   science classes. The study makes significant contributions to the field
   of learning environments in that it is one of the first major studies
   of its kind in South Africa and because the instrument developed
   captures important aspects of the learning environment associated with
   outcomes-based education.

TI Sex-related differences in the determinants and process of science and
   mathematics choice in pre-university education
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCHOOL; SECONDARY; TECHNOLOGY; SUBJECT
AB The more science and mathematics subjects that pupils in pre-university
   education include in their final examination package, the more future
   academic routes are available to them. Equality of educational
   opportunity is thus threatened when groups of pupils, distinguished by
   sex and family background but otherwise of equal capacities and
   achievement, are found to differ in their choices. This proposition is
   examined using data from a large Dutch cohort. Multilevel analyses show
   that the choice of science and mathematics subjects by girls is
   influenced by their family background while the choice by boys is not.
   The influence of various pupil and family variables on the subject
   selection process is explored via path analyses. The results confirm
   the importance of viewing subject choice as a chronological process
   that progresses differently for boys and girls.

SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING

ID INQUIRY
AB The interpretation of data and construction and interpretation of
   graphs are central practices in science, which, according to recent
   reform documents, science and mathematics teachers are expected to
   foster in their classrooms. However, are (preservice) science teachers
   prepared to teach inquiry with the purpose of transforming and
   analyzing data, and interpreting graphical representations? That is,
   are preservice science teachers prepared to teach data analysis and
   graph interpretation practices that scientists use by default in their
   everyday work? The present study was designed to answer these and
   related questions. We investigated the responses of preservice
   elementary and secondary science teachers to data and graph
   interpretation tasks. Our investigation shows that, despite
   considerable preparation, and for many, despite bachelor of science
   degrees, preservice teachers do not enact the ("authentic") practices
   that scientists routinely do when asked to interpret data or graphs.
   Detailed analyses are provided of what data and graph interpretation
   practices actually were enacted. We conclude that traditional schooling
   emphasizes particular beliefs in the mathematical nature of the
   universe that make it difficult for many individuals to deal with data
   possessing the random variation found in measurements of natural
   phenomena. The results suggest that preservice teachers need more
   experience in engaging in data and graph interpretation practices
   originating in activities that provide the degree of variation in and
   complexity of data present in realistic investigations. (c) 2005 Wiley

   CONCEPTIONS; SCIENCE INSTRUCTION; 8TH GRADERS; KNOWLEDGE; CLASSROOM
AB This study was based on the framework of the "conflict map" to
   facilitate student conceptual learning about causes of the seasons.
   Instruction guided by the conflict map emphasizes not only the use of
   discrepant events, but also the resolution of conflict between
   students' alternative conceptions and scientific conceptions, using
   critical events or explanations and relevant perceptions and
   conceptions that explicate the scientific conceptions. Two ninth grade
   science classes in Taiwan participated in this quasi-experi mental
   study in which one class was assigned to a traditional teaching group
   and the other class was assigned to a conflict map instruction
   treatment. Students' ideas were gathered through three interviews: the
   first was conducted I week after the instruction; the second 2 months
   afterward; and the third at 8 months after the treatment. Through an
   analysis of students' interview responses, it was revealed that many
   students, even after instruction, had a common alternative conception
   that seasons were determined by the earth's distance to the sun.
   However, the instruction guided by the framework of the conflict map
   was shown to be a potential way of changing the alternative conception
   and acquiring scientific understandings, especially in light of
   long-term observations. A detailed analysis of students' ideas across
   the interviews also strongly suggests that researchers as well as
   practicing teachers need to pay particular attention to those students
   who can simply recall the scientific fact without deep thinking, as
   these students may learn science through rote memorization and soon
   regress to alternative conceptions after science instruction. (c) 2005

AB This study explores general-chemistry instructors' awareness of and
   ability to identify and address common student learning obstacles in
   chemical equilibrium. Reported instructor strategies directed at
   remediating student alternate conceptions were investigated and
   compared with successful, literature-based conceptual change methods.
   Fifty-two volunteer general chemistry instructors from 50 U.S. colleges
   and universities completed an interactive web-based instrument
   consisting of open-ended questions, a rating scale, classroom
   scenarios, and a demographic form. Survey respondents who provided
   responses or described remediation strategies requiring further
   clarification were identified (n = 6); these respondents amplified
   their views in separate, researcher-led semistructured phone
   interviews. All 52 responding chemistry instructors reported and
   identified common student areas of difficulty in chemical equilibrium.
   They reported employing a variety of strategies to address and attempt
   to remediate students' alternate conceptions; however, these
   self-reported strategies rarely included all four necessary conditions
   specified by Posner, Strike, Hewson, and Gertzog (Science Education,
   66, 211-217, 1982) to stimulate conceptual change.
   Instructor-identified student alternate conceptions were congruent with
   literature-reported alternate conceptions of chemical equilibrium, thus
   providing validation support for these compilations. Implications for
   teaching and further research are also highlighted. (c) 2005 Wiley

AB This study describes the multiple analogical models used to introduce
   and teach Grade 12 chemical equilibrium. We examine the teacher's
   reasons for using models, explain each model's development during the
   lessons, and analyze the understandings students derived from the
   models. A case study approach was used and the data were drawn from the
   observation of three consecutive Grade 12 lessons on chemical
   equilibrium, pre- and post-lesson interviews, and delayed student
   interviews. The key analogical models used in teaching were: the
   "school dance"; the "sugar in a teacup"; the "pot of curry"; and the
   "busy highway." The lesson and interview data were subject to multiple,
   independent analyses and yielded the following outcomes: The teacher
   planned to use the students' prior knowledge wherever possible and he
   responded to student questions with stories and extended and enriched
   analogies. He planned to discuss where each analogy broke down but did
   not. The students enjoyed the teaching but built variable mental models
   of equilibrium and some of their analogical mappings were unreliable. A
   female student disliked masculine analogies, other students tended to
   see elements of the multiple models in isolation, and some did not
   recognize all the analogical mappings embedded in the teaching plan.
   Most students learned that equilibrium reactions are dynamic, occur in
   closed systems, and the forward and reverse reactions are balanced. We
   recommend the use of multiple analogies like these and insist that
   teachers always show where the analogy breaks down and carefully
   negotiate the conceptual outcomes. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   Comparing teachers' views
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID CURRICULUM; STUDENTS; COURSES
AB The study explores teachers' experiences of teaching a context-based
   chemistry course, Salters Advanced Chemistry, as compared with teachers
   of a conventional course. Second, main factors that appear to influence
   decisions over whether or not to adopt context-based courses are
   investigated. Two hundred and twenty-two teachers' views of a
   context-based and a conventional school advanced chemistry course were
   obtained from a questionnaire. Responses were analysed in six
   dimensions: motivation, chemical knowledge and development of concepts,
   learning activities, assessment, challenge to teachers and students,
   and teacher support. Both sets of teachers agreed that the
   context-based course is more motivating to study and teach, that
   students would be more interested in chemistry and more likely to go to
   university to study chemistry, that students would be better able to
   study independently but that it is more demanding to teach and study.
   The groups differed principally about concept development and teaching
   strategy. The context-based teachers believed that their course gave as
   good a foundation for further study as a traditional course and that
   the spiral curriculum was advantageous. Conventional course teachers
   disagreed with both statements. One significant implication to emerge
   from the study is the crucial role played by in-service support in
   influencing the impact of a curriculum innovation.

   program with satisfactory scientific literacy and attitudes toward

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID BALANCE
AB Scientific literacy and attitudes toward science play an important role
   in human daily lives. The purpose of this study was to investigate
   whether first-year pre-service teachers in colleges in Taiwan have a
   satisfactory level of scientific literacy. The domains of scientific
   literacy selected in this study include: ( 1) science content; ( 2) the
   interaction between science, technology and society (STS); ( 3) the
   nature of science; and ( 4) attitudes toward science. In this study,
   the instruments used were Chinese translations of the Test of Basic
   Scientific Literacy (TBSL) and the Test of Science-related Attitudes.
   Elementary education majors (n = 141) and science education majors ( n
   = 138) from four teachers' colleges responded to these instruments. The
   statistical results from the tests revealed that, in general, the basic
   scientific literacy of first-year pre-service teachers was at a
   satisfactory level. Of the six scales covered in this study, the
   pre-service teachers displayed the highest literacy in health science,
   STS, and life science. Literacy in the areas of the nature of science
   and earth science was rated lowest. The results also showed that
   science education majors scored significantly higher in physical
   science, life science, nature of science, science content, and the TBSL
   than elementary science majors. Males performed better than females in
   earth science, life science, science content, and the TBSL. Next,
   elementary education majors responded with more "don't know" responses
   than science education majors. In general, the pre-service teachers
   were moderately positive in terms of attitudes toward science while
   science education majors had more positive attitudes toward science.
   There was no significant difference in attitudes between genders.
   Previous experience in science indicated more positive attitudes toward
   science. The results from stepwise regression revealed that STS, the
   nature of science, and attitudes toward science could explain 50.6% and
   60.2% variance in science content in elementary education and science
   education majors, respectively. For science education majors, the first
   three scales - the nature of science, health science and physical
   science - determined basic scientific literacy. However, for elementary
   education majors, the top three factors were physical science, life
   science and the nature of science. Based on these results, several
   strategies for developing the professional abilities of science
   teachers have been recommended for inclusion in pre-service programs.

AB This paper reports a cross-sectional study of Taiwanese physics
   students' understanding of subatomic phenomena that are explained by
   quantum mechanics. The study uses students' explanations of their
   answers to items in a questionnaire as a proxy for students' thinking.
   The variation in students' explanations is discussed as is the
   development in the way in which students link different concepts. A
   discussion of the source of students' ideas turns to the way schema
   contain mental models that derive from sensori-experiences. The
   principal recommendation for teaching is the need to include practical
   activities on a range of precursor phenomena so as to extend the
   students repertoires of mental models. This advice is different from
   that given in previous studies.

AB This article reports the development and application of two instruments
   for assessing science teachers' pedagogical knowledge in the context of
   teaching higher-order thinking: a Likert-type research instrument, and
   an instrument that analyzes classroom observations. The rationale for
   developing these instruments and their main categories is described.
   One hundred and fifty Israeli science teachers replied to the
   Likert-type questionnaire. Results show that biology teachers gained a
   significantly higher score than either physics or chemistry teachers,
   that junior high school teachers scored significantly higher than high
   school teachers, and that a significant negative correlation was found
   between final scores and teaching experience. Participants in the
   classroom observation study were 14 teachers who attended a one-year
   professional development course for teaching higher-order thinking. The
   instrument was sensitive in detecting progress in teachers' pedagogical
   knowledge in several categories, such as: Frequency of tasks that
   required higher-order thinking; The variety of thinking strategies that
   teachers addressed during their lessons; Engagement of students in
   metacognitive thinking; and Using the "language of thinking" in class.
   The implications of the findings for research and practice are
   described.

AB The purpose of this study was to describe the development and
   validation of an instrument to identify various dimensions of
   scientific epistemological views (SEVs) held by high school students.
   The instrument included five SEV dimensions (subscales): the role of
   social negotiation on science, the invented and creative reality of
   science, the theory-laden exploration of science, the cultural impacts
   on science, and the changing features of science. Six hundred and
   thirteen high school students in Taiwan responded to the instrument.
   Data analysis indicated that the instrument developed in this study had
   satisfactory validity and reliability measures. Correlation analysis
   and in-depth interviews supported the legitimacy of using multiple
   dimensions in representing student SEVs. Significant differences were
   found between male and female students, and between students' and their
   teachers' responses on some SEV dimensions. Suggestions were made about
   the use of the instrument to examine complicated interplays between
   SEVs and science learning, to evaluate science instruction, and to
   understand the cultural differences in epistemological views of science.

AB Given the progressive loss of influence for the school relative to
   television in youngsters' everyday lives, this article describes the
   procedure and the results of including cartoons in the physics
   curriculum in secondary education. Work was carried out intensively
   with a small group of pupils and sporadically with a larger group. In
   the first case, cartoons were used for identifying and discussing
   fictitious phenomena, problem-solving, and assessment of the learning.
   In the second case, for identifying and discussing fictitious
   phenomena, a quasi-experimental research design was followed. The
   results back the use of this didactic tool as an element for motivating
   and invigorating the classroom, for identifying the pupils' alternative
   ideas and the assessment of their learning, as well as for a more
   critical way of watching television.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

AB This paper is about a longitudinal study to investigate how
   student-teachers developed understanding of some key ecological
   concepts during a teacher education programme. Another aim was to
   interpret the student-teachers' intentions in respect of the programme
   and to examine how these intentions influenced their learning. A group
   of students were followed through 2.5 years of a teacher education
   programme. The whole student group (n = 47 - 60) answered a
   questionnaire three times. Their understanding of scientific concepts,
   relevant to environmental education, was examined. Fourteen students
   were interviewed three times about a newspaper article discussing the
   use of surplus heat from a crematorium. The students were also asked
   about expectations of the teaching programme and of learning
   experiences from their science courses and from school practice. It is
   concluded that many of the student-teachers did not develop the
   conceptual understanding necessary to be able to engage with the
   socio-scientific issue presented to them. It also concludes that many
   of the student-teachers approach the learning of science content from
   the perspective of their personal notions of the tasks of a primary
   schoolteacher, which is significantly different from the perspectives
   underpinning the curriculum and the intention of teacher educators. The
   connection between these two conclusions is discussed.

   INQUIRY; SYSTEMS; PHYSICS
AB Although computer modelling is widely advocated as a way to offer
   students a deeper understanding of complex phenomena, the process of
   modelling is rather complex itself and needs scaffolding. In order to
   offer adequate support, we need a thorough understanding of the
   reasoning processes students employ and of difficulties they encounter
   during a modelling task. Therefore, in this study 26 students, working
   in dyads, were observed while working on a modelling task in the domain
   of physics. A coding scheme was developed in order to capture the types
   of reasoning processes used by students. Results indicate that most
   students had a strong focus on adjusting model parameters to fit the
   empirical data with little reference to prior knowledge. The successful
   students differed from the less successful students in using more prior
   knowledge and in showing more inductive reasoning. These observations
   lead to suggestions for the design of appropriate scaffolds.

AB A literature-based survey gathered 331 final-year preservice teachers'
   perceptions of their mentoring in primary science education from nine
   Australian universities. Data were analysed within five factors
   proposed for mentoring (i.e., Personal Attributes, System Requirements,
   Pedagogical Knowledge, Modelling, and Feedback). Results indicated that
   the majority of mentors ( primary teachers) did not provide specific
   mentoring in primary science, particularly in the science teaching
   practices associated with the factors System Requirements, Pedagogical
   Knowledge, and Modelling. This study argues that mentors may require
   further education to learn how to mentor specifically in primary
   science, and proposes a specific mentoring intervention as a way
   forward for developing the mentor's mentoring and teaching of primary
   science.

AB This study investigated how individuals' construction of explanations -
   a way of ascertaining how well an individual understands a concept -
   develops from an interactive simulation. Specifically, the purpose was
   to investigate the effect of interactive computer simulations or
   science textbook assignments on the nature and quality of postgraduate
   science teachers' explanations regarding physical phenomena in
   Mechanics, Waves/Optics, and Thermal Physics. The use of simulations or
   science textbook assignments was implemented according to the Predict -
   Observe - Explain model and integrated into a one-semester conceptual
   survey course in physics for practising science teachers who served as
   participants in the study. Data were collected through semi-structured
   interviews and were analysed using a qualitative content analysis
   approach. Results indicate that the use of computer simulations along
   with the application of the Predict - Observe - Explain model had a
   positive impact on the nature and quality of science teachers'
   explanations. They improved science teachers' ability to generate
   scientifically accurate explanations and fostered in-depth advancement
   in teachers' search for explanatory scientific information regarding
   the physical phenomena under investigation. In addition, teachers'
   explanations became more elaborate, reflecting cause-effect reasoning
   and formal reasoning.

AB This study aims at presenting a grid for analysing the way the language
   employed in Greek school science textbooks tends to project pedagogic
   messages. These messages are analysed for the different school science
   subjects ( i. e., Physics, Chemistry, Biology) and educational levels (
   i. e., primary and lower secondary level). The analysis is made using
   the dimensions of content specialisation ( classification) and social-
   pedagogic relationships ( framing) promoted by the language of the
   school science textbooks as well as the elaboration and abstraction of
   the corresponding linguistic code ( formality), thus combining
   pedagogical and socio- linguistic perspectives. Classification and
   formality are used to identify the ways science textbooks tend to
   position students in relation to the interior of the corresponding
   specialised body of knowledge ( i. e., in terms of content and code)
   while framing is used to identify the ways science textbooks tend to
   position students as learning subjects within the school science
   discourse. The results show that the kind of pedagogic messages
   projected by the textbooks depends mainly on the educational level and
   not particularly on the specific discipline. As the educational level
   rises a gradual move towards more specialised forms of scientific
   knowledge ( mainly in terms of code) with a parallel increase in the
   students' autonomy in accessing the textbook material is noticed. The
   implications concern the way both students and teachers approach
   science textbooks as well as the roles they can undertake by
   internalising the textbooks' pedagogic messages and also the way
   science textbooks are authored.

AB In this paper, we present a case study of a beginning chemistry teacher
   who enrolled in a project aimed to contribute to the development of
   teachers' knowledge of models and modelling in science. The project
   consisted of a series of institutional meetings in combination with an
   action research project the teacher conducted in her own classes. By
   explaining how the project was conducted and mainly by focusing on the
   teacher's voice, her dynamic, continuous, and non- linear process of
   knowledge development is discussed in detail. We were able to
   investigate and describe this development in terms of various types of
   knowledge - content knowledge, curricular knowledge and pedagogical
   content knowledge - which were developed simultaneously. Among other
   results, it became clear how certain institutional activities led to
   specific choices in the teacher's action research project. For
   instance, although initially she was reluctant to conduct a modelling
   activity in her class, she decided to experiment with such an activity
   in her action research project. Subsequently, the responses of her
   students during the project convinced her of the value of this
   modelling activity and helped her to become aware of specific views of
   her students. Finally, it became evident that the whole experience made
   her very enthusiastic and stimulated her to formulate specific
   intentions with respect to the future, both in terms of applying
   certain teaching activities and in terms of collaborating with
   colleagues.

AB The purpose of this article is to describe the development, validation
   and use of the Constructivist Multimedia Learning Environment Survey (
   CMLES). This questionnaire assesses teachers' and students' perceptions
   of the learning environment when students use online multimedia
   programs while teachers use constructivism as a referent for their
   teaching. The design of the questionnaire was based on a constructivist
   approach to learning and focused on the process of learning with the
   multimedia program and on the nature of that program. Before the use of
   the CMLES becomes widespread, it was important to determine whether it
   is valid and reliable. Therefore, a study involving 221 students in 12
   high school classrooms into statistical validation and interpretive
   validation of the questionnaire was undertaken. For this sample of
   Grade 10 and 11 students who completed the actual and preferred forms
   of the questionnaire, the CMLES scales demonstrated a high degree of
   internal consistency reliability ( with alpha reliability coefficients
   ranging from.73 to.82), as well as satisfactory factorial validity and
   discriminant validity. Therefore, the study supports the reliability
   and validity of the CMLES for assessing students' and teachers'
   perceptions of one important aspect in evaluating learning environments
   which promote the use of multimedia programs and constructivist
   learning approaches.

AB The purpose of this study was to describe how three primary teachers
   attempted to overcome incomplete content knowledge when teaching an
   astronomy unit. Daily observations of science activities were
   videotaped and transcribed from each classroom to determine the
   influences on the changes in teacher and student ideas of astronomy.
   Teachers' ideas were triggered toward the more scientific by classroom
   interactions. Influences on the experienced teachers' ideas were
   questions raised by the students, or conceptions students held of the
   content. Experienced teachers planned to elicit and address student
   ideas, and so were triggered to improve their understanding of the
   astronomy.

AB The new 1 - 9 curriculum framework in Taiwan provides a remarkable
   change from previous frameworks in terms of the coverage of content and
   the powers of teachers. This study employs a modified repertory grid
   technique to investigate biology teachers' preferences with regard to
   six curriculum components. One hundred and eighty- five in- service and
   pre- service biology teachers were asked to determine which science
   curriculum components they liked and disliked most of all to include in
   their biology classes. The data show that the rank order of these
   science curriculum components, from top to bottom, was as follows:
   application of science, manipulation skills, scientific concepts,
   social/ ethical issues, problem- solving skills, and the history of
   science. They also showed that pre-service biology teachers, as
   compared with in- service biology teachers, favored problem- solving
   skills significantly more than manipulative skills, while in- service
   biology teachers, as compared with pre- service biology teachers,
   favored manipulative skills significantly more than problem- solving
   skills. Some recommendations for ensuring the successful implementation
   of the Taiwanese 1 - 9 curriculum framework are also proposed.

AB This study investigated the chemistry laboratory classroom environment,
   teacher-student interactions and student attitudes towards chemistry
   among 497 gifted and non-gifted secondary-school students in Singapore.
   The data were collected using the 35-item Chemistry Laboratory
   Environment Inventory (CLEI), the 48-item Questionnaire on Teacher
   Interaction (QTI) and the 30-item Questionnaire on Chemistry-Related
   Attitudes (QOCRA). Results supported the validity and reliability of
   the CLEI and QTI for this sample. Stream (gifted versus non-gifted) and
   gender differences were found in actual and preferred chemistry
   laboratory classroom environments and teacher-student interactions.
   Some statistically significant associations of modest magnitude were
   found between students' attitudes towards chemistry and both the
   laboratory classroom environment and the interpersonal behaviour of
   chemistry teachers. Suggestions for improving chemistry laboratory
   classroom environments and the teacher-student interactions for gifted
   students are provided.

AB Practical knowledge and skills are necessary components of expertise.
   Practical training in higher education has been shown to foster
   students' learning and understanding of theoretical backgrounds. The
   attitude and skill of mentors play a central role in enhancing the
   quality of students' practical learning. The aims of this study were to
   explore mentors' experiences of the practice period and mentoring
   process, and to develop practical performances to improve the practice
   period that s included in theoretical pharmaceutical studies in
   Finland. A total of 48 pharmacy mentors were interviewed during the
   practice period of the pharmacy curriculum. The interviews were
   analysed using qualitative content analysis. The results showed that
   the mentors considered the practice period an essential part of
   pharmacy studies, which fostered student learning and benefited the
   community pharmacy. Mentoring activities, mentoring processes and
   assessment of students varied in the pharmacies. The results showed
   that it is necessary to pay more attention to the aims and the content
   of the practice period. More cooperation is needed between the
   University and pharmacies. There is also a clear need to pay attention
   to reflective action in order to foster the quality of practical
   learning.

AB In 1983, the National Commission on Excellence in Education in the
   United States issued a report called A Nation at Risk: The Imperative
   for Educational Reform. This report and other policy initiatives such
   as the No Child Left Behind Legislation recommended that the individual
   states institute assessments to hold schools accountable. This research
   explored the potential impact of impending standardised testing on
   teaching science in elementary schools in one school district in
   Florida. We explored the teachers' concerns about the upcoming
   high-stakes tests in science, possible impact on their curriculum and
   what changes, if any, will be made in the approach to science teaching
   and learning in their classrooms. As the teachers look toward the
   implementation of high-stakes testing in science, they have recognised
   the need to teach science. This recognition is not borne out of the
   importance of science learning for elementary school children, but
   rather out of fear of failure and the effects of tangible rewards or
   punishments that accompany high-stakes testing. In anticipation, the
   teachers are preparing to align their teaching to the science standards
   while aggressively searching for test preparatory materials. Schools
   are also involved in professional development and structural changes to
   facilitate teaching of science.

AB The paper describes characteristics and analyses difficulties of
   environmental sciences teachers in mentoring their students in an
   extended inquiry project, which is a mandatory requirement of the
   environmental sciences matriculation in Israel. The teachers
   participated in a professional development program that provided both
   content knowledge and support for conducting inquiry, and enabled the
   teachers to guide the students in the inquiry project. Teachers who had
   experience in inquiry identified more skills required for mentoring
   students' inquiry, and provided a non-directive guidance pattern,
   whereas inexperienced teachers acknowledged less skills, and tended to
   present a directive-authoritative approach. Insufficient content and
   pedagogical content knowledge affected the teachers who closely
   controlled their students' work.

AB The issue of unfairness arises in high-stakes public examinations when
   students choose questions from alternatives that are offered and marks
   on the alternatives turn out to be discrepant. This paper addresses and
   defines unfairness and discrepancy in the context of alternative
   questions in Physics Tertiary Entrance Examinations (TEE) in Western
   Australia. As well, I present an analysis of question characteristics
   that explain observed marks-differences. The characteristics mainly
   relate to the construction of the text of questions, the detail on
   diagrams, and requirements for calculation. The list of characteristics
   could inform the setting of compulsory as well as alternative
   examination questions. The paper includes a brief exploration of
   results by gender on the alternative Physics TEE questions.

AB During their years of schooling, students develop perceptions about
   learning and teaching, including the ways in which teachers impact on
   their learning experiences. This paper presents student perceptions of
   teacher pedagogy as interpreted from a study focusing on students'
   experience of Year 7 science. A single science class of 11 to 12 year
   old students and their teacher were monitored for the whole school
   year, employing participant observation, and interviews with focus
   groups of students, their teacher and other key members of the school.
   Analysis focused on how students perceived the role of the teacher's
   pedagogy in constructing a learning environment that they considered
   conducive to engagement with science learning. Two areas of the
   teacher's pedagogy are explored from the student perspective of how
   these affect their learning: instructional pedagogy and relational
   pedagogy. Instructional pedagogy captures the way the instructional
   dialogue developed by the teacher drew the students into the learning
   process and enabled them to "understand" science. How the teacher
   developed a relationship with the students is captured as relational
   pedagogy, where students said that they learned better when teachers
   were passionate in their approach to teaching, provided a supportive
   learning environment and made them feel comfortable. The ways in which
   the findings support the direction for the middle years and science
   education are considered.

AB We report on a study of what happened when we recycled a conceptual
   examination question in a first-year university physics course. The
   question, which was used for three consecutive years, asked about an
   astronaut's experience of weighing in an orbiting space-craft. Our
   original intention was to use a phenomenographic approach to look for
   differences in students' descriptive answers. Having done that, we
   decided to add a study of the marks that were awarded to those answers.
   The first time that the question was re-used, the distribution of
   answers amongst our phenomenographic categories showed a decrease in
   the common conception that gravity is zero in the satellite and an
   increase in explanations in terms of free fall. When the question was
   re-used a second time, that difference was maintained but it was not
   significantly increased. The distribution of marks for the question was
   different over the three years in a way that appears to be unrelated to
   differences in students' conceptual understandings. Differences in the
   distribution of marks are more likely to be related to differences in
   marking procedures. We conclude that studies like this one have the
   potential to contribute to improvements in university assessment
   procedures. In particular we propose that phenomenographic analysis
   could be used in the design of marking schemes.

AB The explanations of thirty primary pupils for changes in matter were
   recorded through individual, semi-structured interviews. The analysis
   of data pointed to the construction of a system for classifying pupils'
   explanations of changes in matter. A parallel analysis of data focused
   on the identification and interpretation of associations between the
   explanatory categories resulting from the classification, and certain
   variables of the context, that is (a) category of change to be
   explained, and (b) familiarity with the system about which they were
   being questioned. The results of the two phases of the analysis were
   combined with the findings of a previous study, to produce the
   formation of a limited number of pupils' models concerning matter,
   changes in matter and their explanations. Pupils' models involve a
   variety of conceptions which could be attributed to the presence of a
   conceptual obstacle: that is the "continuous and static conception of
   matter." The definition of teaching objectives in relation to obstacles
   ("obstacles as objectives") can bring together pupils' conceptions with
   concepts to be built and consequently to contribute to the design and
   evaluation of constructivist teaching and appropriate material.

AB The use of computer technology in schools has made slow progress since
   the mid- 1980s even though governments have been generous in funding.
   It is therefore important to understand how and when teachers use
   computer technology in order to devise implementation strategies to
   encourage them. This study investigates student teachers' perceptions
   of computer technology in relation to their intention to use computers.
   The purpose is to shed light on more effective ways to motivate the use
   of computer technology in schools. Based on an expanded variation of
   the Technology Acceptance Model, 84 completed surveys of student
   teachers were collected at a local university in Sweden. Overall, the
   results indicated that ( 1) student teachers' perceived usefulness of
   computer technology had a direct significant effect on their intention
   to use it; ( 2) student teachers' perceived ease of use had only an
   indirect significant effect on intention to use; however, ( 3) student
   teachers' subjective norm, that is the possible influence of external
   expectations, did not have any direct or indirect significant effects
   on their intention to use computer technology. Theoretical and
   practical implications that follow from the results are discussed.

AB Designing and implementing effective e- learning is a complex process,
   which involves many factors. Lecturers need to constantly consider,
   evaluate and adjust these factors to provide effective e- learning
   environments for students. In this paper, we report on the design and
   development of the Online Learning Environment Survey ( OLES), an
   instrument which can be used to gather and represent data on students'
   'actual' (experienced) and 'preferred' ( ideal) learning environments.
   We describe the use of this instrument in blended learning environments
   with university classes, illustrating how OLES can be used by educators
   striving for good practice in the design of effective online learning

DE empirical; individual differences; pedagogical agents; relation

ID AGENTS
AB It is frequently held forth, within the area of virtual pedagogical
   characters, that such characters are beneficial for learning as they
   strengthen the social dimension of electronic learning environments.
   This article presents more details on this proposal together with a
   survey of corresponding empirical evidence. In addition, materials from
   a recently conducted empirical study are presented. Ninety school
   children, 12-15-year-old, were asked (i) to grade the idea of virtual
   characters in electronic learning environments and (ii) to chose
   between a strictly task-oriented, socially 'shallow' and a more
   socially oriented pedagogical character. The participants were also
   asked to articulate the reasons behind their answers, and to share
   their thoughts and opinions on the issues. The results of the study, as
   well as of several of the studies reviewed, indicate that responses and
   attitudes towards social aspects of virtual pedagogical characters are
   highly divergent. In particular, the notion that social dimensions of
   virtual characters increase learners' motivation and engagement may be
   less generally applicable in a student population than is sometimes
   hypothesized. An ensuing design guideline suggests interface solutions
   with an emphasis on flexibility regarding social orientation and
   communicative style in virtual characters.

ID ICT; STUDENTS; PERSPECTIVES; SCHOOLS
AB Computer-assisted assessment (CAA) has become increasingly important in
   education in recent years. A variety of computer software systems have
   been developed to help assess the performance of students at various
   levels. However, such systems are primarily designed to provide
   objective assessment of students and analysis of test items, and focus
   has been mainly placed on higher and further education. Although there
   are commercial professional systems available for use by primary and
   secondary educational institutions, such systems are generally
   expensive and require skilled expertise to operate. In view of the
   rapid progress made in the use of computer- based assessment for
   primary and secondary students by education authorities here in the UK
   and elsewhere, there is a need to develop systems which are economic
   and easy to use and can provide the necessary information that can help
   teachers improve students' performance. This paper presents the
   development of a software system that provides a range of functions
   including generating items and building item banks, designing tests,
   conducting tests on computers and analysing test results. Specifically,
   the system can generate information on the performance of students and
   test items that can be easily used to identify curriculum areas where
   students are under performing. A case study based on data collected
   from five secondary schools in Hong Kong involved in the Curriculum,
   Evaluation and Management Centre's Middle Years Information System
   Project, Durham University, UK, has been undertaken to demonstrate the
   use of the system for diagnostic and performance analysis.

AB This paper examines current practice in the evaluation of learning
   technology in the UK and proposes a new approach informed by Activity
   Theory. It is based on our experiences of using Activity Theory to
   understand students' and lecturers' experiences of technology-based
   teaching environments. We discuss the activity of evaluating learning
   technologies in higher education, and some frameworks currently in use
   that assume an efficiency criteria for their evaluations. We use the
   evaluation criteria proposed by Breen et al. ( 2001) as a starting
   point for alternative criteria to review a number of examples of
   technology based teaching in Higher Education. We identify a need for a
   broader view of the outcomes and value of using learning technologies
   and relate this activity to a new approach based on an Activity Theory
   augmented view of evaluation.

AB The suggestion that new courses can be constructed from existing
   learning objects appears technically self-evident but remains unproven.
   Despite increasing evidence that learning objects can provide a
   suitable structure for constructing courses most evidence is based on
   creating learning objects, either through restructuring existing
   materials or as a set of newly created learning objects. There is
   little evidence for building a new course from existing learning
   objects where any significant number of these have been developed for a
   different course elsewhere. Authors who adopt a constructivist model of
   knowledge might view this lack of evidence as confirmation of the
   inherent difficulty of integrating resources created within different
   communities. Those following a scientific model of knowledge would view
   this as a temporary problem that will be resolved when a sufficient
   volume of materials exists in repositories. This paper argues that
   reconfiguration of learning objects to create new courses is
   significantly more complex than is currently recognized, even within a
   scientific framework of knowledge. By implication, far more research is
   needed to understand reconfiguration and re-integration than initial
   'creation'.

   discussion centres on three quality issues that are considered as
   critical in recent content analysis approaches: (1) the accuracy of the
   research methodology applied to gather data in CSCL-settings, (2) the
   low reliability of the research instruments and procedures, and (3)
   questions about the validity of the research instruments. Finally, the
   four contributions in the special are positioned in relation to these

AB Research in the field of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning
   (CSCL) is based on a wide variety of methodologies. In this paper, we
   focus upon content analysis, which is a technique often used to analyze
   transcripts of asynchronous, computer mediated discussion groups in
   formal educational settings. Although this research technique is often
   used, standards are not yet established. The applied instruments
   reflect a wide variety of approaches and differ in their level of
   detail and the type of analysis categories used. Further differences
   are related to a diversity in their theoretical base, the amount of
   information about validity and reliability, and the choice for the unit
   of analysis.
   This article presents an overview of different content analysis
   instruments, building on a sample of models commonly used in the
   CSCL-literature. The discussion of 15 instruments results in a number
   of critical conclusions. There are questions about the coherence
   between the theoretical base and the operational translation of the
   theory in the instruments. Instruments are hardly compared or
   contrasted with one another. As a consequence the empirical base of the
   validity of the instruments is limited. The analysis is rather critical
   when it comes to the issue of reliability. The authors put forward the
   need to improve the theoretical and empirical base of the existing
   instruments in order to promote the overall quality of CSCL-research.

AB Quantitative content analysis is increasingly used to surpass surface
   level analyses in computer-supported collaborative learning (e.g.,
   counting messages), but critical reflection on accepted practice has
   generally not been reported. A review of CSCL conference proceedings
   revealed a general vagueness in definitions of units of analysis. In
   general, arguments for choosing a unit were lacking and decisions made
   while developing the content analysis procedures were not made
   explicit. In this article, it will be illustrated that the currently
   accepted practices concerning the 'unit of meaning' are not generally
   applicable to quantitative content analysis of electronic
   communication. Such analysis is affected by 'unit boundary overlap' and
   contextual constraints having to do with the technology used. The
   analysis of e-mail communication required a different unit of analysis
   and segmentation procedure. This procedure proved to be reliable, and
   the subsequent coding of these units for quantitative analysis yielded
   satisfactory reliabilities. These findings have implications and
   recommendations for current content analysis practice in CSCL research.

AB This contribution examines the methodological challenges involved in
   defining the collaborative knowledge-building processes occurring in
   asynchronous discussion and proposes an approach that could advance
   understanding of these processes. The written protocols that are
   available to the analyst provide an exact record of the instructional
   transactions at a given time in the online discussion. On the basis of
   a study of online discussion forums used in a higher education context,
   a model for the analysis of collaborative knowledge building in
   asynchronous discussion is presented. The model allows examination of
   the communication from the multiple perspectives of interaction,
   cognition and discourse analysis. The investigation was conducted using
   a qualitative case study approach and involved an in-depth examination
   of three cases. Content analysis of the discourse was done at a number
   of levels, focusing on the discussion forum itself, the discussion
   threads, the messages, and the exchanges and moves among the messages.
   As a result of correspondences found among the variables representing
   the different levels of the analysis, the most important being the
   relationship between type of interaction, phase of critical inquiry,
   and move in the exchange structure, it was possible to build a scheme
   for assessing knowledge building in asynchronous discussion groups. The
   scheme integrates the interactive, cognitive and discourse dimensions
   in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). The study

AB Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) is often based on
   written argumentative discourse of learners, who discuss their
   perspectives on a problem with the goal to acquire knowledge. Lately,
   CSCL research focuses on the facilitation of specific processes of
   argumentative knowledge construction, e.g., with computer-supported
   collaboration scripts. In order to refine process-oriented
   instructional support, such as scripts, we need to measure the
   influence of scripts on specific processes of argumentative knowledge
   construction. In this article, we propose a multi-dimensional approach
   to analyze argumentative knowledge construction in CSCL from sampling
   and segmentation of the discourse corpora to the analysis of four
   process dimensions (participation, epistemic, argumentative, social
   mode). (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE computer-mediated-communication; computer supported collaborative

AB Computer mediated communication (CMC) refers to communication between
   individuals and among groups via networked computers. Such forms of
   communication can be asynchronous or synchronous and serve a wide
   variety of useful functions ranging from administration to building
   understanding and knowledge. As such there are many reasons for
   interest in analyzing the content of CMC. Foremost among these is the
   opportunity that the written text is able to offer for various types of
   analysis. Others have to do with the need to understand human
   communication patterns in this medium, their conventions, form and
   functions, the nature of the subtext within it, and how people derive
   meaning and understanding in such contexts. The papers in this special
   section of this journal have attempted to closely examine the subject
   of CMC content analysis. It includes examination of what is involved in
   the analysis of CMC content, schemes and frameworks for analyzing them,
   and knowledge building within such contexts. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

ID SCIENCE-EDUCATION; FEEDER COUNTS; CURRICULUM; INSTRUCTION; STANDARDS;

AB This paper focuses on an early stage of developing curricular materials
   to support students' learning of scientific inquiry. The materials
   being developed and tested, called Classroom FeederWatch (CFW), aimed
   to support science inquiry and were developed by a collaborative team
   of private curriculum developers and scientists (ornithologists).
   Inquiry dimensions were influenced at the outset by the newly released
   National Science Education Standards (National Research Council,
   Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 1996) and by prior successful
   experiences of ornithologists with inquiry experiences for adults.
   Despite hopes that CFW materials would assist middle school students to
   learn inquiry, evaluation findings showed little increase in students'
   understanding of inquiry or the ability to plan and conduct inquiry. We
   learned that improvements to inquiry dimensions of the curriculum
   required aligning activities more closely with practices that reflected
   the work of scientists in the discipline, integrating learning of
   content knowledge with learning about inquiry, and adjusting evaluation
   protocols to more accurately assess inquiry as represented in the
   Standards. Discussion highlights the influence of the Standards on
   development of inquiry dimensions of the materials, including the way
   in which initial application of the Standards to the early version of
   CFW materials may have restricted the engagement of both students and
   teachers in conducting science inquiry. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID SCIENCE MUSEUM; ENVIRONMENT; STUDENTS
AB Museums are favorite and respected resources for learning worldwide. In
   Israel, there are two relatively large science centers and a number of
   small natural history museums that are visited by thousands of
   students. Unlike other countries, studying museum visits in Israel only
   emerges in the last few years. The study focused on the roles and
   perceptions of teachers, who visited four natural history museums with
   their classes. The study followed previous studies that aimed at
   understanding the role teachers play in class visits to museums
   (Griffin & Symington, 1997, Science Education, 81, 763-779 Cox-Petersen
   et al., 2003, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 40, 200-218;
   Olsen, Cox-Petersen, & McComas, 2001. Journal of Science Teacher
   Education, 12, 155-173) and emphasized unique phenomena related to the
   Israeli system. None of the teachers interviewed for this study was an
   active facilitator. and in many cases the teachers had no idea
   regarding the field trip program and rationale. Our main findings
   support previous studies that indicated that teachers are hardly
   involved in planning and enacting the museum visit. An issue of
   concern, which came up in this study, is the tendency of Israeli
   schools to use subcontractor companies that plan and make all the
   museum arrangements. Unlike the common patterns described in the paper,
   a case study of unique teacher's function is presented as well. (c)

ID MUSEUMS; TRIP
AB This investigation sought to identify the motivations that comprise
   teachers' agendas when leading student fieldtrips to science museums or
   similar sites. A survey distributed to upper elementary teachers
   resulted in a variety of open-ended responses that were analyzed and
   coded to identify recurring themes. In addition, ten teachers planning
   to lead a school trip to a natural history museum were interviewed and
   observed. Interview and observation data were used to triangulate
   findings and refine descriptions of actual practice. Eight fieldtrip
   motivations were identified including to connect with the classroom
   curriculum, to provide a general learning experience, to encourage
   lifelong learning, to enhance interest and motivation, to provide
   exposure to new experiences, to provide a change in setting or routine,
   for enjoyment, and to meet school expectations. Results indicated that
   'connecting to the classroom curriculum' was an important
   consideration, although teachers had different interpretations of what
   this meant. Further examination of the teachers' agendas suggested the
   influence of different contexts, including that of the school and the
   museum site. These findings lead to suggestions for facilitating school
   visits to informal settings by considering the teachers' fieldtrip
   perspectives and agendas. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study explores the roles that regional partners play in helping to
   support implementation of the GLOBE program, an international earth
   science and education initiative. Researchers at SRI International
   conducted case studies of two GLOBE partners' practices in an effort to
   identify the factors that contribute to effective implementation of the
   program within a teaching approach that emphasizes student research.
   The chief finding of the case studies is that intermediary
   organizations in GLOBE help teachers both to address obstacles to
   implementing GLOBE-based student research in their classrooms and to
   align their curriculum to state standards and assessments. Such
   intermediary organizations may play similar roles in other science
   education programs, helping teachers to find ways to make nationally or
   internationally oriented science curriculum materials locally relevant
   and easy to adopt in diverse school settings. (c) 2005 Wiley

AB This case study documents an example of inquiry learning and teaching
   during a summer institute for elementary and middle school teachers. A
   small group constructed an explanatory model for an intriguing optical
   phenomenon that they were observing. Research questions included: What
   physics thinking did the learners express? What aspects of scientific
   inquiry were evident in what the learners said and did? What questions
   did the learners ask one another as they worked? How did these learners
   collaborate in constructing understanding? How did the instructor
   foster their learning? Data sources included video and audio-tapes of
   instruction, copies of the participants' writings and drawings, field
   notes, interviews, and staff reflections. An interpretative narrative
   of what three group members said and did presents a detailed account of
   their learning process. Analyses of their utterances provide evidence
   of physics thinking, scientific inquiry, questioning, collaborative
   sense making, and insight into ways to foster inquiry learning. (c)

AB The purpose of this qualitative case study was to examine the nature of
   a first-year elementary teacher's specialized practices and knowledge
   for giving priority to evidence in science teaching and to explore the
   possible sources from which this knowledge was generated. Data included
   three audiotaped interviews, six videotaped classroom observations,
   lesson plans, and samples of students' work. The findings of this study
   reveal that the teacher gave priority to evidence by frequently
   engaging students in collecting evidence through observations and
   investigations, recording and representing evidence, and using that
   evidence to construct explanations. The findings of this study also
   illustrate that critical experiences during preparation to teach and
   specific university coursework acted as sources through which the
   teacher's specialized knowledge for giving priority to evidence was
   generated. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Previous research has found a wide range of predictors of student
   performance in introductory college chemistry. These predictors are
   associated with both the students' backgrounds and their high school
   learning experiences. The purpose of this research study was to examine
   the link between high school chemistry pedagogical experiences and
   performance in introductory college chemistry while accounting for
   individual educational and demographic differences. The researchers
   surveyed 1531 students enrolled in first-semester introductory college
   chemistry courses for science and engineering majors at 12 different
   U.S. colleges and universities. Using multiple regression analysis, the
   researchers uncovered several interesting high school pedagogical
   experiences that appeared to be linked with varying levels of
   performance in college chemistry. Most notably, the researchers found
   that repeating chemistry labs for understanding was associated with
   higher student grades, whereas overemphasis on lab procedure in high
   school chemistry was associated with lower grades in college. These
   results suggest that high school teachers' pedagogical choices may have
   a link to future student performance. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID KNOWLEDGE; STUDENTS
AB A feminist action research team, which consisted of a science educator,
   an English-language learner (ELL) educator, a first-year science
   teacher, and a graduate assistant, set a goal to work together to
   explore the process a beginning teacher goes through to establish a
   classroom conducive to the needs of middle-level ELL learners. The
   guiding questions of the study were answered by gathering a wealth of
   data over the course of 5 months and taken from the classroom, planning
   sessions, and researchers and students. These data were collected by
   observations, semistructured interviews, and written document reviews.
   The progressive analysis ultimately revealed that: (a) successful
   strategies a beginning teacher must utilize for teaching middle-level
   ELL children in a mainstream classroom involve complex structural
   considerations that are not part of the teacher's preparation; (b)
   learning increases for all children, but there are differences in
   learning achievement between ELL and non-ELL children; and (c) student
   and peer feedback proved to be an effective means of enhancing the
   growth of a beginning teacher seeking to increase her skills in
   teaching ELL learners. The experiences and findings from this project
   have implications for teacher preparation programs committed to
   preparing educators to teach science to all children. (c) 2005 Wiley

AB We examined third graders' understandings of condensation using an
   expanded notion of the Emergent Perspective, a reflexive consideration
   of individual and group meaning-making situated in the culture of the
   classroom. Data were collected from two small groups of students in an
   inquiry-based, urban classroom during a unit on the water cycle.
   Measures included conceptual pre-/posttests, interviews, written work,
   and discourse analyses of a science lesson. Although we identified the
   supportive role of the teacher's explicit assessments of children's
   ideas, within the small groups, the force that most potently shaped
   meaning-making was students' persuasive power, which was in part
   influenced by the rhetorical moves employed. Specifically, students'
   evaluative comments (a type of rhetorical move) about contributions of
   other group members seemed to be particularly persuasive in these
   groups. Evaluative comments, apart from students' academic status, were
   shown to be an important influence in not only social knowledge
   production but also in individual internalization. Our explanation
   focuses on the particular discursive practices as intellectual
   resources of urban students, but we are also mindful of the cognitive
   complexity of the material and the developmental abilities of the
   students. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The study examines the effectiveness of visually enhanced instruction
   that emphasizes molecular representations. Instructional conditions
   were specified in terms of the visual elaboration level ( static and
   dynamic) and the presentation mode ( whole class and individual).
   Fifty-two eighth graders ( age range 14 - 15 years) participated in one
   of the three instructional conditions ( dynamic individual, dynamic -
   whole class, and static - whole class) designed to improve molecular
   understanding on chemical change. The results indicated significantly
   higher performance for students who used dynamic visuals compared with
   those who used static visuals. Furthermore, students who used dynamic
   visuals on an individual basis were more consistent in their use of
   molecular representations compared with students who received
   whole-class instruction with dynamic or static visuals. The results
   favour the use of dynamic visuals ( preferably on an individual basis)
   over static visuals when presenting molecular representations. The
   results also imply that the effectiveness of instruction will improve
   if teachers challenge and question the inconsistencies and
   contradictions between verbal explanations and corresponding molecular
   representations.

   Two matched groups in a primary school in Greece ( ages 10/11, n = 20
   and n = 19) were respectively taught one of two parallel lesson
   schemes. Covering the same phenomena, one scheme incorporated particle
   ideas, and the other did not. Data were collected pre and post
   intervention through individual interviews ( n = 24). Results suggest
   that pupils' understanding benefited from the introduction of particle
   ideas. Implications for the primary science curriculum are discussed.

AB The potential value of a multiple-choice question-construction
   instructional strategy for the support of students' learning of physics
   experiments was examined in the study. Forty-two university freshmen
   participated in the study for a whole semester. A constant comparison
   method adopted to categorize students' qualitative data indicated that
   the influences of multiple-choice question construction were evident in
   several significant ways ( promoting constructive and productive
   studying habits; reflecting and previewing course-related materials;
   increasing in-group communication and interaction; breaking passive
   learning style and habits, etc.), which, worked together, not only
   enhanced students' comprehension and retention of the obtained
   knowledge, but also helped distil a sense of empowerment and learning
   community within the participants. Analysis with one-group t-tests,
   using 3 as the expected mean, on quantitative data further found that
   students' satisfaction toward past learning experience, and perceptions
   toward this strategy's potentials for promoting learning were
   statistically significant at the 0.0005 level, while learning anxiety
   was not statistically significant. Suggestions for incorporating
   question-generation activities within classroom and topics for future
   studies were rendered.

AB This paper investigates the views of science and scientific activity
   that can be found in chemistry textbooks and heard from teachers when
   acid - base reactions are introduced to grade 12 and university
   chemistry students. First, the main macroscopic and microscopic
   conceptual models are developed. Second, we attempt to show how the
   existence of views of science in textbooks and of chemistry teachers
   contributes to an impoverished image of chemistry. A varied design has
   been elaborated to analyse some epistemological deficiencies in
   teaching acid - base reactions. Textbooks have been analysed and
   teachers have been interviewed. The results obtained show that the
   teaching process does not emphasize the macroscopic presentation of
   acids and bases. Macroscopic and microscopic conceptual models involved
   in the explanation of acid - base processes are mixed in textbooks and
   by teachers. Furthermore, the non-problematic introduction of concepts,
   such as the hydrolysis concept, and the linear, cumulative view of acid
   - base theories ( Arrhenius and Bronsted) were detected.

ID COURSES
AB The School of Physics at the University of Sydney has introduced
   voluntary workshop tutorials in large first-year courses. The tutorials
   are based on informal cooperative groupings with structured worksheets
   and short hands-on activities. In this study we explore the
   relationship between attendance at the workshop tutorials and student
   performance in examinations. We show that about 80% of the students
   attend more than two-thirds of the voluntary tutorials. Discounting the
   students who attend very few tutorials, on average, examination marks
   improve significantly with increased tutorial attendance. In
   particular, on average, students with poor senior high school scores
   have significantly better examination marks if they work in the same
   group for eight or more tutorials than those who do not work in the
   same groups. There is evidence that the improvement in examination
   performance is more pronounced in qualitative concept questions, most
   dramatically again for students who did poorly in senior high school.

ID SCIENTIFIC LITERACY; SCHOOL SCIENCE
AB The present research was designed to investigate the reaction of
   secondary school students to the communication code that the press uses
   in science articles: it attempts to trace which communication
   techniques can be of potential use in science education. The sample of
   the research consists of 351 secondary school students. The research
   instrument is a questionnaire, which attempts to trace students'
   preferences regarding newspaper science articles, to explore students'
   attitudes towards the science articles published in the press and to
   investigate students' reactions towards four newspaper science
   articles. These articles deal with different aspects of science and
   reflect different communication strategies. The results of the research
   reveal that secondary school students view the communication codes used
   in press science articles as being more interesting and comprehensible
   than those of their science textbooks. Predominantly, they do not
   select science articles that present their data in a scientific way (
   diagrams and abstract graphs). On the contrary, they do select science
   articles and passages in them, which use an emotional/`poetic' language
   with a lot of metaphors and analogies to introduce complex science
   concepts. It also seems that the narrative elements found in
   popularized science articles attract students' interest and motivate
   them towards further reading.

ID ORDER THINKING SKILLS; EDUCATION; PROJECT; CURRICULUM; STUDENTS; MODEL
AB Reform efforts are often unsuccessful because they failed to understand
   that teachers play a key role in making educational reforms successful.
   This paper describes a long-term teacher professional development (PD)
   program aimed at educating and training teachers to teach
   interdisciplinary topics using case-based method in science. The
   research objective was to identify, follow and document the processes
   that science teachers went through as they assimilated the
   interdisciplinary, case-based science teaching approach. The research
   accompanied the PD program throughout its 3-year period. About 50
   teachers, who took part in the PD program, were exposed to an
   interdisciplinary case-based teaching method. The research instruments
   included teacher portfolios, which contained projects and reflection
   questionnaires, classroom observations, teacher interviews, and student
   feedback questionnaires. The portfolios contained the projects that the
   teachers had carried out during the PD program, which included case
   studies and accompanying student activities. We found that the teachers
   gradually moved from exposure to new teaching methods and subject
   matter, through active learning and preparing case-based team projects,
   to interdisciplinary, active classroom teaching using the case studies
   they developed.

ID UNDERSTANDING IMAGE-FORMATION; CHILDRENS CONCEPTIONS; PRIOR KNOWLEDGE;
   VISION; OPTICS; MIRROR
AB This paper is focused on primary trainee teachers' conceptualization of
   the vision process and image formation in a plane mirror. The study
   involved 55 non-specialist, undergraduate trainee primary teachers on a
   4-year programme of initial teacher training. The process incorporated
   tracking trainees' ideas during university-taught sessions through
   collating and analysing responses to set tasks that included both the
   interpretation of annotated diagrams of the vision process and
   diagrammatic representation of image formation in a plane mirror. A
   selected sample of trainees was also interviewed. The data indicate
   that trainees experience significant difficulties in articulating
   coherent explanations regarding basic ideas about light. This presents
   particular professional constraint within the current demands of the
   primary initial teacher training science curriculum. It is argued that
   a more productive approach would be to focus on the professional issue
   of pedagogy through raising trainees' awareness of the conceptual
   difficulties in learning rather than the current curriculum focus that
   seems to privilege knowing over understanding.

TI Rationale and approaches for embedding scientific literacy into the new
   Junior Secondary School Chemistry Curriculum in the People's Republic
   of China
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE
AB Taking the recently released Junior Secondary School Chemistry
   Curriculum (JSSCC) in the People's Republic of China as a case, this
   paper approaches the issue of how to realize the idea of scientific
   literacy within a secondary school science curriculum. Subject matter
   and its companion meanings were used as the framework to explore the
   embedding of scientific literacy. Two methods were employed in this
   study: document analyses and interviews with key informants involved in
   designing the new JSSCC. From the analysis of the curriculum documents
   relevant to the JSSCC, it is evident that the idea of scientific
   literacy has been reflected substantially in the new JSSCC. The
   embedding of scientific literacy can be explained with reference to
   sociopolitical background and the national curriculum policies at the
   macro-level, and to the roles played by chemistry educators, in lieu of
   academic chemists, at the micro-level. This paper provides an example
   of curriculum reform in which principles associated with scientific
   literacy are embedded in the formal curriculum.

AB This paper presents the results of part of an investigation carried out
   with fourth-level Spanish secondary education students ( 15 years old),
   in which we implemented a teaching unit based on problem-solving
   methodology as an investigation to teach genetics and human inheritance
   curricular contents. By solving open problems, the students experienced
   a conceptual restructuring that stayed with them over time and involved
   the following specific theories: the location of hereditary
   information, the transmission of hereditary information, and the
   appearance of new characteristic. The learning connections between
   these specific theories were also studied. Furthermore, these results
   were compared with a control group that worked with closed problems,
   the usual approach to genetics teaching in Spanish classrooms.
   Consequently, we were able to verify that our methodology results in
   better learning.

AB The concept of a community of practice (CoP) is prevalent in several
   venues for teachers' professional development, especially in online
   environments. However, there are few descriptive accounts that
   effectively represent a CoP in a manner that will be of use to other
   designers. In order to illuminate potential difficulties which may
   arise when attempting to design a framework to characterize or to build
   a CoP, this study describes the dynamics of five dualities (specific
   areas of tension) that were identified during the design and testing
   period of the Inquiry Learning Forum (ILF), a Web-based community for
   teachers' professional development. During the three-year design
   trajectory of the ILF, these five dualities emerged from and
   characterized the interactions between the participating teachers and
   the site designers. As part of the data collection for this study, we
   conducted document analyses, interviews with designers, researchers,
   and teachers, and observations of online and face-to-face meetings. The
   findings of this study are intended to help future Web-designers both
   to better realize the full potential of online professional development
   environments and to avoid potential design development issues which may
   hamper the utility or participation rates in newly created CoPs.

AB Perceptions related to "educational technology" have been continuously
   changing throughout the century. At this point, educational technology
   seems to be a confusing or an incomprehensible concept for most people.
   Perceptions of professional educational technologists in the relevant
   field can provide individuals who build their career in the relevant
   area with various perspectives. Also practices related to educational
   technology and relevant opinions of professionals can provide a guiding
   outline for the research activities being conducted in the field. This
   research was conducted to reveal how educational technology is
   perceived as a discipline, and how opinions about applications of
   educational technology in various countries differ. A total of 71
   professionals from 12 universities in six countries participated in
   this research, implemented through survey method. Results support the
   idea that functions of the educational technology in various areas are
   mostly related to learning-teaching processes, and learning resources.
   Professional opinions on current status of the discipline reflect that
   there are no considerable differences related to the problems being
   experienced among different countries.

AB Eighty-one female and sixty-seven male undergraduates at a Malaysian
   university, from seven faculties and a Center for Language Studies
   completed a Computer Self-Efficacy Scale, Computer Anxiety Scale, and
   an Attitudes toward the Internet Scale and give information about their
   use of the Internet. This survey research investigated undergraduates'
   computer anxiety, computer self-efficacy, and reported use of and
   attitudes toward the Internet. This study also examined differences in
   computer anxiety, computer self-efficacy, attitudes toward the Internet
   and reported use of the Internet for undergraduates with different
   demographic variables. The findings suggest that the undergraduates had
   moderate computer anxiousness, medium attitudes toward the Internet,
   and high computer self-efficacy and used the Internet extensively for
   educational purposes such as doing research, downloading electronic
   resources and e-mail communications. This study challenges the long
   perceived male bias in the computer environment and supports recent
   studies that have identified greater gender equivalence in interest,
   use, and skills levels. However, there were differences in
   undergraduates' Internet usage levels based on the discipline of study.
   Furthermore, higher levels of Internet usage did not necessarily
   translate into better computer self-efficacy among the undergraduates.
   A more important factor in determining computer self-efficacy could be
   the discipline of study and undergraduates studying computer related
   disciplines appeared to have higher self-efficacy towards computers and
   the Internet. Undergraduates who used the Internet more often may not
   necessarily feel more comfortable using them. Possibly, other factors
   such as the types of application used, the purpose for using, and
   individual satisfaction could also influence computer self-efficacy and
   computer anxiety. However, although Internet usage levels may not have
   any impact on computer self-efficacy, higher usage of the Internet does
   seem to decrease the levels of computer anxiety among the
   undergraduates. Undergraduates with lower computer anxiousness
   demonstrated more positive attitudes toward the Internet in this study.

AB In recent years, the information and communication technology (ICT) has
   created a significant impact on the methods of communicating
   information and knowledge to the learners and, consequently, innovative
   teaching techniques have evolved to change the way teachers teach and
   students learn.
   In this paper, the focus is on a study which was conducted on a
   group-based cooperative learning class to determine its impact on
   student learning and the reactions of these learners towards this
   instructional methodology. The students in the course were given a
   web-based multimedia-mediated cooperative learning project to complete.
   Students worked in groups and used multimedia and web technologies to
   construct their projects. As such, a technology-supported cooperative
   learning framework was established. A survey was conducted to ascertain
   the reactions of the students towards this mode of teaching and
   learning.
   Results of the study showed that in group-based learning, students
   learned by cooperating and interacting with each other and participated
   actively in their own learning process. Students also learned to
   cultivate teamwork, communication, management and interpersonal skills.
   Furthermore, by incorporating a multimedia project into the cooperative
   learning structure, a viable and effective strategy was created to
   enhance student learning.

AB In order to realize one of the most important necessities of the life,
   which is learning, the human being spends most of their life for
   education-training activities. In the conventional applications, every
   individual, being a part of a group is dependant on a single program
   and an educational management which was chosen for the group by the
   teacher. However, each student has individual learning abilities,
   different from other members of the group. At the end of the teaching
   activities with one group, nearly all of the individuals of that group
   are expected to be successful. This study was performed at the
   Technical Education Faculty of F1rat University in Elazig during
   2002-2003 autumn term in order to determine the effects of this mastery
   learning model on the success of the students who attended the "Usage
   of Basic Information Technologies" course. The findings gained in this
   research show that being a significant difference in experiment group
   favour on the points of final test and achievement points. (The
   findings of the study show a significant difference in favor of the
   experimental group, versus the control group, in both the final test
   scores and achievement points.) In experimental group, mastery learning
   model was used. Therefore, it was seen that mastery learning model
   increased the student achievement effectively.

   readiness
AB In order to benefit from e-learning, companies should conduct
   considerable up-front analysis to assess their readiness. There are a
   number of instruments in the market that can be used for assessing
   readiness for e-learning. However, almost all of these instruments are
   developed to be used in countries that have a mature field of human
   resources development. So, these instruments consist of terms, phrases,
   and applications that are meaningless for many companies in especially
   emerging countries where human resources development field has just
   shown an improvement. This article includes the description of a survey
   instrument that has been developed to assess e-learning readiness of
   companies in these kinds of countries and the results of a study that
   examines organizational readiness of companies for e-learning in
   Turkey. The study reveals that companies surveyed are overall ready for
   e-learning but they need to improve need to improve themselves,
   particularly in the area of human resources, in order to be able to
   successfully implement e-learning. Although this instrument has been
   developed according to the cultural characteristics of Turkish
   companies it can easily be adapted to be used by companies of other
   emerging countries.

TI Teaching reflection to nursing students: a qualitative study in an
   Irish context
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
ID CRITICAL INCIDENT ANALYSIS; EDUCATION; THINKING; ISSUES
AB Teaching nursing students to reflect on their practice is now
   officially considered an essential component of nursing education in a
   number of countries. The aim of this study was to explore nurse
   teachers' perceptions and experiences of using reflection with diploma
   nursing students in an Irish context. One of the central themes to
   emerge, upon which this article is based, is the manner in which
   reflection is actually taught and/or facilitated by nurse educators in
   diploma nursing programmes, and the factors that influence this.
   Intensive interviews were conducted with 11 nurse teachers and data
   were analysed using a strategy resembling grounded theory. Findings
   indicated that the teaching of reflection was influenced by structural
   and human resource requirements and a lack of organisational commitment
   within the schools of nursing. Reflective practice did not permeate
   throughout the curriculum, but was instead an isolated, episodic
   classroom activity. The prospect of integrating reflective practice, as
   taught in the schools, with nursing practice in the clinical realms was
   problematic because of a range of cultural impediments. The repressive
   culture within the schools of nursing seemed to subvert discussion and
   debate about the status of reflective practice in the nursing
   curriculum.

TI Teaching as a focussed conversation: the use of incentive-based
   preparation exercises
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB In this case note I report on the introduction of incentive-based
   preparation exercises into my law teaching. These exercises require
   students, at each seminar class, to hand in a written summary of their
   responses to focussed questions on course materials. These questions
   are directly related to the work required for the final assessment in
   the course. The preparation exercises are marked and returned at the
   following class, and a percentage of the final mark is assigned to
   students who complete the preparation exercises and attend the
   seminars. These exercises are based on the conception of teaching as a
   conversation involving dialogue between teacher, student and subject
   area, with a central focus on assessment requirements. In this case
   note I outline the factors that prompted this initiative, namely the
   uneven engagement of students in seminars and the lack of formative
   assessment to prepare students for final assessment. I present the main
   features and rationales of the initiative and the strategies for
   evaluating it. My conclusion is that the initiative significantly
   improves student engagement and provides an effective means of
   formative assessment. At the same time, certain issues require
   attention as an ongoing part of the conversation of teaching.

AB This paper presents aspects of good practice in international teaching.
   The paper incorporates a review of literature on international
   teaching, quality assurance in collaborative provision, and selected
   literature from the Human Resource Management field on expatriate
   workers. Primary data have been drawn from two sources. Qualitative
   data have been gathered in relation to a one-semester exercise
   involving 24 colleagues in a 12-week teaching period in Israel.
   Secondly, qualitative data have been gathered from key informant
   interviews with colleagues with experience of shorter teaching periods
   overseas. The paper identifies aspects of good practice, and presents
   issues for further research. Key findings include the need for careful
   selection of staff, cultural sensitivity in both delivery and content
   of programmes, and particularly effective working relationships between
   visiting lecturers and local staff as key to effective classroom
   performance. Finally, UK higher education institutions, while urged to
   'think global', should ensure that they 'teach local', meeting student
   needs through cultural sensitivity and appropriate pedagogy.

AB A web-based learning system has been developed to facilitate
   question-posing, peer-assessing, item-viewing and drill-and-practice
   learning activities. In this paper, the pedagogical basis underlying
   the design and development of the system is explained in the light of
   information-processing theory, social construction of knowledge theory
   and social modelling theory. A preliminary study to evaluate the
   instructional potential of the system has been conducted; this has also
   identified the factors that influence students' use of the system.
   Results taken from questionnaires and open-ended questions revealed
   that by enabling students to play various roles such as composers,
   critics and adapters, the system was perceived as a cognition-enhancing
   and motivational learning tool by the participants. Data analysis
   further indicated that various factors worked together to influence the
   performance of question-posing.

   collaboration in group projects. It supports interactive and
   collaborative structured-diagramming and is equipped with group
   awareness features such as remote cursors, locking, and text-based
   instant messaging. Users can access WOTS from both personal computers
   and handheld devices, allowing it to be used in wireless classrooms or
   distributed environments. Tests on student software design projects
   validate the ability of WOTS to support student collaboration in group
   projects, and show that its architecture is scalable and reliable. Its
   performance is expected to improve as more powerful handheld devices
   and wireless technologies come on to the market.
