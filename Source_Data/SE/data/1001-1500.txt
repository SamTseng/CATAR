AB Taking advantage of the continuously improving, web-based learning
   systems plays an important role for self-learning, especially in the
   case of working people. Nevertheless, learning systems do not generally
   adapt to learners' profiles. Learners have to spend a lot of time
   before reaching the learning goal that is compatible with their
   knowledge background. To overcome such difficulties, an e-learning
   schema is introduced that adapts to the learners' ICT (Information and
   Communication Technologies) knowledge level. The IEEE Reference Model
   (WG 1) defined by the Learning Technology Standards Committee (LTSA) is
   extended and used for this purpose. The proposed approach is based on
   the usage of electronic questionnaires (e-questionnaires) designed by a
   group of experts. Through the automatic analysis of the learners'
   responses to the questionnaires, all learners are assigned to different
   learner profiles. According to these profiles they are served with
   learning material that best matches their educational needs. We have
   implemented our approach in five European countries and the overall
   case study illustrates very promising results. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the growing popularity of computers and the Internet, most
   teachers are taking advantage of Internet functions to assist in both
   teaching and student learning. However, students only login to the
   assisted learning system once or twice a week on average to surf for
   relevant references, participate in discussions, or hand in
   assignments, even though information and interaction are greatly
   enhanced by these online services. Therefore, increasing the transfer
   rate of useful information and interaction during the course period
   would help students learn. To this end, we designed an e-news delivery
   system that sends personalized e-mails to every student's mailbox to
   make information access and peer interaction more convenient and
   efficient. Through the daily habit of using e-mail, students can
   receive the latest information, new instructions or peer discussions
   early. To encourage usage of the system, a user friendly interface was
   designed. The e-news system takes advantage of webpage hyperlinks to
   allow students to click on interesting topics while reading e-news;
   doing so will cause another window to pop-up with detailed content
   retrieved from the web-based learning system. A mouse-click allows
   students to login to the web-based learning system and extract the
   details of the chosen topic. To enhance the efficiency of e-news,
   learners' needs and interests were taken into consideration when
   forming the e-news content. Students' learning status and reading
   preferences are assessed to determine which information or content to
   include in the e-news. Experiment results reveal that c-news and
   personalized information greatly promote the reading of new information
   and participation in online activities. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Simulation-based educational products are excellent set of illustrative
   tools that proffer features like visualization of the dynamic behavior
   of a real system, etc. Such products have great efficacy in education
   and are known to be one of the first-rate student centered learning
   methodologies. These products allow students to practice skills such as
   critical thinking and decision-making. In this paper, a case is
   presented where a scenario-based e-learning product namely 'supply
   chain simulator' is developed at KFUPM for an introductory technology
   course. The product simulates a supply chain - a network of facilities
   and distribution systems that carries out the task of procurement and
   transformation of materials from manufacturer to customer. The product
   was put to test during four semesters and results of the survey
   conducted by the instructors and the students are presented. The
   results clearly suggest the benefits of using such a tool in enhancing
   student learning. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Problem-based learning is a goal directed and constructive process for
   learners. When meeting problems, learners usually force themselves to
   form work groups in order to find a solution. Currently, blogs are
   becoming more popular and in fact has formed a community wherein people
   can share their learning experiences with others. Many pedagogical
   applications have adopted what are posted in the community for
   supplementary learning. Integrating blogs in an intelligent tutoring
   system means that learners can better regulate and enhance their own
   learning. In this study, a novel learning device, a blog-based dynamic
   learning map, which employs both information retrieval and automated
   scheduling techniques, is designed to provide useful blog articles to
   help learning. The relevant articles in blogs are used to promote
   learner engagement in their interactions with the teaming map and hence
   achieve their goals more easily. An experimental course has been
   implemented and the results show that learners make use of the
   blog-based learning aid in a very positive way and can eventually cross
   the specified threshold in a test. The proposed approach can
   encapsulate the dynamic learning principles in cohesive and supportive
   ways. Thus it can lead learners to gain useful supplementary materials,
   shorten the learning time and offering expanded alternative viewpoints
   to use in the solution of assigned problems. Our results show that both
   the learners and lectures are very positive to the design of our
   blog-based dynamic learning map. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The idea of 'interpretative flexibility' underpins new approaches to
   studying technological artefacts and curricular resources in use. This
   paper opens by reviewing - in this light - the evolving design of
   dynamic geometry, its pioneering use within classroom projects, and
   early sketches of its mainstream use in ordinary classrooms. After
   examining curricular context and its instrumental dimension, the paper
   then reports a study of teacher constructions of dynamic geometry in
   classroom practice, conducted in professionally well-regarded
   mathematics departments in English secondary schools. From departmental
   focus-group interviews, four teacher-nominated examples of successful
   practice were selected for study in depth through lesson observation
   and post-lesson interview. Iterative thematic analysis was employed,
   first to establish a narrative outline of each case, and then the ideas
   and issues salient across cases. The study illustrates the
   interpretative flexibility surrounding the emergent use of dynamic
   geometry. It found important differences in practical elaboration of
   the widespread idea of employing dynamic geometry to support guided
   discovery. The process of evaluating the costs and benefits of student
   software use was influenced by the extent to which such use was seen as
   providing experience of a mathematical reference model, and more
   fundamentally as promoting mathematically disciplined interaction.
   Approaches to handling apparent mathematical anomalies of software
   operation depended on whether these were seen as providing
   opportunities to develop students' mathematical understanding, in line
   with a more fundamental pedagogical orientation towards supporting
   learning through analysis of mathematical discrepancies. Such variation
   was associated with differences in positioning dynamic geometry in
   relation to curricular norms and in privileging a mathematical register
   for ftaming figural properties. Across all cases, however,
   incorporating dynamic manipulation into mathematical discourse moved
   implicitly beyond established norms when dragging was used to focus
   attention on continuous dynamic variation, rather than being treated as
   an efficient means of generating multiple static figures. (C) 2007

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships of the
   students' perceived levels of collaborative learning, social presence
   and overall satisfaction in a blended learning environment. This
   research studied the relationship of these three variables and
   identified critical factors related to them. The participants were 48
   graduate students who took a blended-format course in health education
   and worked on a collaborative group project related to the development
   of a comprehensive HIV-AIDS prevention plan. Data was collected from
   the Student Perception Questionnaire and face-to-face interviews. The
   analysis of quantitative data indicated that student perceptions of
   collaborative learning have statistically positive relationships with
   perceptions of social presence and satisfaction. This means that
   students who perceived high levels of collaborative learning tended to
   be more satisfied with their distance course than those who perceived
   low levels of collaborative learning. Similarly, students with high
   perceptions of collaborative learning perceived high levels of social
   presence as well. Surprisingly, the relationship between social
   presence and overall satisfaction was positive but not statistically
   significant. Interview data revealed that (a) course structure, (b)
   emotional support, and (c) communication medium were critical factors
   associated with student perceptions of collaborative learning, social
   presence, and satisfaction. Explanations about findings and
   implications for instructional design are discussed in the conclusion.

AB With the rapid development in Information Technology (IT), the Internet
   has become one of the central media for conducting learning. However,
   most of the existing web-based learning systems only provide
   stand-alone subject materials for browsing and may face some drawbacks.
   For example, if students encounter problems during the learning
   process, their learning performances could be significantly devastated
   due to no instant aid. As an on-line learning system may interact with
   thousands of students, it is almost impossible for the teachers or the
   teaching assistants to answer all the students' questions manually,
   which is not only inefficient, but also human laborious. To cope with
   this problem, an e-learning system that is able to automatically.
   answer the students' questions on the fly based on the training cases
   given by the teacher will be presented in this paper. Moreover, an
   enhanced genetic approach is proposed to optimize the weights of
   keywords for each candidate answer according to the feedbacks provided
   by the students, hence more accurate answers can be provided in the
   future. Experimental results have shown that the developed system can
   provide more accurate answerers than existing approaches by employing
   the self-adjusting method. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the effects of a highly rated commercial electronic
   book (e-book) for young children on kindergarteners' emergent literacy
   skills within the context of paired peer versus individual use of the
   e-book. The sample of 110 kindergarteners had a mean age of 5.64 years
   and approximately equal numbers of boys and girls, randomly chosen from
   four kindergartens in a low SES Israeli township. All participants
   spoke Hebrew. None had been diagnosed with learning disabilities.
   Participants were randomly assigned to four groups: 30 tutors, 30
   tutees, and 30 individual learners, all of whom used the e-book, and 20
   children in a control group who were only exposed to their regular
   kindergarten program. Pre- and post-intervention emergent literacy
   measures included phonological awareness, reading of words from the
   e-book, word recognition, and story comprehension and production. The
   overall improvement in the measured emergent literacy skills from pre-
   to post-intervention of the children in the three experimental groups
   was higher than that of the children in the control group. In addition,
   there were significant learning context differences in several of the
   children's measured emergent literacy skills, suggesting that those who
   work on an e-book activity in a paired peer learning context with same
   age peers (tutors and tutees). seem to gain an advantage in
   phonological awareness, emergent reading, and story comprehension over
   those who work with it individually. Implications for educators and
   e-book designers are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB Educational data mining is an emerging discipline, concerned with
   developing methods for exploring the unique types of data that come
   from the educational context. This work is a survey of the specific
   application of data mining in learning management systems and a case
   study tutorial with the Moodle system. Our objective is to introduce it
   both theoretically and practically to all users interested in this new
   research area, and in particular to online instructors and e-learning
   administrators. We describe the full process for mining e-learning data
   step by step as well as how to apply the main data mining techniques

AB Using a socio-historical perspective to explain social interaction and
   taking advantage of information and communication technologies (ICTs)
   currently available for creating digital learning environments (DLEs),
   this paper seeks to redress the absence of empirical data concerning
   technology-aided social interaction between autistic individuals. In
   terms of social interaction, autism can be likened to the negative of a
   photograph and it is currently one of the most disturbing and
   challenging syndromes. This study puts forward another viewpoint on the
   processes of interaction and mediation established in digital
   environments. Based on a 3-year multi-case study, which observed groups
   of autistic individuals in DLE-aided interaction activities, it
   identifies relevant technological categories that have an important
   contribution to make in the areas involved (Psychology, Education and
   Computer Science) in the development of a digital learning environment
   that takes the results achieved into account. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Comprehensive evaluation criteria for English learning websites using

SO COMPUTERS & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE teaching/learning strategies; distributed learning environments;
   human-computer interface; interactive learning environments
AB This study aimed to develop a set of evaluation criteria for English
   learning websites. These criteria can assist English teachers/web
   designers in designing effective websites for their English courses and
   can also guide English learners in screening for appropriate and
   reliable websites to use in increasing their English ability. To
   fulfill our objective, we employed a three-phase research procedure:
   (a) establishing a preliminary set of criteria from a thorough review
   of the literature, (b) evaluating and refining the preliminary criteria
   by conducting interviews with in-service teachers and learners, and (c)
   validating and finalizing the criteria according to expert validity
   surveys. The established criteria have 46 items, classified into 6
   categories (the number of items within the category) - general
   information (12), integrated English learning (13), listening (4),
   speaking (6), reading (5), and writing (6). The general information
   evaluates the authority, accuracy, and format of the learning websites.
   The integrated English learning evaluates the overall information
   relevant to English learning materials as well as the common features
   of the four language skills. The criteria for listening, speaking,
   reading, and writing, for example, examine the suitable intonation,
   skills of discourse, classification of reading articles by their
   attributes, and the proper use of discussion boards for students when
   practicing their writing skills. Based on qualitative and quantitative
   analysis of the interviews and expert validity surveys, we confirmed
   the effectiveness of the developed evaluation criteria with
   satisfactory indexes of inter-rater reliability, content validity, and
   factorial validity. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the effect of computer-assisted instruction on
   conceptual understanding of chemical bonding and attitude toward
   chemistry was investigated. The study employed a quasi-experimental
   design involving I I grade students; 25 in an experimental and 25 in a
   control group. The Chemical Bonding Achievement Test (CBAT) consisting
   of 15 two-tier questions and the Chemistry Attitude Scale (CAS)
   consisting of 25 item were the principal data collection tools used.
   The CBAT and CAS instruments were administered in the form of a
   pre-test and post-test. Analyses of scores of the two groups in the
   post-test were compared and a statistically significant difference was
   found between groups in favor of experimental group. It also seems
   students from the experimental group were more successful than the
   control group students in remediation of alternative conceptions. The
   results of this study suggest that teaching-learning of topics in
   chemistry related to chemical bonding can be improved by the use of
   computer-assisted teaching materials. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The paper reports on a Department of Culture, Museums and Sport (DCMS)
   funded project which provided modest amounts of time for teachers to be
   freed from their classroom teaching to explore the use of information
   and communications technology (ICT) in their subject teaching, and to
   meet up together to discuss their use of new technology. The funding
   was sufficient to provide a day of supply cover for two groups of
   secondary teachers in different curriculum subjects (history and
   science) to meet towards the start of the academic year to discuss
   their use of ICT, a day of supply cover to work on their ideas and
   interests, and a day to meet together again towards the end of the year
   to share ideas and experiences.
   The rationale behind the project was to allow teachers the freedom to
   explore their own areas of interest in the area of ICT and to avoid a
   prescriptive or 'coverage' based approach. There was a conscious
   attempt to avoid target setting and audits and teachers were encouraged
   to come to the end of year meeting even if they had nothing 'to put on
   the table'.
   The concluding section of the paper describes the outcomes of the
   project. The main issue to emerge was the highly positive reaction of
   the teachers involved. Whilst for some there were significant ICT
   outputs, all those involved found the process useful and enjoyable,
   especially the collaborative sharing process in the final session. This
   was in marked contrast to other ICT training experiences which many of
   the teachers had been involved with. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Teacher assessment literacy is a key factor in the success of teaching,
   but some studies concluded that teachers lack it. The aim of this
   research is to propose the "Practicing, Reflecting and Revising with
   WATA system (P2R-WATA) Assessment Literacy Development Model" for
   improving pre-service teacher assessment literacy. WATA system offers
   personalized learning resources and opportunities for pre-service
   teachers to assemble tests and administer them to students on-line.
   Furthermore, WATA system facilitates performance of test analysis and
   item analysis, and enables pre-service teachers to review statistical
   information from the test and item analyses to revise test items. Sixty
   pre-service teachers participated in this research. The research
   results indicate that pre-service teachers using P2R-WATA Assessment
   Literacy Development Model have better effectiveness in improving their
   assessment knowledge and assessment perspectives. (c) 2007 Elsevier

AB Internet contributes to the development of science and facilitates
   scientific demeanors while it also serves as a ground for academic
   misdemeanors. Recent studies indicate that Internet facilitates and
   spreads academic dishonesty. The purpose of the current study is to
   investigate the extent of involvement of Turkish university students in
   academic dishonesty practices facilitated through Internet (i.e.
   e-dishonesty) and to question the conditions which lead to
   e-dishonesty. Three hundred and forty nine education faculty students
   from the most populated state university in Turkey were administered
   two Likert-Scale questionnaires developed by the researchers. After the
   reliability and validity conditions were met, two exploratory factor
   analyses were conducted. The first one revealed the factors
   constituting common types of e-dishonesty among undergraduate students
   which were fraudulence, plagiarism, falsification, delinquency, and
   unauthorized help. The second factor analysis exhibited individual and
   contextual factors triggering e-dishonesty which were named as
   individual factors, institutional policies and peer pressure. Results
   of both analyses are discussed and suggestions for further research are
   provided. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   implemented. The effectiveness of the hybrid instruction in regard to
   students' achievement, knowledge retention, attitudes towards the
   subject, and course satisfaction was evaluated in comparison to
   traditional classroom instruction. Experimental study with pre-test,
   post-test control group design was carried out. The sample of the study
   consisted of 50 university students enrolled in "Computer Networks and
   Communication" course. The control and experimental groups composed of
   24 and 26 students respectively, and the experiment lasted 14 weeks.
   The findings of the study indicated no significant difference between
   the hybrid course and the traditional course in students' achievement,
   knowledge retention, satisfaction, and attitude. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB User modeling has been found to enhance the effectiveness and/or
   usability of software systems through the representation of certain
   properties of a particular user. This paper presents the research and
   the results of the development of a user modeling system for the
   implementation of student models within e-learning environments,
   utilizing vector space models. The central challenge has been to
   exploit the possibilities of IUI research on user models without
   compromising the performance of the overall system. The research
   described in this paper has aimed to augment the user interface of an
   existing e-learning environment with relevant aspects from the domain
   of intelligent user interfaces, through developing a student modeling
   component. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   this study is an educational technology course for pre-service P-12
   teacher education students. Specifically, this study presents student
   reports of how cognitive apprenticeship methods impacted student
   learning processes of (a) technology skills and (b) technology
   integration methods for teaching. The methodological framework for this
   qualitative investigation is an interpretive case study. Student
   reflections and teacher observations revealed that students found
   modeling, coaching, scaffolding, and exploration key to fostering skill
   knowledge, and they found the use of cognitive apprenticeship methods
   fostered an understanding of integrating technology for teaching and

AB A novel instructional computer simulation that incorporates a dynamic
   analogy to represent Le Chatelier's Principle was designed to
   investigate the contribution of this feature to students'
   understanding. Two groups of 12th grade Chemistry students (n = 15)
   interacted with the computer simulation during the study. Both groups
   did the same pre-instructional and simulation activities except one of
   the groups interacted with the analogical example in the simulation and
   the other group was asked to recall an analogy that was presented in
   the form of text and pictures. A statistical analysis of the tests
   administered at the end of the study suggested that analogies that are
   dynamic, interactive, and integrated in a computer simulation may have
   a stronger effect on learning outcomes than analogies which are
   presented in the form of text and static pictures. The implication of
   this study for science educators is that dynamic computer-based
   analogies can enhance student learning of unobservable phenomena in
   science. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional hypermedia applications present the same content and
   provide identical navigational support to all users. Adaptive
   Hypermedia Systems (AHS) make it possible to construct personalized
   presentations to each user, according to preferences and needs
   identified. We present in this paper an alternative approach to
   educational AHS where a virtual character personalizes the interaction
   with the user through the use of a particular recommender system. The
   character has natural language communication abilities; it can learn
   students' profiles and use this knowledge to recommend appropriate
   contents and activities. Through its interaction with the user, the
   character is able to collect and organize information about students in
   order to identify appropriate suggestions of contents. The recommender
   system employs a knowledge representation scheme that is easy to
   understand and to modify, enabling teachers/tutors to explore the types
   of recommendations being made and to appreciate why they are made. An
   experiment with computer science students was carried out in order to
   validate the approach proposed. The results of the experiment showed
   that the presentation of personalized links through a virtual character
   had a positive impact in the users' perception of the system as a
   learning tool. The combination of the virtual character with a
   recommender system proved to be a good alternative for the delivery of
   personalized contents without making constant changes in the main user
   interface. This approach provides mechanisms to guide users through
   paths of study followed by students with similar profiles, without
   violating the human-computer interaction principle of perceived
   stability. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of the study is to build a model that predicts the level of
   Internet use by teachers of English as a foreign language in the
   northern Taiwanese higher education institutions. It examines
   interactional relationships among variables associated with barriers
   and issues of technology application as a means of analyzing the extent
   and the nature of Internet-integration instruction. A multivariate
   hypothesized model was tested using structural equation modeling to
   analyze statistically the variables examined in the study. The
   resulting model is found to have a good statistical fit. Teacher
   training, classroom pedagogy, and perceived capability have direct
   effect on Internet use, whereas institutional support, constructivist
   thinking, beliefs, and attitudes affect Internet use indirectly. These
   seven variables account for approximately 58.6% of the variance of
   Internet use. Teacher training appears to be the most dominant
   determinant of Internet use. More opportunities for professional
   development focused on technology applications in language instruction
   are crucial. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MENTAL MODELS
AB While different approaches to evaluation will yield different results,
   depending on the purpose of the evaluation this article describes an
   evaluation approach that was aimed at investigation the mental models
   of users of the programme. The study was driven by questions about the
   differences in mental models of the instructional designers and the
   learners, the time learners spent working through the program and the
   observable changes in their mental models. In this design experiment, a
   program was developed to teach basic principles of electricity. Three
   boys and three girls one each of high, medium and low achievement in
   science were selected from an advantaged urban school, and a similar
   sample was taken from a disadvantaged rural school. They were asked to
   draw their impressions of various concepts of electricity and then
   allowed free access to the program, where they could visit any section
   even if they had not completed a previous one. Afterwards they were
   asked to draw sketches again. Other instruments included an opinion
   questionnaire and observation of the learners working with a "think
   aloud" protocol. It was found that there were considerable differences
   in the mental models of the learners and designers about what to expect
   from computer-based learning. While navigational freedom allowed fast
   learners to move through work that they knew already, weaker learners
   tended to get lost. The sketches that learners made before and after
   exposure to the program provided valuable insights into the growth of
   their understanding of the concepts. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB By comparing two-dimensional (2D) chemical animations designed for
   computer's desktop with three-dimensional (3D) chemical animations
   designed for the full immersive virtual reality environment CAVE(TM) we
   studied how virtual reality environments could raise student's interest
   and motivation for learning. By using the 3ds max(TM), we can visualize
   the chemical phenomena easily and quickly without knowing any special
   computer language and export the application to files which are
   compatible with the CAVE(TM) (Object or OpenGL files). After the
   participation in 3D animations at the CAVE(TM) students comprehended
   the molecules' structure and their changes during a chemical reaction
   better than during the 2D animations on the computer's desktop, as the
   limitations of human vision had been overcome. Furthermore, the
   students were enthusiastic, as they had the feeling that they were
   inside the chemical reactions and they were facing the 3D molecules as
   if they were real objects front of them. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB This study investigated Greek high school students' intentions and
   motivation towards and against pursuing academic studies in Computer
   Science (CS), the influence of the family and the scholastic
   environment on students' career choices, students' perceptions of CS
   and the Information Technology (IT) profession as well as students'
   attendance at CS courses at school, computer use in the home and
   self-efficacy beliefs regarding computers. Gender differences were
   examined with a view to identifying factors that may affect boys' and
   girls' career choices. The participants were 358 students of both sexes
   who completed an anonymous questionnaire. The data analysis showed that
   girls are less likely than boys to pursue a CS degree, and when they do
   so, it is mainly because of extrinsic reasons rather than personal
   interest in CS. Lack of opportunities for early familiarization with
   computing in the home and the scholastic environment is the factor that
   mainly differentiates boys' and girls' motivation against studying CS,
   having a greater impact on girls. Misconceptions of CS were detected in
   students of both genders. Girls view CS as a self-referencing, machine-
   and programming-oriented discipline to a greater extent than boys do,
   and hold less positive views of the IT profession. Boys view CS as more
   human- and application-oriented than girls do. They also have greater
   computer self-efficacy and more sex-stereotypical views of CS and IT as
   male domains. Appropriate actions to increase girls' interest and
   participation in CS studies are proposed according to the findings. (C)

AB This paper describes an exploratory study of 225 management students in
   a medium-sized university in southern Spain. The influences of gender
   and previous experience as determinants of technology use were
   analysed. Furthermore, a modified Technology Acceptance Model, using
   SEM, was applied to explain the influence of perceived computer
   self-efficacy on the intention to use Internet-based e-collaboration
   technologies in the learning-teaching process. This was completed with
   qualitative data from unstructured interviews with ten students. Our
   results suggest that the management student cannot be considered an
   advanced user of the Internet. Computer self-efficacy has a positive
   influence on intention to use the system. This intention is also
   influenced by attitude towards the system, but not directly by
   perceived usefulness. These and other contradictory findings are
   analysed in the paper. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB Since learning English is very popular in non-English speaking
   countries, developing modern assisted-learning tools that support
   effective English learning is a critical issue in the English-language
   education field. Learning English involves memorization and practice of
   a large number of vocabulary words and numerous grammatical structures.
   Vocabulary learning is a principal issue for English learning because
   vocabulary comprises the basic building blocks of English sentences.
   Therefore, many studies have attempted to improve the efficiency and
   performance when learning English vocabulary. With the accelerated
   growth in wireless and mobile technologies, mobile learning using
   mobile devices such as PDAs, tablet PCs, and cell phones has gradually
   become considered effective because it inherits all the advantages of
   e-learning and overcomes limitations of learning time and space that
   limit web-based learning systems. Therefore, this study presents a
   personalized mobile English vocabulary learning system based on Item
   Response Theory and learning memory cycle, which recommends appropriate
   English vocabulary for learning according to individual learner
   vocabulary ability and memory cycle. The proposed system has been
   successfully implemented on personal digital assistant (PDA) for
   personalized English vocabulary learning. The experimental results
   indicated that the proposed system could obviously promote the learning
   performances and interests of learners due to effective and flexible
   learning mode for English vocabulary learning. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The purpose of this study was to integrate technology and team-teaching
   techniques into science teacher education method courses in order to
   explore the effects of such integration on preservice teachers. The
   participants included one instructor and a total of 42 preservice
   teachers. A technology team-teaching model (TTT) was designed in this
   study to restructure science method courses with technology. This study
   used a mixed-method design, incorporating both quantitative and
   qualitative techniques. The results revealed that there were
   significant differences in "designing an appropriate science topic to
   be taught with technology" and "integrating computer activities with
   appropriate pedagogy in classroom instruction" (F = 5.260, p < 0.05,
   and F = 10.260, p < 0.01, respectively). The results also showed that
   the TTT model could enhance the integration of science teaching
   theories and practice. Team-teaching technique facilitated the
   integration of technology in science lesson design and teaching
   practice, and enhanced friendship through interaction. The TTT model
   could better the science learning experience of preservice teachers and
   serve as useful reference for other teacher education institutes. (C)

AB This study deals with the instructional efficiency of integrating text
   and animation into computer-based science instruction. The participants
   were 84 seventh-grade students in a private primary school in Istanbul.
   The efficiency of instruction was measured by mental effort and
   performance level of the learners. The results of the study showed that
   processing integrated text and animation format in computer-based
   science instruction requires less mental effort than the separated
   format, and that the performance of the students in the group with
   integrated presentation format group is higher than that of students in
   the group with separated presentation format. Instructional efficiency
   of the integrated presentation group was found to be higher than that
   of the separated presentation group. Finally, there was no difference
   between the two groups for instructional time. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The study evaluated the current situation in Cyprus elementary
   classrooms regarding computer technology integration in an attempt to
   identify ways of expanding teachers' and students' experiences with
   computer technology. It examined how Cypriot elementary teachers use
   computers, and the factors that influence computer integration in their
   classroom practices. To address the study's research questions, an
   evaluative case study design was applied. It employed a mixed method
   approach through the usage of structured questionnaires and
   semi-structured, open-ended interviews as the major methods of data
   collection. Quantitative and qualitative data gathered from a sample of
   Cypriot teachers who where identified as high and low computer use ones.
   The results of the study revealed that computers are not extensively
   used in classrooms. When they are used in classrooms, it tends to be in
   a rather sporadic fashion, more as supporting tools or fancy
   chalkboards than as educational tools. Few teachers were found to use
   computers in any sort of progressive way. Three categories of factors
   (personal, professional and organizational) that influence teachers in
   applying computers in their classroom practices were identified. They
   sited light in explaining the level and kind of computer integration in
   Cyprus elementary schools. The outcomes confirm the findings of other
   studies conducted in different educational settings regarding computer
   usage as well as the factors that influence computer integration.
   Consequently, the study suggest ways of expanding teachers' and
   students' experiences with computer technology, poses questions for
   further research regarding the potential approaches to computer
   technology integration and the philosophy that underlies computer
   integration in schools. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The unprecedented growth in numbers of children playing computer games
   has stimulated discussion and research regarding what, if any,
   educational value these games have for teaching and learning. The
   research on this topic has primarily focused on children as players of
   computer games rather than builders/constructors of computer games.
   Recently, several game companies, such as BioWare Corp. and Bethesda
   Softworks, have released game story creation tools to the public, along
   with their games. However, a major obstacle to using these commercial
   tools is the level of programming experience required to create
   interactive game stories. In this paper, we demonstrate that a
   commercial game story construction tool, BioWare Corp.'s Aurora
   Toolset, can be augmented by our new tool, ScriptEase, to enable
   students in two grade ten English classes to successfully construct
   interactive game stories. We present evidence that describes the
   relationship between interactive story authoring and traditional story
   authoring, along with a series of factors that can potentially affect
   success at these activities: gender, creativity, intellectual ability,
   previous experiences with programming, time playing computer games, and
   time spent online. Results indicate that students can successfully
   construct sophisticated interactive stories with very little training.
   The results also show no gender differences in the quality of these
   interactive stories, regardless of programming experience or the amount
   of time per week playing computer games or participating in general
   online activities, although a subset of female students did show a
   slightly higher level of performance on interactive story authoring. In
   the educational context of this study, we show that ScriptEase provides
   an easy-to-use tool for interactive story authoring in a
   constructionist learning environment. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This paper presents the design, features and pilot evaluation study of
   a web-based environment -the SORTING environment- for the learning of
   sorting algorithms by secondary level education students. The design of
   this environment is based on modeling methodology, taking into account
   modern constructivist and social theories of learning while at the same
   time acknowledging the role of hands-on experience, the significance of
   students' expressing their previous knowledge, the importance of
   interlinked multiple representation systems (MRS) and the role of
   constructive feedback on student learning. Although SORTING supports
   student learning of typical sorting algorithms such as Bubble-sort,
   Quick-sort and Selection-sort, it can also be adapted to integrate more
   sorting algorithms. The analysis of the data emerging from the pilot
   evaluation study of SORTING has shown that students used all the
   representation systems (RS) provided and found them attractive and easy
   to use. On the whole, student interactions within SORTING helped them
   to become aware of both the intuitive and the typical sorting
   procedures used, to conceptualize them, to overcome learning
   difficulties, to correct themselves and to make connections between
   different representations of the sorting algorithms used. (C) 2007

AB This study reports an adaptive digital learning project, scientific

   based on the theories of Dual Situated Learning Model (DSLM) and
   scientific reasoning. In addition, the authors investigated the effects
   of an SCCR related to a "combustion" topic for sixth grade students
   conceptual change and scientific reasoning. An experimental research
   design including the Combustion Achievement Test (CAT), Scientific
   Reasoning Test (SRT) and Combustion Dependent Reasoning Test (CDRT) was
   applied for both experimental and conventional group students before,
   directly after, and after the sixth week of the research as pre-, post-
   and retention-test. Results indicated that the experimental group
   students significantly outperformed the conventional group students on
   both post- and retention- of CAT and CDRT scores. In addition,
   experimental group students performed better than conventional group
   students on the post-SRT scores. The success rate of conceptual change
   ranged from 70% to 100% for experimental group students for most
   web-based dual situated learning events. The nature of the scientific
   reasoning used by experimental group students mainly either made
   progression (PG) or maintain-correct (MTC) across most events from
   before to after web-based dual situated learning events. All of these
   results support the claim that students' conceptual change their
   scientific reasoning ability can be promoted through an SCCR digital

AB Computer-based testing - is an effective teacher's tool, intended to
   optimize course goals and assessment techniques in a comparatively
   short time. However, this is accomplished only if we deal with
   high-quality tests. It is strange, but despite the 100-year history of
   Testing Theory (see, Anastasi, A., Urbina, S. (1997). Psychological
   testing. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall) there still exist some
   misconceptions. Modern wide-spread systems for computer based course
   management and testing reveal a set of problems corresponding to
   certain features of testing methods.
   This article is devoted to some omissions typical to several course
   management systems (e.g., Moodle and Blackboard). These omissions and
   the ways of avoiding them are shown in a simple test intended to verify
   student knowledge. We suggest a special test description language
   dedicated to drawing your attention to the mathematical aspects of test
   quality. The language can also be realized in computer software. We
   provide an example of such software in this article. (C) 2007 Elsevier

AB Previous research of adaptive learning mainly focused on improving
   student learning achievements based only on single-source of
   personalization information, such as learning style, cognitive style or
   learning achievement. In this paper, an innovative adaptive learning
   approach is proposed by basing upon two main sources of personalization
   information, that is, learning behavior and personal learning style. To
   determine the initial learning styles of the students, the [Keefe, J.
   W. (1987). Learning Styles: Theory and Practice. Reston, VA: National
   Association of Secondary School Principals.] questionnaire is employed
   in our approach. To more precisely reflect the learning behaviors of
   each student, the interactions and learning results of each student are
   analyzed when adjusting the subject materials. Based on the innovative
   approach, an adaptive learning system has been developed; moreover, an
   experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance of our approach.
   By analyzing the results from three groups of students using different
   adaptive learning approaches, it can be found that the innovative
   approach is helpful in improving both the learning achievement and
   learning efficiency of individual students. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

ID ITEM RESPONSE THEORY
AB Personalized curriculum sequencing is an important research issue for
   web-based learning systems because no fixed learning paths will be
   appropriate for all learners. Therefore, many researchers focused on
   developing e-learning systems with personalized learning mechanisms to
   assist on-line web-based learning and adaptively provide learning paths
   in order to promote the learning performance of individual learners.
   However, most personalized e-learning systems usually neglect to
   consider if learner ability and the difficulty level of the recommended
   courseware are matched to each other while performing personalized
   learning services. Moreover, the problem of concept continuity of
   learning paths also needs to be considered while implementing
   personalized curriculum sequencing because smooth learning paths
   enhance the linked strength between learning concepts. Generally,
   inappropriate courseware leads to learner cognitive overload or
   disorientation during learning processes, thus reducing learning
   performance. Therefore, compared to the freely browsing learning mode
   without any personalized learning path guidance used in most web-based
   learning systems, this paper assesses whether the proposed
   genetic-based personalized e-learning system, which can generate
   appropriate learning paths according to the incorrect testing responses
   of an individual learner in a pre-test, provides benefits in terms of
   learning performance promotion while learning. Based on the results of
   pre-test, the proposed genetic-based personalized e-learning system can
   conduct personalized curriculum sequencing through simultaneously
   considering courseware difficulty level and the concept continuity of
   learning paths to support web-based learning. Experimental results
   indicated that applying the proposed genetic-based personalized
   e-learning system for web-based learning is superior to the freely
   browsing learning mode because of high quality and concise learning
   path for individual learners. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The explosive growth of the Internet has made the knowledge and skills
   for creating Web pages into general subjects that all students should
   learn. It is now common to teach the technical side of the production
   of Web pages and many teaching materials have been developed. However
   teaching the aesthetic side of Web page design has been neglected, and
   students not in art or design majors are normally confronted with
   difficulties when they do expressive design of Web pages.
   This paper proposes a learning process using worksheets called the
   Image-Plot and the Standard Design Table. These were developed as
   teaching materials for courses on the production of Web pages in
   universities and colleges. The learning process focuses especially on
   how to enhance the visual expression of Web pages. Using these
   worksheets for courses on the production of Web page raised students'
   consciousness of Web pages visual expression. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

ID SELF-PACED INSTRUCTION; PROCRASTINATION
AB Archived data from four courses taught with computer-aided personalized
   system of instruction (CAPSI) - an online, self-paced, instructional
   program - were used to explore the relationship between objectively
   rescored final exam grades, peer reviewing, and progress rate - i.e.,
   the rate at which students completed unit tests. There was a strong
   positive correlation (r = .68, p < .01) between rate of progress and
   the amount of peer reviewing students did. This was predictable because
   peer reviewers had to be further along in the course than the students
   whose unit tests they reviewed. Students who completed all the units
   tended to obtain higher final exam scores than those who did not. For
   students who completed all the units there was little difference
   between the final exam performance of those who had a high progress
   rate and those who had a low progress rate. Considering all students
   together there was a moderate correlation between progress rate and
   final exam performance (r = .36, p < .01). In addition, there was a
   moderate positive correlation (r = .33, p < .01) between the amount of
   peer reviewing students did and their performance on the final exam.
   This correlation was substantially reduced (r = .13, p < .20) when rate
   of progress was partialed out. Thus, overall, students who progressed
   more rapidly through the course did more peer reviewing and learned
   more as measured by final exam performance. Interestingly, there were
   students who showed good learning without much participation in course
   related behaviors such as completing unit tests and peer reviewing. It
   is concluded that the CAPSI instructional program provides a good
   learning environment for students who utilize its components but it
   also accommodates other learning styles. In addition, there may be a
   distinction between students who complete all assigned units and those
   who do not regardless of their tendencies to procrastinate. (C) 2007

AB Describing digital technologies as tool, tutor, environment or resource
   in pedagogical contexts is common, and this paper examines the
   metaphorical nature of these descriptions and their implications for
   digitally-based teaching and learning practices. To compare the
   metaphors, the paper first develops a model of pedagogy derived from
   Activity Theory. It explores the implications of these metaphors in
   practical situations by examining a set of 60 digitally-based
   activities, collected as part of a snapshot survey of a representative
   sample of maintained schools in England, to draw out their pedagogical
   characteristics. In conclusion the paper discusses the issues raised by
   the analysis for the relationship between use of digital technologies
   and learners' attainments, and the efficacy of the model that has been
   developed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the study is to develop a web-based mathematics teaching
   (WBMT) material and to evaluate the effectiveness of the WBMT material
   for 9th grade students learning the concept of mathematical function.
   Firstly, a WBMT material was designed and piloted. As a result of this
   pilot study the site was revised as a final form. The study was
   conducted during the fall term of 2004-2005 academic years and was
   carried out in two different classes taught by the same teacher.
   Through mixed methods study the qualitative and quantitative data were
   collected from the sample, consisting of eighteen teachers and eighty
   9th grade students. One of these teachers taught the control and
   experimental groups at the high school where the main study was
   conducted. This examination included comparing the results of students
   experiencing learning with WBMT with those do not, and interpreting the
   teachers' responses to the use of WBMT materials. The analysis of the
   data suggests positive effect of WBMT on student learning of
   mathematical function and on attitudes towards WBMT. However, the
   teachers all represented and shared some common ideas that because of
   the technical problems and readiness of teachers and students there
   would be some problems in terms of successful implementation of WBMT in
   schools. Nevertheless, the results provide support for the use of this
   WBMT material as a complement to traditional classes. (C) 2007 Elsevier

AB Although the benefits of e-learning have been discussed in various
   previous studies; it is a critical issue of better understanding the
   reasons why some learners are dissatisfied with the e-learning
   experience. Therefore, this research investigates learners'
   satisfaction, behavioral intentions, and the effectiveness of the
   Blackboard c-learning system. A total of 424 university students were
   surveyed using a standard questionnaire. The results showed that
   perceived self-efficacy is a critical factor that influences learners'
   satisfaction with the Blackboard e-learning system. Perceived
   usefulness and perceived satisfaction both contribute to the learners'
   behavioral intention to use the e-learning system. Furthermore,
   e-learning effectiveness can be influenced by multimedia instruction,
   interactive learning activities, and e-learning system quality. This
   research proposes a conceptual model for understanding learners'
   satisfaction, behavioral intention, and effectiveness of using the
   e-learning system. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the results of an investigation into the various
   ways in which pre-service and in-service teachers experience learning
   to program in an object-oriented language. Both groups of teachers were
   enrolled in university courses. In most cases, the pre-service teachers
   were learning to program for the first time, while the in-service
   teachers had previously programmed using a procedural programming
   language. Phenomenography was used to identify categories of
   description of learning to program. From these categories an outcome
   space was created that shows the relationship between different
   experiences of learning to program. The outcome space can be
   represented as circles inscribed within one another, where the
   innermost circle represents a lower level of cognitive accomplishment
   and the outer circles subsume the inner circles. The five levels of the
   outcome space are: meeting the requirements, learning the
   syntax/learning by comparison, understanding and assimilating, problem
   solving and programming in the large. Implications of the findings for
   teaching are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two cycles of design-based research of a cognitive tool (CT) for
   teaching fractions have been completed. Following the success of a
   quasi-experimental study of the enhanced CT derived from the second
   cycle of design-based research, this article reports the findings of a
   pre-test-post-test control group empirical study using the enhanced CT
   in the classroom. The results indicate that there were no statistically
   significant differences in learning outcomes between the exploratory
   learning approach, using the CT, and the traditional direct teaching
   approach. The CT enabled students to generate a procedural knowledge of
   adding and subtracting fractions with like and unlike denominators
   through an exploratory learning process. Teachers asserted that the CT
   was effective for stimulating reciprocal tutoring among students, and
   students were enthusiastic about using the CT as an educational tool.
   Hence, the CT has potential for further development as a tool for
   promoting collaborative learning in the classroom. (c) 2007 Elsevier

AB This paper reports a study assessing a new computer tool for cartoon
   storytelling, created by the authors for a target audience in the upper
   half of the English and Welsh Key Stage 2 (years 5 and 6, covering ages
   9-11 years). The tool attempts to provide users with more opportunities
   for expressive visualisation than previous educational software; its
   design was motivated by earlier work connecting "moving image literacy"
   with print literacy, and it was used here in storywriting preparation
   work: users first visualised a known story, then wrote their versions
   of it based on the cartoons they had made. The stories produced are
   compared with stories written using two other preparation activities,
   one a pencil-and- paper cartooning exercise and the other a teacher's
   normal planning session, which also resulted in a retelling of a known
   story.
   The study finds that no one preparation process had a noticeably
   different effect on the final written stories; however, the cartoons
   produced with the software are found to be quite different to their
   paper counterparts, showing a greater variety of character action, pose
   and interaction, slightly more variety of camera shot distance, and
   more pictures. Children's and teachers' reactions to the software tool
   are also discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although previous research has demonstrated the benefits of applying
   the Internet facilities to the learning process, problems with this
   strategy have also been identified. One of the major difficulties is
   owing to the lack of an online learning environment that can record the
   learning portfolio of using the Internet facilities in education, such
   that the teacher can analyze and evaluate the learning performance of
   students, and hence the teaching strategies can be adjusted
   accordingly. In this paper, we propose a web-search learning
   environment, called Meta-Analyzer, which is able to assist the teachers
   in analyzing student learning behaviors of using search engines for
   problem solving. Two-hundred and twenty students and 54 teachers
   contributed to the trial of the system. The results have shown that the
   novel approach is able to gain a better understanding about students'
   learning processes and searching strategies in technology-enhanced
   environments, as well as to assist the teachers to acquire more about
   the learning status of students, and hence more constructive
   suggestions can be given accordingly. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This study investigates the hypothesis that students' learning and
   problem-solving performance in ill-structured domains can be improved,
   if elaborative question prompts are used to activate students'
   context-generating cognitive processes, during case study. Two groups
   of students used a web-based learning environment to criss-cross and
   study case-based material in the software project management domain.
   The experimental group was additionally prompted to consistently answer
   a set of questions based on a model of context-generating processes,
   meant to engage students in deeper processing of information presented
   in cases. Students were also classified as having either "complex" or
   "simple" EB profile (based on their epistemological beliefs record),
   thereby establishing a 2 x 2 factorial design. Results indicated that
   scaffolding treatment had a significant main effect on students'
   performance, with the experimental group performing better in both
   domain knowledge acquisition and knowledge transfer post-test items.
   There is also tentative indication that EB profile and scaffolding
   treatment interact, with complex-EB learners benefiting most from the
   scaffolded condition. Overall, the study provides evidence that it is
   possible to improve individual learning in a technology environment for
   case-based learning, by implementing appropriate questioning strategies
   that trigger students to activate their context-generating cognitive
   processes, while studying the contextually rich material of cases. (c)

   articles were identified as being related to the topic of cognition in
   e-learning. These articles were cross analyzed by published years,
   journal, research topic, and citation count. Furthermore, 16
   highly-cited articles across different topics were chosen for further
   analysis according to their research settings, participants, research
   design types, and research methods. It was found from the analysis of
   the 444 articles that "Instructional Approaches," "Learning
   Environment," and "Metacognition" were the three most popular research
   topics, but the analysis of the citation counts suggested that the
   studies related to "Instructional Approaches," "Information Processing"
   and "Motivation" might have a greater impact on subsequent research.
   Although the use of questionnaires might still be the main method of
   gathering research data in e-learning cognitive studies, a clear trend
   was observed that more and more studies were utilizing learners' log
   files or online messages as data sources for analysis. The results of
   the analysis provided insights for educators and researchers into
   research trends and patterns of cognition in e-learning. (c) 2007

AB Identity formation is a critical dimension of how and why students
   engage in science to varying degrees. In this paper, we use the lens of
   identity fort-nation, and in particular identities in practice, to make
   sense of how and why Melanie, over the course of sixth grade,
   transformed from a marginalized member of the science class with a
   failing grade to a highly valued member of the sixth-grade science
   community with a perfect score of a 100% for the sixth-grade exit
   project. Our findings reveal that the different figured worlds of the
   science classroom, such as whole class, small group work, and
   individual work, offered Melanie different affordances for identity
   formation that were built upon across such spaces, in both productive
   and unproductive ways. Our findings also take up the kinds of critical
   roles that members of her classroom community, in particular teacher
   and peers, play in supporting and constraining such a transformation.
   We discuss the implications identity formation has for understanding
   issues of gender equity and science learning.

TI The design, enactment, and experience of inquiry-based instruction in
   undergraduate science education: A case study
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CLASSROOM
AB The purpose of this study was to understand one case of undergraduate
   inquiry-based instruction through the words and actions of students and
   instructors. The data sources included fieldnotes from 16 of 29
   classes, two sets of student and instructor interviews (beginning and
   end of the semester), and a collection of artifacts, such as the
   laboratory manual, lecture handouts, and the course syllabus. The
   participants for this study included four faculty instructors and two
   purposively selected student groups, totaling eight students. We found
   the instructors' two course goals, (a) teaching students how scientists
   do science and (b) using an interdisciplinary approach to develop
   students' content knowledge of the big ideas in science, were
   consistent with our observations and the students' descriptions of
   their experience in the course. However, we observed, and the students
   also noted, an important feature of the course that the instructors did
   not describe as a course goal was its reliance on the social nature of
   learning. This telling case demonstrates that inquiry-based instruction
   is achievable in undergraduate science education. Implications are
   discussed for college science instructors interested in inquiry
   teaching.

ID SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY; STUDENTS; KNOWLEDGE; EPISTEMOLOGIES
AB This research reports on a study of curriculum materials development
   and use compared with the use of existing curriculum materials in an
   elementary classroom. The research explored the effect of explicit
   attention to epistemic practices in curriculum materials and the
   enactment of those materials. Epistemic practices include asking
   questions, collecting data, making descriptions of observations,
   finding patterns in the data, and developing scientific reasoning.
   Scaffolding considered the function, role, and purpose of epistemic
   practices in the community of science and the production of scientific
   knowledge. The designed curriculum was compared with an existing
   pedagogically similar curriculum to consider whether the scaffolding
   and explicitness affected enactment. Findings lead to the conclusion
   that enactment was impacted. Specifically, findings show that
   scaffolding in materials created more instances of students engaging in
   scientific reasoning. Similarly, the explicit description of epistemic
   practices supported the teacher in explicitly providing opportunities
   for children to learn about and use epistemic practices of science.
   Finally, when using the designed curriculum, teacher modifications
   during enactment showed to be more consistent with the intended
   instructional approach and also helpful for children in learning
   epistemic practices of science.

ID SCIENCE
AB This paper reports the synthesis of three case studies of students'
   engagement in inquiry-based learning activities in an upper-level
   undergraduate geology course. Details of how students engaged in
   scientific questions, gave priority to evidence, formulated
   explanations, evaluated explanations, and communicated and justified
   their findings are presented. Data for this study included classroom
   observations and fieldnotes of classroom practices, questionnaires,
   archival data (e.g., student work samples), and audiotapes and
   transcripts of interviews conducted with the student participants
   throughout the course. The findings suggest that although these
   students were able to successfully appropriate inquiry practices (e.g.,
   giving priority to evidence), it was not without its challenges (e.g.,
   perceived lack of guidance). A detailed discussion of the ways in which
   students were successful, and where they had challenges engaging in
   inquiry is presented, with the goal of helping direct practitioners and
   researchers to strategies whereby students' inquiry experiences can be
   improved.

TI PISA test items and school textbooks related to science: A textual
   comparison
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID EDUCATION; LANGUAGE; PRESS
AB The paper compares the nature of the textual construction of the
   Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) science test
   items and the Greek school science textbooks. This nature is determined
   by the interplay of the notions of classification (content
   specialization) and formality (code specialization) modulated by both
   the linguistic and the visual expressive modes. The results of the
   relevant analysis showed that the textual materials employed in PISA
   and in school textbooks are oppositional in nature. Specifically, while
   the linguistic mode of the PISA items tends to resemble texts falling
   within the public domain (nonspecialized content and code), the
   corresponding visual mode tends to resemble texts of the esoteric
   domain (specialized content and code) thus familiarizing students with
   the specialized conventions and ways of representing entities falling
   within the realm of technoscientific knowledge. On the other hand,
   school science textbooks tend to employ the linguistic and the visual
   mode in exactly the opposite way. These differences between PISA
   science items and school science textbooks could contribute to a
   disorientation of the students in relation to what is expected in each
   specific context. This disparity could potentially be one of the
   factors explaining the low level of Greek Students' attainment in PISA.

TI Examining the cognitive processes used by adolescent girls and women
   scientists in identifying science role models: A feminist approach
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION

   ATTITUDES; EDUCATION
AB Women remain underrepresented in science professions. Studies have
   shown that students are more likely to select careers when they can
   identify a role model in that career path. Further research has shown
   that the success of this strategy is enhanced by the use of
   gender-matched role models. While prior work provides insights into the
   value of using role models, it does not explain the cognitive process
   involved in girls identifying role models from nontraditional careers
   for women. This feminist study addresses this gap by examining the
   cognitive process eighth-grade girls use in identifying a person as a
   science role model and comparing it to the process used by women
   scientists seeking to serve as possible science role models. Data
   revealed that the girls' process in identifying a role model involved
   personal connections and their initial image of a scientist led them to
   believe they could not have such a connection with a scientist. The
   initial views expressed by the women suggested they felt pressure to
   portray "perfect" scientists in order to be a role model. A common
   understanding of a science role model was realized only after changes
   occurred in the girls' image of scientists and the scientists' image of
   a role model. The catalysts for these changes were the relationships
   that developed between girls and women scientists.

ID DISCURSIVE IDENTITY; SCIENTIFIC LITERACY; STUDENTS
AB This research project explores the language practices that emerged as a
   teacher taught a lesson designed to promote science literacy
   development for traditionally underrepresented students. This
   ethnographic study of a Detroit, Michigan, school examined the
   teacher's use of science language and its influence on students' use of
   science language. Using sociolinguistic discourse analysis, two modes
   of classroom language were identified. First, the teacher used a hybrid
   method of language involving her explaining science ideas by using
   vernacular and scientific language. This parenthetical type of speech,
   which we describe as "double talk," was also found in students. Second,
   students appropriated this same strategy for using science language in
   which they produced vernacular and scientific descriptions during
   explanations. The findings of this study are significant in their
   contribution to contemporary research about teaching and learning for
   minority students. These results implicate the need to teach science
   explicitly as a second language in urban classrooms.

AB This study examined urban elementary teachers' knowledge and practices
   in teaching science while supporting English language development of
   English language learning (ELL) students. As part of a larger 5-year
   research project in the United States, the study involved 38
   third-grade teachers who participated in the first-year implementation
   of a professional development intervention that consisted of curriculum
   units and teacher workshops. The study examined four areas-teacher
   knowledge of science content, teaching science for understanding,
   teaching science for inquiry, and teacher support for English language
   development-through a questionnaire, classroom observations, and
   postobservation interviews. Results indicate that teachers' knowledge
   and practices were generally within the bounds supported by the
   intervention; however, such knowledge and practices fell short of the
   goal of reform-oriented practices. The results provide insights for our
   ongoing intervention and other similar efforts and contribute to the
   emerging knowledge base on science and English language and literacy
   with ELL students.

AB In this study, we examined the effectiveness of instructional materials
   designed to control redundancy and split attention in the teaching of
   complex orthopedic physical therapy skills. Participants included 41
   first-year physical therapy students. The modified instruction group
   received a modified unit of instruction designed to reduce cognitive
   load, while the control group received a traditionally designed unit of
   instruction. Four hypotheses were tested relating to achievement on
   cognitive and psychomotor tests, ratings of cognitive load, and task
   completion times. The multivariate analysis yielded significant results
   for three of the four hypotheses (ES = +0.52). As predicted, the
   participants receiving the modified instructional materials scored
   significantly higher on the written post-test and psychomotor tasks,
   while reporting a lower level of cognitive load on both tasks. These
   results suggest that designers can increase the germane cognitive load
   by reducing the extraneous cognitive load through good instructional
   and message design practices.

AB Problem-based learning (PBL) is an instructional approach in which
   students in small groups engage in an authentic, ill-structured
   problem, and must (1) define, generate and pursue learning issues to
   understand the problem, (2) develop a possible solution, (3) provide
   evidence to support their solution, and (4) present their solution and
   the evidence that supports it (Barrows, How to design a problem-based
   curriculum for the preclinical years. Springer Publishing, New York,
   1985). However, research has shown that novice problem-solvers and
   learners without deep content knowledge have difficulty developing
   strong evidence-based arguments (Krajcik et al., J Learn Sci 7:313-350,
   1998a; Reiser, J Lear Sci 13(3):273-304, 2004). In this paper, we
   discuss the components of (e.g., claims and evidence) and processes of
   making (e.g., define problem and make claim) evidence-based arguments.
   Furthermore, we review various scaffolding models designed to help
   students perform various tasks associated with creating evidence-based
   arguments (e.g., link claims to evidence) and present guidelines for
   the development of computer-based scaffolds to help middle school
   students build evidence-based arguments.

AB This research assessed the value of case study methodology in the
   design of an educational computer simulation. Three sources of
   knowledge were compared to assess the value of case study: practitioner
   and programmer knowledge, disciplinary knowledge, and knowledge
   obtained from a case study of teacher practice. A retrospective
   analysis revealed that the case study was the source of 16 out of 23
   design decisions and therefore was the most significant influence on
   the design of the simulation. The case study was particularly effective
   in sensitizing the design team to the classroom context, identifying
   common and uncommon teacher practices, revealing unexpected dimensions
   of interactions in the classroom, and generating constructive changes
   to the design of the simulation. Case studies can significantly enrich
   the design of educational software and are a promising methodological
   choice for design teams.

AB Students learned about teaching principles with a multimedia program
   that either did not include a classroom exemplar illustrating how to
   apply the learned principles to the teaching practice (control group)
   or included a classroom exemplar in video, animation, or text format.
   Across two experiments, video and animation groups reported more
   favorable attitudes towards learning and were better able to apply the
   learned principles than the control group. Text and control groups did
   not differ in their learning or attitudes towards learning, suggesting
   that format is an important factor in determining the effectiveness of
   classroom exemplars as pedagogical tools for teacher education. Results
   encourage the use of visual classroom exemplars to promote the
   application of theory into practice.

AB Sound may hold great promise for instructional software by supporting
   learning in a variety of ways. Conceptual and preconceptual barriers,
   however, still appear to prevent software designers from using sound
   more effectively in their instructional products. Interface books
   seldom discuss the use of sound and when they do, it is most often
   simple verbatim narration of on-screen text. This content analysis of
   12 award-winning instructional software products indicated that, while
   sound is being incorporated into many learning environments, many
   instructional designers are using sound only for literal, information
   conveyance and not yet exploring how to exploit the associative
   potential of music, sound effects, and narration to help learners
   process the material under study more deeply.

AB Although research emphasizes the importance of integrating technology
   into the curriculum, the use of technology can only be effective if
   teachers themselves possess the expertise to use technology in a
   meaningful way in the classroom. The aim of this study was to assist
   Egyptian teachers in developing teaching and learning through the
   application of a particular digital technology. Students were
   encouraged to work through the process of producing their own digital
   stories using MS Photo Story, while being introduced to desktop
   production and editing tools. They also presented, published and shared
   their own stories with other students in the class. Quantitative and
   qualitative instruments, including digital story evaluation rubric,
   integration of technology observation instruments and interviews for
   evaluating the effectiveness of digital storytelling into learning were
   implemented to examine the extent to which students were engaged in
   authentic learning tasks using digital storytelling. The findings from
   the analysis of students-produced stories revealed that overall,
   students did well in their projects and their stories met many of the
   pedagogical and technical attributes of digital stories. The findings
   from classroom observations and interviews revealed that despite
   problems observed and reported by teachers, they believed that the
   digital storytelling projects could increase students' understanding of
   curricular content and they were willing to transform their pedagogy
   and curriculum to include digital storytelling.

AB This study describes the development of a ubiquitous cooperative
   learning environment using proposed annotation services, wireless
   communication devices, and the Jigsaw method of cooperative learning.
   The purpose of the study is to investigate the potential benefits of
   studying digital course materials with embedded annotations. The SQ3R
   study method is introduced during the individual study phase of a
   series of Jigsaw learning activities, enabling students to access and
   familiarize themselves with course content. In this phase, learners use
   the SQ3R method to enhance the quality of their annotations. It is
   noted that during this phase, individual students worked in separate
   locations. After the individual study phase, an expert group meeting
   process refines the annotations made by student experts and then the
   annotations discussed are provided to all members of the Jigsaw group
   during the group meeting phase. Importantly, annotations from different
   levels of literal meaning and connotation are assigned to different
   learners to help the group members develop a greater sense of context
   awareness of the different aspects of the topics under study. Analysis
   of data collected from questionnaires given to participants at the end
   of the study indicates that the proposed annotation services using
   handheld devices can enhance students' learning potential. The results
   also indicate the suitability and practicality of annotation services
   in an ubiquitous Jigsaw cooperative learning environment.

AB A number of studies have evidenced that handheld devices are
   appropriate tools to facilitate face-to-face collaborative learning
   effectively because of the possibility of ample social interactions.
   Group Area Network, or GroupNet, proposed in this paper, uses handheld
   devices to fill the gap between Local Area Network and Body Area
   Network. GroupNet is an independent network where all members are
   located at the same place and all handheld devices involved in it are
   interconnected by peer-to-peer wireless technologies. The GroupNet
   concept proposed in our study is more focus on how to design a mobile
   learning management system which can better support mobile learning for
   a small group of learners with effective social interaction within
   proximity. This paper describes the architecture of GroupNet and
   demonstrates its functionality in the specific area of mobile learning.
   GroupNet uses handheld devices as the main hardware and GroupNet
   architecture consists of four layers. Various mobile learning scenarios
   are also described in detail to give guidance to instructors. These
   scenarios apply GroupNet to collaborative learning activities and
   situated learning activities. With rapid growth of mobile technology
   and global business context, many more possible scenarios of using
   GroupNet are expected to emerge in the future.

ID FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS
AB Recent advances in ubiquitous computing technologies have brought
   reality augmentation of traditional objects to context-aware and social
   supports. Although a significant proportion of students prefer poring
   over traditional paper textbooks over electronic books, few studies
   have enhanced reading practice of traditional books with ubiquitous
   context-aware and collaborative learning supports that provide timely,
   contextual assistance. This study proposed an innovative approach to
   develop a paper-based learning support environment in which mobile
   phones, traditional books and a Web-based discussion forum are
   integrated together to promote students' acquisition of knowledge.
   Students receive contextual messages from an online learning community
   based on their learning status. The timely recommendatory messages aim
   to facilitate collaboration among community members and offer guidance
   in students' study. The findings and results of an evaluation show that
   students' learning tasks and motivation were supported in the
   paper-based learning environment by community members. Students also
   generally had positive attitude to the context-aware recommendatory
   information delivered via mobile text messages. The ubiquity and
   immediacy of the recommendations may help students reach the right
   resources at the right time to improve their learning experience.

AB In this paper, we analyse how contextualised media can be used to
   support learning. Additionally, the advantages of contextualised
   learning and the types of learning that are fit to be supported are
   discussed. Our focus throughout the paper will be on lifelong learning,
   and the integration of formal and informal learning therein. However,
   we think, to this date, most of the research concerning contextualised
   and mobile learning has been focusing on technological issues.
   Therefore, as an attempt to shift the discussion to a more educational
   perspective, a generic technical framework is presented. The technical
   framework is based on a reference model that came about as the result
   of a literature analysis in a previous paper. The reference model
   should provide a foundation that leads to a flexible and generic
   technical framework that can be used in a range of different learning
   scenarios. Moreover, a generic technical approach should aim at an
   easier integration of contextualised learning appliances into current
   learning.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Computing devices and applications are now used beyond the desktop, in
   diverse environments, and this trend toward ubiquitous computing is
   evolving. In this study, we re-visit the interactivity concept and its
   applications for interactive function design in a ubiquitous-learning
   system (ULS). Further, we compare interactivity dimensions and
   corresponding interactive functions of web-based learning systems with
   ULS, and we offer a technical framework for a successful incorporation
   of interactive functions into ULS. To enhance the ease-of-use and the
   overall effectiveness of this framework, each of the four panels of
   experts assessed its own interactive-function term: learning needs,
   instructional necessity, mobile-interface design, or programming
   difficulty. Last, this study presents the best practices of a
   learner-centered ULS and discusses the panel experts' reviews of
   interactive functions in such a learning environment, along with
   suggestions for future research.

ID MUSEUM
AB Museums are one of the most important institutions providing students
   with the opportunity to gain knowledge, experience cultures, and
   develop different interests in an informal learning setting. As
   information and communication technology (ICT) has become more popular,
   many researchers have also become concerned with how to use mobile
   devices to support the museum's functions of lifelong learning.
   Although researchers have proposed several innovative types of
   mobile-device based electronic guidebooks, the effects of the most used
   audio-visual guidebooks have been rarely evaluated. This study explored
   the effect of a mobile electronic guidebook on visiting behaviors in a
   museum of history. Visitors' behaviors with two visiting modes
   (visiting with the electronic guidebook and visiting without
   supplementary tools) were compared. Forty-two college students were
   invited to visit the National Museum of History in Taiwan and were
   randomly assigned to one of the two visit modes. The results showed
   that the students with the electronic guidebook had a longer holding
   time with exhibits than the students without supplementary materials.
   The sequential analysis of visiting behaviors also showed that the
   students with the electronic guidebook displayed more inquisitive and
   structural behaviors when interacting with the exhibits.

AB Recent progress in wireless and sensor technologies has lead to a new
   development of learning environments, called context-aware ubiquitous
   learning environment, which is able to sense the situation of learners
   and provide adaptive supports. Many researchers have been investigating
   the development of such new learning environments; nevertheless, the
   criteria of establishing a context-aware ubiquitous learning
   environment have not yet been clearly defined, not to mention the
   strategies of conducting effective learning activities. To resolve
   these problems, this paper presents the basic criteria, strategies, and
   research issues of context-aware ubiquitous learning, and identifies
   the necessary check items as well for the development of such learning
   environment. Illustrative examples of conducting context-aware
   ubiquitous learning activities and the requirements of setting up such
   learning environment are also presented at the end of this paper.

AB In distance education, communications among students, educators, and
   administrators have been one of the most important problems. The
   distance education programs in The Open University of Hong Kong (OUHK)
   span not only Hong Kong but also many cities over a large area in
   China. To improve and monitor the quality of communications among
   students, tutors, and staff, we propose a communications management
   infrastructure based on an alert mechanism. Requests and messages in
   these systems (referred to as alerts) have to be delivered and handled
   timely to provide ubiquitous distance education communication support
   and management. We also propose using this platform for the integration
   of partners in China with the OUHK offices. Presently, most systems
   cannot address urgency and alerts are often handled in an ad-hoc
   manner. In this paper, we propose a sophisticated alert management
   system (AMS) for ubiquitous communications management in distance
   education under various requirements. We develop a model for managing
   alerts, in which alerts are associated with communication tasks and a
   set of parameters are captured for message routing and urgency
   management. The AMS matches the specialties of the educators and staff
   who receive an alert, based on the alert specification. We then propose
   a routing mechanism that is initiated when the alert message is not
   acknowledged or handled within the deadline, so that the alert can be
   re-routed if necessary. Monitoring is especially essential to ensure
   timeliness and availability of consultation or decision, otherwise
   suitable exceptions should be raised and handled. We outline our
   implementation framework for communications among education
   administrators, education staff, students, and system administrators,
   enhanced by alter management via various communication devices for
   ubiquitous support of communication in distance education.

ID DESIGN
AB Recent trends reveal that models of culture aid in mapping the design
   and analysis of information and communication technologies. Therefore,
   models of culture are powerful tools to guide the building of
   instructional products and services. This research examines the
   construction of the culture based model (CBM), a model of culture that
   evolved from historical and linguistic analyses of instructional
   products designed by and for African Americans. The findings
   extrapolated from the analyses reveal a treasure of cultural remnants.
   The cultural remnants provide evidence of how culture manifested in the
   instructional products. This data was further refined and generalized
   for a cross-cultural audience, resulting in the design factors of CBM.
   CBM is an intercultural instructional design framework that guides
   designers through the management, design, development, and assessment
   process while taking into account explicit culture-based
   considerations. The structure of CBM is presented and some ideas on its
   practical application are offered.

AB The structure and composite nature of a learning object is still open
   to interpretation. Although several theoretical studies advocate
   integrated approaches to the structure and aggregation level of
   learning objects, in practice, many content specifications, such as
   SCORM, IMS Content Packaging, and course authoring tools, do not
   explicitly state the aggregation level or granularity of learning
   content. The aim of this paper is to review, compare, and amalgamate
   different content models for learning objects into a single and
   coherent learning content hierarchy. To fulfil the objectives of this
   study, a substantive body of literature was reviewed and analysed to
   identify current issues in the field of learning objects, and more
   specifically, learning object content models.

TI Toward an open and interoperable e-learning portal: OEPortal
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE e-learning; WSRP (web service for remote portlets); BPEL4WS (business
   process execution language for web services); workflow orchestration
AB With the rapid advance of stand-alone e-learning systems, we believe a
   sharable and interoperable portal platform capable of integrating
   various existing learning systems is critical for the future
   development of e-learning systems. We highlight two problems as the
   root causes for current ineffective sharing of learning resources:
   learning object interoperability and learning activity
   interoperability. In this paper, we propose an open and interoperable
   e-learning portal architecture to solve these problems: 1) With regard
   to learning object interoperability, we propose WSRP+ service as an
   enhancement to WSRP standard to send presentation content and intercept
   crucial information from LMSs in order to facilitate the
   presentation-level integration of learning objects and keep the
   learner's learning status in our e-learning portal. 2) With regard to
   learning activity interoperability, BPEL4WS is used for the task-based
   orchestration of course workflows among shared learning systems, in
   which value-added tasks such as grading, evaluation, recording, etc.,
   can also be integrated as a whole. At the end of this paper, we present
   our prototype implementation to illustrate the feasibility of our
   approach.

AB Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) is essential to career development
   for teachers. Teachers can develop their own PCK by research-based
   activities such as action research and lesson study, with a particular
   emphasis on the employment of classroom practice, information
   technology, and collaborative learning. However, in recent studies,
   most of the models for enhancing teachers' PCK focus on individual
   teachers or teacher groups, and there is less chance of receiving
   support from the school leadership and institutional resources. This
   study proposes a development model for PCK known as the 3C-model and
   implements a support system for it, known as EDUPLAN. The model engages
   teachers in collaboratively constructing and sharing a knowledge-base
   of lesson plans with the involvement of different levels of school
   members for their school's curriculum. Through the process of
   school-based curriculum development, the model was found to increase
   teacher PCK and collaboration. Finally, the supporting system is found
   to be capable of enhancing performance in lesson plan construction and
   revision and thus the efficiency of PCK development.

   learning performance. In this paper, we propose a modular framework
   that can segment and transform teaching materials into modular learning
   objects based on the SCORM standard such that subject contents can be
   composed dynamically according to the profile and portfolio of
   individual students. An adaptive learning system has been developed
   based on this innovative approach. Based on the experimental results of
   a college computer course, we conclude that the proposed framework can
   be used to develop adaptive learning systems that benefit the students'
   learning achievements.

AB This paper addresses issues of using computer technology to support
   in-classroom teaching and learning regarding one of the most frequent
   problems in such scenarios: the students' attention. First, it presents
   the distraction and focus of attention problems that arise while using
   computer technology with off-the-shelf software for supporting
   different activities which take place in usual lectures. Examples of
   these activities are presentations of learning material, discussion,
   individual and collaborative problem solving, and difficulties of
   switching from one to another. A solution to this problem is an
   integrated approach with a particular implementation under the notion
   of "CiC". The implemented system attempts to reduce the number of
   interactions needed to switch from one activity to another as well as
   to reduce the cognitive load for both teacher and students. The usage
   of both this system and standard software are compared and research
   results are presented. Results show the CiC is useful to solve the
   problem.

AB With the flourishing development of e-Learning, more and more
   SCORM-compliant teaching materials are developed by institutes and
   individuals in different sites. In addition, the e-Learning grid is
   emerging as an infrastructure to enhance traditional e-Learning
   systems. Therefore, information retrieval schemes supporting
   SCORM-compliant documents on grid environments are gaining its
   importance. To minimize the query processing time and content
   transmission time, our idea is to use a bottom-up approach to
   reorganize documents in these sites based on their metadata, and to
   manage these contents in a centralized manner. In this paper, we design
   an indexing structure named Taxonomic Indexing Trees (TI-trees). A
   TI-tree is a taxonomic structure and has two novel features: 1)
   reorganizing documents according to the Classification metadata such
   that queries by classes can be processed efficiently and 2) indexing
   dispersedly stored documents in a centralized manner which is suitable
   for common grid middleware. This approach is composed of a Construction
   phase and a Search phase. In the former, a local TI-tree is built from
   each Learning Object Repository. Then, all local TI-trees are merged
   into a global TI-tree. In the latter, a Grid Portal processes queries
   and presents results with estimated transmission time to users.
   Experimental results show that the proposed approach can efficiently
   retrieve SCORM-compliant documents with good scalability.

TI A framework for adopting LMS to introduce e-learning in a traditional

DE learning management systems; blended learning; web enhancement;
   e-learning instructional model
AB As more and more teachers in tertiary education experiment with
   technology, looking for new ways of enhancing their traditional ways of
   teaching, the need of flexible tools able to support well planned
   blended learning scenarios emerges. Learning Management Systems,
   especially those which are based on open source software, have shown to
   be very helpful in reaching this goal. Nevertheless, technology alone
   is not sufficient because teachers have to understand beforehand the
   potentials it offers in order to be able to use it effectively in
   redesigning their educational scenarios.
   In this paper we present a framework for introducing e-learning in a
   traditional course. The framework can be used as a guideline for the
   development of an instructional model incorporating a pertinent
   pedagogical setup which federates learning and "learner-centered"
   factors. We illustrate this process with a case study that shows how
   the recommended method has been applied to make a successful transition
   to a blended learning format that combines face-to-face sessions with
   distance communication.
   Based on this experience and on the results from the evaluations we
   have conducted in the last few years (3 surveys with 316 participants),
   we claim that e-learning methods and tools can indeed help in
   efficiently supporting the students and in improving the quality of
   learning.

DE e-learning; uses and gratification expectancy; blended learning strategy
AB This study investigates 'how and why' students' 'Uses and Gratification
   Expectancy' (UGE) for e-learning resources influences their 'Perceived
   e-Learning Experience.' A 'Uses and Gratification Expectancy Model'
   (UGEM) framework is proposed to predict students' 'Perceived e-Learning
   Experience,' and their uses and gratifications for electronic media in
   a blended learning strategy. The study utilises a cross-sectional
   research design, and elicits data from secondary school students
   through a field survey-questionnaire. The findings suggest that there
   are significant relationships between five dimensions of students' UGE
   for e-learning resources, and their 'Perceived e-Learning Experience.'
   It is plausible that these UGE aspects of students' 'communication
   behaviour' towards electronic media are important determinants of
   effective integration of the e-learning resources in school-curriculum.
   While this research focuses on students at secondary-school level, some
   elements in the UGE model may apply to students using e-learning
   resources at other levels of their education. This model gives
   researchers and educators a new tool to forecast the success of
   development and deployment of e-learning resources in education systems.

   usage are considered: instructional and managerial. The data collected
   from 814 faculty members in Turkey were used to test the model by using
   LISREL 8.72; it explained 61% of the faculties ICT use, with a good
   model fit. The model supposes that the perceived attributes of ICT and
   ICT facilities in the universities predict the ICT use. The faculty
   members make use of ICT most as a means of communication and for
   searching for information about the course through the Internet; and
   the least, for publishing their lecture notes and the announcements
   concerning the course-assignments, projects-on WWW.

AB The use of instructional technologies such as PowerPoint T and WebCT T
   are nearly ubiquitous in contemporary college classrooms. The
   literature is rich with ideas about the transformative powers of
   technology. What is less understood is how users perceive technology
   and its effects on classroom dynamics such as student attendance and
   participation as well as student learning. The literature offers
   neither an empirical nor rhetorical consensus about the efficacy of
   classroom technology. This study explores perceptions about the effects
   of two commonly used technologies through surveys of faculty (n= 485)
   and students (n= 3145) at a large, public university. Results indicate
   that individual factors such as gender, grade point average,
   class/faculty rank, and length of tenure influence orientation toward
   technology. Results indicate student and faculty differ in their
   perceptions of the impact of technology on student attendance, class
   discussion, and connections between students. We explore potential
   reasons for these differences and how they provide clues for improving
   the usefulness of technology in meeting learning objectives for all
   students.

AB Recent interest in interactive video game technology (IVGT) has spurred
   the notion that exercise from this technology may have meaningful
   physiological and psychological benefits for children and adolescents.
   The purpose of this study was to examine the short-term psychological
   effects of interactive video game exercise in young adults and whether
   IVGT participation was capable of improving mood as has been shown for
   traditional forms of exercise. In addition, we were interested in
   comparing both actual physical exercise output and perceived exertion
   of that output across the exercise conditions. One-hundred and
   sixty-eight college students were assigned to one of three 30-minute
   conditions: 1) interactive video game cycle ergometer exercise, 2)
   regular cycle ergometer exercise, or 3) a video game-only control
   condition. Positive and negative mood (PANAS; Watson, Clark, &
   Tellegen, 1988) was assessed before and twice-after experimental
   conditions, and measures of actual and perceived physical exertion were
   collected at five-minute intervals across exercise conditions.
   Participants in the video-game control had higher post-activity
   negative affect immediately and 10-minutes post activity than either
   exercise group. In addition, exercise condition participants had higher
   positive mood at 10-minutes post activity compared to the video game
   control participants. Results do not support IVGT mood benefits over
   other forms of exercise, but do support immediate affective benefits of
   exercise compared to sedentary activity. It is concluded that while
   there is potential for interactive video-game based applications to
   elicit affective benefits, there is a need to examine circumstances
   under which these benefits are most likely to occur.

AB In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework for an anthropomorphic
   change agent to motivate pre-service teachers to integrate technology
   into teaching and learning. This agent is designed with a hybrid
   persona that simulates a mentor and plays both motivation and companion
   roles. Based on the theoretical grounding in motivation and change
   agency and related research, we propose that a computer-based change
   agent will impact pre-service teachers' attitudes toward technology
   integration and improve their abilities to be effective users of
   educational technology. The impact on learning and instruction is
   explained as a process of changing perceptions and concerns about the
   value of using technology to support their learning. We build on models
   of innovation-decision processes and attributes of adoption of
   innovation and concern-based adoption. Practical considerations for the
   design of a virtual change agent are provided with respect to
   appearance, voice and emotional expression. Further research is also
   discussed, especially regard to empirical validation of specific
   components of the framework and longitudinal studies of teacher
   attitudes.

AB In order to establish an online diagnostic system for Learning Style
   Estimation that contributes to the adaptation of learning objects, we
   propose an easily applicable expert system founded on Bayesian
   Networks. The proposed system makes use of Learning Style theories and
   associated diagnostic techniques, simultaneously avoiding certain error
   sources. It takes under consideration learners' answers to a specific
   questionnaire, as well as a classification of learners who have been
   previously examined. System application based on Kolb's Learning Style
   Inventory is also presented, in order to study the changes to the final
   estimation made by the system. The questionnaire in use is the David
   Kolb's Learning Style Inventory revised, an on-line form which avoids
   logical fault implications. With this aim, a case study has been
   carried out involving 885 university students, from which conclusions
   are drawn. As a result of the expert system use, the influence of
   factors, such as reflection of cross-cultural environment differences
   and/or of slippery or lucky answers' influence on learning style
   estimation is reduced.

TI Critical Reflective Practice as a Pivot in Transforming Science
   Education: A report of teacher-researcher collaborative interactions in
   response to assessment reforms
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID DESIGN
AB This paper investigates the impact of a current educational policy
   initiative in Singapore called 'Science Practical Assessment' (SPA).
   SPA is designed to overcome the limitations of single, high-stakes
   examinations by placing emphasis on research processes,
   entrepreneurship and the development of science practical skills.
   Structurally, SPA repositions teachers as central in the selection of
   items to teach and assess during the academic years leading up to
   O-level. However, it is contended that the effectiveness of SPA is
   rendered problematic without specific attention being paid to teachers'
   readiness and capacity to understand and implement assessment
   innovations. In response, the author describes and analyses how he
   formed a research partnership with a local physics teacher to
   investigate how SPA could be used as a tool to improve science
   pedagogy. Results suggest that while the pragmatic considerations of
   assessment reforms are not sufficient in themselves to bring about
   policymakers' desired outcomes, ways can be found to help teachers
   prepare for, bring about and crucially own change by adopting a
   critically reflective stance on problems and issues that arise when
   students work on completing laboratory tasks. The methods used in this
   study also identify some of the factors that impact on teachers'
   ability to influence positive developments at the department and school
   levels of an educational system. Overall, the intention is that the
   teacher development strategies and classroom practices illustrated in
   the paper will eventually inform a programme of interventionist action
   in science pedagogy and practical work assessment with applications
   both in and beyond the immediate study context.

ID CHROMOSOMES; FRAMEWORK; VIEW
AB Empirical investigations on students' conceptions of cell biology
   indicate major misunderstandings of scientific concepts even after
   thorough teaching. Therefore, the main aim of our research project was
   to investigate students' difficulties in learning this topic and to
   study the impact of learning activities on students' conceptions. Using
   the Model of Educational Reconstruction, a four-phase design was
   carried out. Firstly, there was the clarification of science subject
   matter. Secondly, students' conceptions were investigated, and finally,
   the learning activities were designed. An evaluation of these learning
   activities was carried out using five teaching experiments, each with
   three 9th grade students (15-16 years, Grammar school). Interpretation
   of students' pathways of thinking and their conceptual change during
   instruction was framed theoretically by experiential realism.
   Theoretical framework, methods and outcomes of the study may contribute
   to a deeper understanding of students' ways of thinking in the field of
   cell biology and reveal the process of conceptual development by using
   well planned learning activities.

AB The study investigated cognitive and motivational effects of two
   educational interventions, a conventional versus a student-oriented
   approach. We monitored the impact on the cognitive achievement outcome
   and the motivation of students. Both approaches dealt with the subject
   of birds and bird flight; the student-oriented approach consisted of a
   unit based on workstations, and the conventional one was taught in a
   more teacher-centred manner. A total of 326 secondary school pupils of
   the highest stratification level participated in this study. By using a
   pre-test, post-test and retention-test design, both approaches were
   evaluated with the same empirical batteries (by applying a cognitive
   item set and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory). The conventional
   approach provided higher achievement scores whereas the
   student-oriented approach showed a higher motivational rating.
   Comparing the student-oriented approach with and without introduction,
   the group with introduction attained higher achievement scores. The
   results are discussed in terms of general expectations about the
   cognitive outcome in open learning environments and self-determination
   theory. Educational implications are drawn concerning the
   implementation of learning at workstations in school curricula.

AB The purpose of this review is to present a comprehensive evaluation of
   science attitude instruments based on published psychometric evidence.
   A multitude of instruments have been used through the years and some
   have been linked to career choice and school performance.
   Substantiating such associations is of paramount importance if
   researchers wish to influence educational policy. However, associations
   are reduced, or hard to discover, if instruments have weak psychometric
   properties. Several databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles
   that discussed the development and use of science attitude instruments.
   Instruments were grouped into the following categories: attitudes
   toward science, scientific attitudes, nature of science, scientific
   career interests, and other. A data abstraction and scoring rubric was
   used to summarize and evaluate 150 published articles that spanned 66
   instruments. Most instruments had single study usage and showed an
   absence of psychometric evidence. This review demonstrated that there
   are few instruments available with the necessary psychometric data to
   merit recommendation. The review quantifies the current state of the
   research regarding the measurement of science attitude in students; the
   results should elicit further discussion and encourage more rigorous
   analyses of instruments. The findings may assist other researchers to
   select an instrument and alert them to its strengths and weaknesses.
   This review points the way forward for research in this field.
   Instruments already in existence should be used in repeat studies, and
   reliability and validity evidence should be collected and shared.

ID EDUCATION; CURRICULUM
AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the nature of students'
   responses to a cross-cultural science unit entitled Maintaining health.
   The unit was designed to help students to build bridges between their
   traditional practices and beliefs and western science concepts. This
   paper reports students' responses to a pre-test and post-test, and
   their reflections on their learning. The responses were analysed using
   the collateral learning model. There was evidence of parallel,
   dependent, and secured collateral learning. The implications for
   science teaching and for assessing science learning are discussed.

   CHILDHOOD
AB We investigated for the first time the genetic and environmental
   aetiology behind scientific achievement in primary school children,
   with a special focus on possible aetiological differences for boys and
   girls. For a representative community sample of 2,602 twin pairs
   assessed at age nine years, scientific achievement in school was rated
   by teachers based on National Curriculum criteria in three domains:
   Scientific Enquiry, Life Processes, and Physical Processes. Results
   indicate that genetic influences account for over 60% of the variance
   in scientific achievement, with environmental influences accounting for
   the remaining variance. Environmental influences were mainly of the
   non-shared variety, suggesting that children from the same family
   experience school environments differently. An analysis of sex
   differences considering differences in means, variances, and aetiology
   of individual differences found only differences in variance between
   the sexes, with boys showing greater variance in performance than girls.

TI Conceptual resources for learning science: Issues of transience and
   grain-size in cognition and cognitive structure
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID EPISTEMOLOGICAL RESOURCES; ALTERNATIVE CONCEPTIONS; PHYSICS; CHEMISTRY;
   STUDENTS; FRAMEWORKS; EDUCATION
AB Many studies into learners' ideas in science have reported that aspects
   of learners' thinking can be represented in terms of entities described
   in such terms as alternative conceptions or conceptual frameworks,
   which are considered to describe relatively stable aspects of
   conceptual knowledge that are represented in the learner's memory and
   accessed in certain contexts. Other researchers have suggested that
   learners' ideas elicited in research are often better understood as
   labile constructions formed in response to probes and generated from
   more elementary conceptual resources (e.g. phenomenological primitives
   or 'p-prims'). This 'knowledge-in-pieces perspective' (largely
   developed from studies of student thinking about physics topics), and
   the 'alternative conceptions perspective', suggests different pedagogic
   approaches. The present paper discusses issues raised by this area of
   work. Firstly, a model of cognition is considered within which the
   'knowledge-in-pieces' and 'alternative conceptions' perspectives
   co-exist. Secondly, this model is explored in terms of whether such a
   synthesis could offer fruitful insights by considering some candidate
   p-prims from chemistry education. Finally, areas for developing
   testable predictions are outlined, to show how such a model can be a
   'refutable variant' of a progressive research programme in learning
   science.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine whether science and
   non-science major students have different scientific epistemological
   views (SEVs). A multidimensional instrument previously developed by the
   authors was used to assess differences in college students' SEV of
   various aspects. A total of 220 freshmen (42% science and 58%
   non-science majors) attending two public universities participated in
   this investigation. Results indicated that the science majors have less
   sophisticated beliefs in the theory-laden and cultural-dependent
   aspects of science than non-science majors. Analysis of variance
   results further revealed significant differences in SEV dimensions
   among the three major fields: non-science, pure science, and science
   education. Science education students gained the lowest scores on the
   entire scale among the groups. Findings of this study imply that
   science major (including science education) students might be involved
   longer in such an epistemic environment that described scientific
   knowledge as objective and universal. It is also possible that beliefs
   about certainty and objectivity lead these students to select science
   as their major field. Implications for future research and science
   teacher education are discussed.

AB This study, carried out in England, examined the variation of attitudes
   towards science over the first three years of secondary schooling and
   with gender. The study in question was part of an evaluation of the Lab
   in a Lorry project, and involved 932 pupils completing a pre-measure
   questionnaire containing items looking at six separate attitude
   constructs. From these data, two main patterns emerged; pupils'
   attitudes towards science declined as they progressed through secondary
   school, and this decline was more pronounced for female pupils. These
   conclusions are largely in agreement with previous studies in this
   field. However, in examining separate attitude constructs, we were also
   able to identify that the sharpest decline occurred specifically for
   pupils' attitude towards learning science in school. Furthermore, using
   linear regression, we identified that, as pupils progress through
   school, this construct becomes a greater influence on attitudes towards
   future participation in science. Therefore, we also concluded that
   learning science in school is a particular area that needs to be
   concentrated upon, if we are to improve children's attitudes towards
   science. In the final part of the paper, we drew on interview data
   obtained from 44 pupils involved in the Lab in a Lorry study. Pupils'
   comments in these interviews provided further insight into why pupils
   are switched off by school science. We drew out the most prevalent
   themes that emerged in the interviews, in order to provide further
   insight into why pupils do not enjoy science in school.

AB In the studies reported here, we investigate the effects of context on
   students' molecular-level ideas regarding aqueous solutions. During
   one-on-one interviews, 19 general chemistry students recruited from a
   two-year community college and a research university in the United
   States were asked to describe their molecular-level ideas about various
   aqueous solutions in the contexts of conductivity and boiling-point
   (BP) elevation. Results indicate that context is important for
   determining the molecular-level ideas that students express.
   Specifically, students were significantly more likely to draw pictures
   of aqueous NaCl as separated ions in the conductivity context compared
   with the BP elevation context, for which they more often drew molecular
   NaCl. This phenomenon was particularly striking because the students
   drew molecular-level NaCl(aq) pictures in the BP elevation context just
   minutes after completing the identical task in the context of
   conductivity. Additional data from laboratory assignments and course
   examinations further indicate that, even if students are able to
   correctly represent the molecular level in some contexts, their
   knowledge may remain inert in slightly different contexts. The results
   emphasise the importance of the context dependence of molecular-level
   ideas and have implications for designing instruction in which students
   develop robust, coherent understandings that they can apply
   appropriately in new contexts.

ID CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; SCIENCE INSTRUCTION
AB In an action research study, 66 students from Year 11 in an Australian
   school were shown the colour of methyl violet indicator in some
   hydrochloric acid solutions, and then in an acetic acid solution. The
   intent was to create a cognitive conflict, resolution of which would
   lead to an understanding of the concept weak acid. Student learning
   emanating from the demonstration was evaluated by written answers to
   the following: 'Describe the demonstration', 'What was the aim of the
   demonstration?', 'Explain the observations', and 'What do you think you
   have learned?' Some students were also interviewed. Learning outcomes
   were disappointing, not because of failure to resolve the intended
   conflict, but because of failure to attend to the key features of the
   demonstration and failure to realize a conflict. Some interesting cases
   of unintended, and undesirable, learning occurred. The role of the
   teacher was a focus of this study, and recommendations to improve the
   conduct of cognitive conflict demonstrations were implemented in
   follow-up years, and improved learning outcomes resulted.

AB This study explored support for engagement in 2 settings: a high school
   basketball team and high school mathematics classrooms. Specifically,
   the study examined 3 aspects of these practices: (a) access to the
   domain, (b) opportunities to take on integral roles, and (c)
   opportunities for self-expression in the practice. Drawing on videotape
   and interview data from 2 African American high school students'
   participation in basketball and mathematics class, as well as
   interviews with players' teachers and coaches, this article analyzes
   how these 3 aspects of practices afforded differential engagement
   across settings. Findings indicated that the practice of basketball
   supported deep engagement as players had greater access to an
   understanding of the domain, were assigned and took up a unique role
   that was integral to the practice, and had opportunities to express
   themselves and feel competent. The high school mathematics classroom
   differentially afforded these opportunities, with I student taking them
   up and the other being unable to, and thus being less engaged.
   Potential implications of these 3 aspects of the practices for
   students' practice-linked identities and learning are discussed.

AB This study examines the practical work of a pair of students and an
   instructor using probeware in a mechanics lab. The aim of the study is
   to describe and discuss a type of interactional sequence that we refer
   to as dark matter, the ordinary backdrop to the extraordinary sequences
   that are easily recognizable as clear-cut instances of learning.
   Although this work is downplayed in the research literature, describing
   it is critical to properly understanding lab work as an educational
   practice. With a focus on the negotiation of disciplined perception, we
   analyze a number of episodes wherein a pair of students and an
   instructor struggle with the construction and interpretation of a graph
   depicting a linear relationship between force and acceleration. We
   demonstrate an intimate interplay between how the students display
   their problems and understandings and how the instructor tries to make
   the subject matter content visible and thus learnable. The analyzed
   episodes are illuminating with regard to the analytical notion of
   disciplined perception as applied to graph interpretation; the
   cognitive and practical competencies involved in producing,
   recognizing, and understanding graphs in mechanics; and the interactive
   work by which these competencies are made into objects of learning and
   instruction.

AB Children's worlds are increasingly populated by intelligent
   technologies. This has raised a number of questions about the ways in
   which technology can change children's ideas about important concepts,
   like what it means to be alive or smart. In this study, we examined the
   impact of experience with intelligent technologies on children's ideas
   about robot intelligence. A total of 60 children aged 4 through 7 were
   asked to identify the intellectual, psychological, and biological
   characteristics of 8 entities that differed in terms of their life
   status and intellectual capabilities. Results indicated that as
   children gained experience in this domain, they began to differentiate
   robots from other familiar entities. This differentiation was indicated
   by a unique pattern of responses about the intellectual and
   psychological characteristics of robots. These findings suggest that
   experience may yield a more highly developed viewpoint that reflects an
   appreciation of the distinctions between biological life, machines, and
   artificially intelligent technologies.

AB We report on the initial attempts at evaluating at scale a particular
   technological/curricular innovation that enables more students to
   develop deeper knowledge. The methods, issues, and findings of the
   current pilot experiment speak not only to the success of SimCalc
   MathWorlds, the focus of our research program, but also to the
   evaluation at scale of a broad class of representationally innovative
   technologies and to the merit of long-term investment in design-based
   research. In particular, we present conditions and findings from a
   completed pilot experiment involving 21 seventh-grade mathematics
   teachers from Texas. Pilot outcomes suggest that (a) innovative
   representational technologies can have an important impact on student
   learning, (b) considerable impact can be found across a wide range of
   teachers and conditions, and (c) these gains can be detected even in
   the absence of other desirable conditions. In particular, detection of
   student gains does not, in our case, depend on having a long-term
   context of learning, long-term teacher professional development, or a
   shift to learner-centered constructivist pedagogy. The full experiment
   will replicate and extend our experimental design with a wider range of
   teachers and schools, model the factors that contribute to classroom
   success with such technology, and explore what happens as research
   support fades away.

TI Beyond threaded discussion: Representational guidance in asynchronous
   collaborative learning environments
SO COMPUTERS & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE computer-mediated communication; cooperative/collaborative learning;
   human-computer interface; knowledge maps; representational guidance
AB Although most online learning environments are predominately text
   based, researchers have argued that representational support for the
   conceptual structure of a problem would address problems of coherence
   and convergence that have been shown to be associated with threaded
   discussions and more effectively support collaborative knowledge
   construction. The study described in this paper sets out to investigate
   the merits of knowledge mapping representations as an adjunct to or
   replacement for threaded discussion in problem solving by
   asynchronously communicating dyads. Results show that users of
   knowledge maps created more hypotheses earlier in the experimental
   sessions and elaborated on them more than users of threaded
   discussions. Participants using knowledge maps were more likely to
   converge on the same conclusion and scored significantly higher on
   post-test questions that required integration of information
   distributed across dyads in a hidden profile design, suggesting that
   there was greater collaboration during the session. These results were
   most consistent when a knowledge map with embedded notes was the
   primary means of interaction rather than when it augmented a threaded
   discussion.
   The paper also offers a methodological contribution: a paradigm for
   practical experimental study of asynchronous collaboration. It is
   crucial to understand how to support collaborative knowledge
   construction in the asynchronous settings prevalent in online learning,
   yet prior experimental research has focused on face-to-face and
   synchronous collaboration due to the pragmatic problems of conducting
   controlled studies of asynchronous interaction. A protocol is outlined
   that enables study of asynchronous collaboration in a controlled
   setting. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate undergraduate students'
   performance while exposed to complementary computational modelling
   activities to improve physics learning, using the softwares Modellus.
   Interpretation of kinematics graphs was the physics topic chosen for
   investigation. The theoretical framework adopted was based on Halloun's
   schematic modelling approach and on Ausubel's meaningful learning
   theory. The results of this work show that there was a statistically
   significant improvement in the experimental group students' performance
   when compared to the control group, submitted just to a conventional
   teaching method. Students' perception with respect to the concepts and
   mathematical relations, as well as the motivation to learn, originated
   by the activities, have played a fundamental role in these findings.

ID THINKING
AB The design and empirical validation of a computer-based learning
   environment for acquiring long division skills, called the long
   division machine (LDM), are described. The construction of the LDM is
   primarily based on the didactic method of progressive schematisation.
   It offers the student a game-like environment for solving division
   problems by simulating the cooperation with an expert teacher or
   co-student who is responsible for the lower-level, routine, arithmetic
   subtasks of the overall division task. In a pilot study and two
   experiments the effects of several aspects of the LDM user interface on
   solution behaviour and performance were investigated, including the
   effect of gradually forcing the student to adopt a more efficient
   solution strategy, whenever this was possible. The ability of students
   to transfer their acquired knowledge and skills to an unaided problem
   solving context was also investigated. The results show that the LDM
   has the potential to improve and supplement current didactic methods
   for teaching long division skills. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The efficacy of individual components of an online course on positive
   course outcome was examined via stepwise multiple regression analysis.
   Outcome was measured as the student's total score on all exams given
   during the course. The predictors were page hits, discussion posts, and
   discussion reads. The vast majority of the variance of outcome was
   accounted for by total page hits. Participation in discussion had
   little to no effect on performance as measured by outcome on exams. The
   results were double cross-validated with a sample chosen from another
   class. There was no shrinkage, indicating that the equations derived
   from the two samples were very reliable. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB E-learning is emerging as the new paradigm of modern education.
   Worldwide, the e-learning market has a growth rate of 35.6%, but
   failures exist. Little is known about why many users stop their online
   learning after their initial experience. Previous research done under
   different task environments has suggested a variety of factors
   affecting user satisfaction with e-Learning. This study developed an
   integrated model with six dimensions: learners, instructors, courses,
   technology, design, and environment. A survey was conducted to
   investigate the critical factors affecting learners' satisfaction in
   e-Learning. The results revealed that learner computer anxiety,
   instructor attitude toward e-Learning, e-Learning course flexibility,
   e-Learning course quality, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use,
   and diversity in assessments are the critical factors affecting
   learners' perceived satisfaction. The results show institutions how to
   improve learner satisfaction and further strengthen their e-Learning
   implementation. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes the Generic Automated Marking Environment (GAME)
   and provides a detailed analysis of its performance in assessing
   student programming projects and exercises. GAME has been designed to
   automatically assess programming assignments written in a variety of
   languages based oil the "structure" of the source code and the
   correctness of the program's output. Currently, the system is able to
   mark programs written in Java, C++ and the C language. To use the
   system, instructors are required to provide a simple "marking schema"
   for each given assessment item, which includes pertinent information
   such as the location of files and the model solution. In this research,
   GAME has been tested on a number of student programming exercises and
   assignments and its performance has been compared against that of a
   human marker. An in-depth statistical analysis of the comparison is
   presented, providing encouraging results and directions for employing
   GAME as a tool for teaching and learning. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Since online learning technology, such as streaming video, was
   introduced to the college distance-learning environment, there has been
   a need to Study the attitudes of college Students toward the use of
   this modality in hybrid Courses. Understanding students' attitudes
   toward using online materials and the impact oil class attendance is
   not only essential to ascertain how effectively the online content is
   delivered, it also helps teaching faculty prepare online courses and
   education programs. This paper Studies the attitudes of college
   Students' about online materials in a hybrid Lipper division
   communications class. Student attitudes towards combining
   distance-learning techniques with traditional lecture tended to be
   positive. Students field the belief that hybrid courses have a negative
   impact on attendance, but they did not self-report an actual impact.
   Students do believe that they benefit from this technology, but the
   belief is strongest in those who are most computer/internet literate.
   How these attitudes/beliefs impact the Student in the context of a
   rural culture will be discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

TI A practical ontology query expansion algorithm for semantic-aware

LA English
DT Article
DE architectures for educational technology system; programming and
   programming languages; simulations
ID PRINCIPLES; WEB
AB Following the rapid development of Internet, particularly web page
   interaction technology, distant e-learning has become increasingly
   realistic and popular. To solve the problems associated with sharing
   and reusing teaching materials in different e-learning systems, several
   standard formats, including SCORM, IMS, LOM, and AICC, etc., recently
   have been proposed by several different international organizations.
   SCORM LOM, namely learning object metadata, facilitates the indexing
   and searching of learning objects in a learning object repository
   through extended sharing and searching features. However, LOM suffers a
   weakness in terms of semantic-awareness capability. Most information
   retrieval systems assume that users have cognitive ability regarding
   their needs. However, in e-learning systems, users may have no idea of
   what they are looking for and the learning object metadata. This study
   presents an ontological approach for semantic-aware learning object
   retrieval. This approach has two significant novel features: a fully
   automatic ontology-based query expansion algorithm for inferring and
   aggregating user intention based on their original short query, and
   another "ambiguity removal" procedure for correcting inappropriate user
   query terms. This approach is sufficiently generic to be embedded to
   other LOM-based search mechanisms for semantic-aware learning object
   retrieval.
   Focused on digital learning material and contrasted to other
   traditional keyword-based search technologies, the proposed approach
   has experimentally demonstrated significantly improved retrieval
   precision and recall rate. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we examine the potential use of animation for supporting
   the teaching of some of the mathematical concepts that underlie
   computer games development activities, such as vector and matrix
   algebra. An experiment was conducted with a group of UK undergraduate
   computing students to compare the perceived usefulness of animated and
   static learning materials for teaching such concepts. Undergraduate
   computer game development courses are currently a growing area of UK
   higher education. Computer game development can often involve the use
   of mathematical modelling of two-dimensional and three-dimensional
   computer game objects and their interactions. Overall, it appeared that
   animated learning materials appeared to be perceived as being more
   useful to undergraduate computer games students than traditional
   learning materials for learning such concepts. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Most computer users have to deal with major software upgrades every
   6-18 months. Given the pressure of having to adjust so quickly and so
   often, it is reasonable to assume that users will express emotional
   reactions such as anger, desperation, anxiety, or relief during the
   learning process. To date, the primary emotion studied with respect to
   computer knowledge has been anxiety or fear. The purpose of the
   following study was to explore the relationship among a broader range
   of emotions (anger, anxiety, happiness, and sadness) and the
   acquisition of nine computer related skills. Pre- and post-surveys were
   given to 184 preservice education students enrolled in 8 month,
   integrated laptop program. Happiness was expressed most of the time -
   anxiety, anger, and sadness were reported sometimes. Anxiety and anger
   levels decreased significantly, while computer knowledge increased. All
   four emotions were significantly correlated with all nine computer
   knowledge areas at the beginning of the program, but happiness and
   anxiety were the only emotions significantly related to change in
   computer knowledge. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Psychological studies have shown that personal beliefs about learning
   and environmental preferences affect learning behaviors. However, these
   learner characteristics have not been widely discussed in the web-based
   context. By developing questionnaires, this study attempted to detect
   learners' web-based learning environmental preferences (WLEP) and
   beliefs about web-based learning (BWL). The scope of WLEP focused on
   the pedagogical dimension of the web-based learning environment, while
   BWL concerned the attributes and control factors of the web-based
   learning. There were about five hundreds of Taiwan university students
   participating in the study. Through factor analysis, the scales
   discussed in the study revealed a satisfactory validity and reliability
   in assessing students' preferences and beliefs. Further analyses showed
   that university students preferred more of individual and structured
   instructional configurations while expected the outward mode of
   interaction. In general, students held a rather contextual belief about
   web-based learning, which was found to be correlated with their
   environmental preferences. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The current paper details results from the Girls and ICT survey phase
   of a three year study investigating factors associated with low
   participation rates by females in education pathways leading to
   professional level information and communications technology (ICT)
   professions. The study is funded through the Australian Research
   Council's (ARC) Linkage Grants Scheme. It involves a research
   partnership between Education Queensland (EQ), industry partner
   Technology One and academic researchers at (affiliation removed for
   review purposes). Respondents to the survey were 1453 senior high
   school girls. Comparisons were drawn between Takers (n = 13 1) and Non
   Takers (it = 1322) of advanced level computing subjects. Significant
   differences between the groups were found on four questions: "The
   subjects are interesting"; "I am very interested in computers"; "The
   subject will be helpful to me in my chosen career path after school";
   and "It suited my timetable". The research has demonstrated that senior
   high school girls tend to perceive advanced computing subjects as
   boring and they express a strong aversion to computers. (C) 2007

AB The use of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has expanded rapidly
   over recent years mainly due to the advances in communication and
   information technology. Availability of advanced mobile technologies
   provides several benefits to e-learning by creating an additional
   channel of access with mobile devices such as PDAs and mobile phones.
   This paper describes the design issues that were considered for the
   development and the implementation of a CAT on mobile devices, the
   computerized adaptive test oil mobile devices (CAT-MD). Throughout the
   development of the system, formative evaluation was an integral part of
   the design methodology. The recommendations, suggestions and the
   results of the formative evaluation were used to improve the system in
   order to make the assessment procedure more effective and efficient.
   These results of the formative evaluation are also presented here. (C)

AB This paper deals with the development of a generalized model for
   version control systems application as a support in a range of
   project-based learning methods. The model is given as UML sequence
   diagram and described in detail. The proposed model encompasses a wide
   range of different project-based learning approaches by assigning a
   supervisory role either to instructor or students in different project
   stages. Different strategies for supervisor role assignment are given.
   Project duration, project milestones, as well as a number of team
   members are discussed in respect to project-based learning method that
   the proposed model supports. Possible implementations of different
   project-based learning approaches on the proposed model are
   demonstrated by setting the model parameters. Version control server
   security issues are discussed in the manner of implementation aspects
   of the proposed model. One of possible model implementations is
   evaluated in respect of cooperation on the test group of 21 students.
   Implementation details are presented and compared with other
   approaches. Mentoring and monitoring students efforts during the
   development by implementing proposed model with specific model settings
   introduces controlled cooperation with high clarity in evaluation of
   individual students work. Using open source version control software
   oil Linux platform, with web interface package, we implemented a
   low-cost support for project-based learning. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB In the past, the term e-learning referred to any method of learning
   that used electronic delivery methods. With the advent of the Internet
   however, e-learning has evolved and the term is now most commonly used
   to refer to online courses. A multitude of systems are now available to
   manage and deliver learning content online. While these have proved
   popular, they are often single-user learning environments which provide
   little in the way of interaction or stimulation for the student. As the
   concept of lifelong learning now becomes a reality and thus more and
   more people are partaking ill online courses, researchers are
   constantly exploring innovative techniques to motivate online students
   and enhance the e-learning experience. This article presents our
   research in this area and the resulting development of CLEV-R, a
   Collaborative Learning Environment with Virtual Reality. This web-based
   system uses Virtual Reality (VR) and multimedia and provides
   communication tools to support collaboration among students. In this
   article, we describe the features of CLEV-R, its adaptation for mobile
   devices and present the findings from an initial evaluation. (C) 2006

AB This paper argues for understanding ICT from the standpoint of
   philosophical world views. We present a framework, based on Pepper's
   root-metaphors (Formism, Contextualism, Mechanism, Organicism, and
   Animism/Mysticism) and we illustrate the use of the framework by
   looking at a common example of ICT: e-mail. It is argued that such a
   framework is potentially helpful to ICT teachers, especially when they
   work with pre-service education students who are struggling with how to
   integrate ICT critically into their future classrooms. (C) 2007

ID PRIOR KNOWLEDGE; HYPERTEXT; PHYSICS
AB This study investigates the interaction of a group of freshmen enrolled
   in a Pre Service Physics Teacher Training Course with a mechanics
   hypermedia program. Data were obtained to discuss hypertextual
   navigation guided by the following questions: (i) How can the students'
   navigation in this hypermedia program be characterized? (ii) How does
   this relate to their prior knowledge in mechanics? The sequence
   analysis of the events collected from the log files was used to
   characterize students' navigation and a mechanics test assessed
   students' prior knowledge. The inspection of students' navigation
   graphs made it possible to associate the structure of navigation to
   prior knowledge in mechanics. Three patterns of navigation are proposed
   associated to different levels of students' prior knowledge and to
   different roles performed by the program. In the organized navigation,
   the student who best performed in the pre test seemed to be reviewing
   content he already knew, using the system as a database. In the
   conceptual navigation the students who presented difficulties in the
   pre test spent different times in the pages as they were addressing
   conceptual difficulties, using the system as a support for learning.
   The students who scored the lowest in the test performed a disoriented
   navigation, spending much less than the adequate time to interact
   meaningfully with the content. The role that previous knowledge in
   mechanics plays in these patterns of navigation was related to the
   function that Ausubel's subsumers perform in learning. The results
   indicate that hypertextual navigation can provide information about
   students' conditions to engage in meaningful learning, which could be
   used to help the teacher personalize instruction. (C) 2007 Elsevier

DE simulation; learning; lifelong learning; computer-mediated communication
AB Continuing professional development (CPD) and life-long learning are
   vital to both individual and organisational success. For higher
   education, the intensive resource requirements requisite in the
   development of e-learning content and the challenges in accommodating
   different learning styles, developing an e-learning program can be a
   resource intensive exercise. A blended learning program has been
   developed in Ireland in all attempt to address the CPD needs of Irish
   construction professionals. This initiative attempts to strike a
   balance between the considerable resources required in the development
   of an e-learning initiative while addressing staff concerns in
   integrating technology in the delivery of programs. This pilot explores
   the issues encountered in integrating a simulation game, called MERIT,
   on a module as part of this blended learning program. The key finding
   from this research indicates that simulation games can play a very
   effective role in the delivery of lifelong learning opportunities aimed
   at the construction industry. However, management of the integration of
   a simulation game into a program requires careful planning,
   establishing key milestone dates and encouraging online collaboration
   through assigning of marks for effort and use of voice over IP
   communications. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines the different dimensions of scaffolding for online
   historical inquiry based on a case study of two secondary-two history
   classes from a neighborhood school in Singapore. The data collected for
   the study include video and screen captures, focus group interview,
   digital artifacts, and students' survey. Using sample transcripts and
   observation extracts, the authors discuss how the different scaffolds
   facilitate students' learning and how the students interact with the
   scaffolds to achieve a better performance. The fixed scaffolds in this
   study include written prompts and argumentation template; while the
   adaptive scaffolds include questioning, modeling and peer interaction.
   The findings indicate that these scaffolds have benefited the students
   in each step of the online historical inquiry. The analyses suggest
   that the different scaffolds working as a system may have helped
   improve lower secondary students' online historical inquiry skills. (C)

AB The purpose of this study is to explore the learning effect related to
   different learning styles in a Web-based virtual science laboratory for
   elementary school students. The online virtual lab allows teachers to
   integrate information and communication technology (ICT) into science
   lessons. The results of this experimental teaching method demonstrate
   that: (a) students in the experimental group using the online virtual
   lab achieved better grades than those in the control group under
   traditional class instruction, (b) in the experimental group, grade
   achievements of students having different learning styles were not
   significantly different from each other leading us to conclude that the
   Web-based virtual learning environment is suitable for various learning
   styles, (c) students with the "accommodator" learning style made the
   most significant achievements in this study, the scores obtained by the
   experimental group being remarkably better than those in the control
   group, and (d) up to 75% of the students surveyed indicated that they
   preferred using the Web-based virtual lab to reading textbooks only.
   The results of the experimental teaching and the survey show the
   feasibility and effectiveness of the Web-based learning environment
   being studied. It encourages further development of the Web-based
   virtual lab. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   associated with behavioral intention. In addition, the results also
   partially support that perceived resources have impacts on online
   learning adoption: Perceived ease of use, internal computing support,
   internal computing training, and external computing support have
   positive effects on perceived usefulness. Furthermore, internal
   computing support, internal computing training, external computing
   support, external computing training, and external equipment
   accessibility have positive effects on perceived ease of use.
   Recommendations for promoting adoption of the online learning system
   are subsequently discussed, along with suggestions for improving
   overall system design. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports on a case study of a teacher from a technical
   education institution who explored the educational affordances of PDA
   technology over a period of six months. Based oil this teacher's
   perspectives, the study was designed to inform our own understanding of
   educational affordances of this new and emerging technology.
   Understanding of educational affordances is important in the context of
   planning a suitable intervention to support pedagogically effective
   integration of PDA technology. The study explicated a set of five
   affordances of PDA technology: as a multimedia-access tool,
   connectivity tool, capture tool, representational tool and analytical
   tool. We call on further research to expand this set into a more
   comprehensive collage of educational affordances of PDA technology. (C)

AB This exploratory study tests the assertion that instructional
   strategies that match field-dependence status of students are most
   effective. The study conducted with 12 graduate students registered in
   a graduate level online course. An online version of the Psychological
   Differentiation Inventory was used to measure the field-dependence
   status of students. Students' perceived learning outcomes, their effort
   and involvement, and level of interaction that they perceived in online
   course module were measured through an online questionnaire. Results
   suggested that matches between students' learning styles and
   instructional strategies did not affect learner perception of their own
   learning outcomes, level of effort and involvement, and level of
   interactions in the course. Data also indicated that no single
   instructional strategy, among three instructional strategies tested,
   emerged as superior for high and low field-dependent online students.

AB As the use of web-based homework delivery and checking systems expands,
   we have greater need to evaluate how students engage with these systems
   and how changes in the systems influence student behavior. Reported
   here is the assessment of WeBWorK, an open-source web-based homework
   program used largely in postsecondary math and science courses, with
   recent extension to high school courses. WeBWorK draws from a large
   library of problems to generate individual assignments and provides
   immediate feedback about correctness of students' answers. WeBWorK
   allows entries in multiple choice, formula and numerical formats. The
   entries recorded by the system create an extensive database of student
   interactions with the system.
   In our two-part study, we (1) review 2387 student surveys about WeBWorK
   in three semesters across a range of mathematics courses and (2) test a
   model designed to classify student responses to system feedback,
   permitting a fine-grained analysis of the system's records at the
   keystroke level for a cohort of 96 Calculus I students.
   Based on this data, our goals are, first, to understand how students
   use the system and respond to its feedback; second, to analyze the
   impact of upgrades to the system interface on student users, and third,
   to evaluate the efficiency of training raters to classify student
   records.
   We find that the introduction of new features to the WeBWorK interface
   (improvements generated by our initial assessment) were welcomed by
   most students and reduced the overall number of submitted errors by
   half by the third year of the study. Importantly, the interface
   improvements reduced the number of errors that were not pedagogically
   useful. We also find that our error classification model, called here
   the Student Response Model, was a good fit for our student sample, as
   reflected by inter-rater reliability of three raters who coded the
   student records. In sum, our error classification model appears to be
   useful for analyzing formula entries. To make this assessment model
   widely available, we designed a system of exercises to train raters to
   classify student response files for WeBWorK and similar web-based
   systems. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports the findings of a study that explored which
   characteristics of electronic textbooks correlated with knowledge
   acquisition by learners of different achievement levels. The study was
   carried out on 35 units of electronic textbooks that were studied by 19
   high-achieving and 19 low-achieving students in four Estonian schools.
   The low-achieving students profited from clear instructions, familiar
   icons, examples, and answering from the keyboard. The high-achieving
   students benefited from key-combinations, menus with different levels,
   the Internet, analogies and lower density of terms in the content of
   the material. In electronic textbooks, not only the content, but also
   the design of the software, should be different for learners with a
   different achievement level. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, e-learning in Taiwan's higher education faces new challenges
   as the Ministry of Education begins to loosen its control over
   degree-awarding programs. Studies on stakeholder perceptions toward
   important e-learning issues become critical at this juncture for policy
   makers to make viable investment decisions toward e-learning programs.
   Although a typology of teacher perception with corresponding strategies
   in e-learning has been studied, the student perspective is missing in
   the teacher-student dynamics. To comprehend the teacher's and student's
   perceptions on institutional concerns toward e-learning issues, this
   study thus develops a student typology based on the methodology and
   questionnaire items used in a previous study on teachers. Two totally
   distinct groups of students, namely the skeptics and the optimists, are
   identified in the cluster analysis using four higher-level issue
   constructs emerging from a factor analysis of 30 variables. The
   findings on student typology and comparisons with teacher typology are
   then summarized along with strategies in the discussion and
   implications. This study should provide school policy makers a
   comprehensive insight on stakeholder perceptions for better e-learning
   decisions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Formative computer assisted assessment has become increasingly
   attractive in Higher Education where providing useful feedback to large
   numbers of students can be difficult. However, the nature of such
   assessments has often been limited to objective questions such as
   multiple-choice. This paper reports on the development and initial
   trialling of a more innovative, formative use of computer assisted
   assessment in a Higher Education context. The European funded PePCAA
   (Pedagogical Psychology Computer Assisted Assessment) project developed
   a series of scenario-based computer-delivered formative assessments of
   pedagogical psychology for teachers and trainee teachers, using a range
   of software features, including the addition of confidence measurement.
   The project had a two-fold aim: to provide a tool to improve
   understanding of pedagogical psychology and to explore the potential of
   more innovative techniques of computer assisted assessment to motivate
   students and to assess deeper learning. The combination of
   computer-delivered formative assessment with innovative question styles
   and confidence ratings is believed to be unique for pedagogical
   psychology. Scenarios were based on realistic classroom situations and
   focused on problem solving or on utilising best practice. The PePCAA
   Learning Assessment Circle (PLAC) provided a framework for indexing the
   kinds of processes required of users. In the UK, small scale trialling
   involved a total of 23 teacher trainees such that each assessment was
   attempted by about seven participants. Participants completed
   evaluation questionnaires after each assessment. Responses from
   learners indicated that the UK scenarios were generally very well
   received and had at least partly achieved the aim of stimulating deeper
   learning. Transfer of assessments between countries proved more
   difficult than expected. The next stage of development should be to
   conduct a larger pilot, thus allowing full investigation of the
   reliability and validity of the assessments. There is also scope for
   further development of the PePCAA approach and for its application in
   other subjects. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As schools are increasingly encouraging students to use the Internet
   and web-based technology at home and in the classroom, concerns among
   some parents have increased. Today's parents have learned about
   computers as adults and did not receive guided participation as
   children either from their parents or from their teachers.
   The essence of this paper is twofold: (a) to investigate how parents
   view their children's opportunity to acquire new educational and
   interpersonal experiences from the introduction of collaborative
   learning activities by distance via video-conferencing in school
   settings and (b) to examine the differences in parents' attitudes to
   the use of the Internet and web based technologies by elementary
   students in the family home as an acknowledgment of their importance in
   their children's day-to-day social and educational activities, in two
   developing but still traditional European countries. Using data from
   two groups of parents (N=98) - one from an urban province of Crete
   (Rethymno) and the other from a rural province of Cyprus (Avgorou), the
   present paper showed that parents respond to the "newness" of digital
   collaborative learning and interpersonal activities of their children
   according to their level of use and perceived compatibility of the
   information and communication technologies. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB This paper describes some of the consequences of introducing a
   face-to-face contact during an online collaborative learning session.
   Previous research on the development of online groups has suggested a
   critical transition period at the midpoint of a collaborative task in
   which group members redefine their behavior. The purpose of the present
   study was to determine whether face-to-face contact between
   participants during this period influences the patterns of
   participation, interaction, affect and behavior over time. Results show
   that a face-to-face contact introduced at the midpoint of a
   collaborative task has a positive influence on participation. However,
   a time sequence analysis of interactions revealed a further transition
   which appears between the face-to-face contact and the deadline. This
   transition is characterized by a decline of participation and
   task-focused interactions. At the same time, the analyses revealed an
   increase of interactions oriented towards emotional regulation and
   coordination, as well as a greater need of face-to-face contact, desire
   to drop out, and use of synchronous communications. These findings are
   based on an in-depth and longitudinal examination of a small sample,
   which limits their generalizability, but they may have a number of
   implications for the design of blended learning programs and the
   facilitation of collaborative tasks in distributed learning
   environments. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent research has provided evidence that students' computer use at
   home is positively associated with their performance at school.
   However, most of the previous studies have failed to take into account
   the multiple determination of school performance and, in addition, to
   explain why using computers at home should benefit students' academic
   achievement. The study described in this article takes a step towards
   filling this gap by circumventing the theoretical and methodological
   problems of previous research. First, we analyzed students' home
   computer use and their performance in mathematics while accounting for
   other factors that have been found to affect students' achievement.
   Second, we investigated possible differences in students' school
   performance depending on how they used the computer. Based on the data
   from German students who took part in the Programme for International
   Student Assessment (PISA) in 2003, our results showed that students'
   access to a computer was not linked with their performance in
   mathematics. In addition, it did not matter how often students used a
   computer at home. A positive effect on mathematical achievement was,
   however, observed for a small group of students who used the computer
   in a self-determined way that largely engaged them in problem-solving
   activities. Overall, the findings indicate that for the majority of
   students the computer had no substantial influence on their academic
   achievement. At the same time, the results are suggestive of ways in
   which performance in mathematics might be enhanced through the use of
   computers. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This experimental study investigated the effectiveness of structured
   Web-Based Bulletin Board (WBB) discussions in improving the critical
   thinking (CT) skills of learners involved in veterinary distance
   learning, as well as their attitudes toward learning via WBBs. The two
   dependent variables were learners' CT skills and their attitudes toward
   learning via WBBs. The learners' CT skills were examined in different
   ways: (a) quantitative method: California Critical Thinking Skills Test
   (CCTST) to holistically investigate the changes in learners' CT skills,
   and (b) qualitative method: Interaction Analysis Model to investigate
   learners' interaction patterns in different phases of the WBB
   discussions. Detailed information about inter-rater reliability, the
   training of the coders, and the coding process is provided. The
   findings indicated that structured WBBs significantly improved
   learners' CT skills and attitudes toward learning via WBBs. (c) 2007

AB Computer-supported collaborative argumentation can improve
   understanding and problem-solving skills. This study uses WebCT to
   explore the improvement of argumentation in asynchronous, web-based
   discussions through goal instructions, which are statements at the end
   of a discussion prompt indicating what students should achieve. In a
   previous study (Nussbaum 2005), the goal instruction 'generate as many
   reasons as possible' resulted in more balanced argumentation in an
   online environment. This study attempts to replicate this finding. It
   also examines the role of prior attitudes, knowledge and interest, and
   also the effect of elaborating on possible lines of reasoning in the
   question prompt. The goal instruction to generate as many reasons as
   possible (goal/no goal) was crossed with question elaboration
   (elaborated/unelaborated question) in a 2 x 2 randomized design using
   131 undergraduates. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to
   complete the attitude survey before discussion. Results indicated that,
   when prior knowledge was controlled, the reason goal instruction
   positively affected argument development and opposing view exploration,
   but only for high-issue knowledge students. The sheer volume of notes
   created by the online environment may have caused cognitive overload
   for low-issue knowledge students. Question elaboration promoted
   balanced argumentation for all students, but especially those with low
   knowledge.

AB The literature seems to suggest that women may be at risk from being
   excluded from adult education programmes, which use e-learning,
   especially when they have low economic status. Based on a survey of 551
   women, family day care providers, we conclude that there is a
   persistent divide in PC access and use, as well as in perceived PC
   skills according to age. Yet, this divide seems to run less along
   traditional lines, suggesting that personal factors play a more
   important role. Motivation and anxiety are two related but distinct
   personal factors that influence computer use and skills in this
   population. We also found that these factors are mediated by the family
   context: motivation is higher when (young) children are present in the
   family. Moreover, children may represent an important form of social
   support for women not yet using computers. This study concludes that
   the concerns about the gender gap in computer use may benefit from
   taking the scaffolding possibilities of the family into consideration
   and that there may be a case for growing optimism in the use of
   information and communication technology for adult learning in
   specific, gender-segregated professions with low status.

AB Virtual learning environments (VLEs) are widespread in higher education
   today, typically used to deliver instructional materials and facilitate
   communication within a course. This study aimed to investigate the
   task-technology fit of VLEs for their two main groups of users:
   instructors and students, using the VLE WebCT. Task-technology fit,
   user satisfaction, attitude towards use and anticipated consequences of
   use were found to be significantly higher for students than for
   instructors. Instructors were found to have higher perceptions of
   social norms and higher perceptions of facilitating conditions than
   students. However, there was no difference between the instructors and
   students in level of utilization of the VLE. Students perceived that
   the VLE had higher impacts on their learning compared with instructors'
   perceptions regarding their teaching. These results suggest that
   despite high levels of support acknowledged by instructors, they may
   still be unsure about the contribution of VLEs to their teaching.

DE adaptation; communicative acts; computer-mediated communication;
   personalization; sentence openers; structured dialogue
AB In this paper, we present a synchronous text-based communication tool,
   referred to as Adaptive Communication Tool (ACT), which provides
   capabilities for adaptation and personalization. ACT supports both the
   free and the structured form of dialogue. The structured dialogue is
   implemented by two types of Scaffolding Sentence Templates (SST); i.e.
   sentence openers or communicative acts. The capability of adaptation is
   considered in the sense of making suggestions for the supported form of
   dialogue and SST type and providing the most meaningful and complete
   set of SST with respect to the learning outcomes addressed by the
   collaborative learning activity and the model of collaboration followed
   by the group members. Also, ACT enables learners to have control on the
   adaptation by selecting the form of dialogue and the SST type they
   prefer to use and enriching the provided SST set with their own ones in
   order to cover their communication needs. The results from the
   formative evaluation of the tool showed that (i) the proposed dialogue
   form, SST type and the provided set of SST cover students'
   communication needs, (ii) the capability of personalizing the
   communication by selecting the desired communication means as well as
   by enriching the provided SST set satisfied students, and (iii)
   students used adequately both types of SST resulting into on-task and
   coherent dialogues.

DE assessment tool; deep learning; peer assessment; programming language;

AB Active learning is considered by many academics as an important and
   effective learning strategy. Assessment is integrated in learning as a
   tool for learning, but traditional assessment methods often encourage
   surface learning (passive learning) rather than deep learning (active
   learning). Peer assessment is a method of motivating students,
   involving students discussing, marking and providing feedback on other
   students' work, and is one of the successful approaches which can be
   used to enhance deep learning. Students are required to think
   critically about what they are learning during the peer assessment
   process. Tutors' marking is usually accepted as reliable, but student
   peers' marking in a peer assessment process is suspect. As part of a
   study investigating whether peer assessment can be an accurate
   assessment method in a computer programming course, a novel web-based
   peer assessment tool has been developed. In this paper, we describe the
   tool and report the results of evaluating the tool through experiments
   involving large programming classes. The results suggest that
   computer-mediated peer assessment is a valuable assessment approach
   which promotes active learning and is an accurate assessment method in
   a programming course.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the nature of tutor and
   student online communication and collaboration activities in a blended
   learning course. The hypothesis that these activities are related to
   student learning performance (exam results) was tested based on the
   number of messages posted, as well as the nature of these messages
   (type of content transmitted in terms of course content-related,
   interpersonal and organizational activities). Descriptive results show
   that tutors were mainly involved in organizational tasks, whereas
   students communicated mostly at content-related and interpersonal
   levels. Student performance was not related to the quantity of tutors'
   activity, but to the quantity of students' activity. Closer examination
   of the nature of different activities showed that not only tutors'
   interpersonal, but also students' own content-related and interpersonal
   messages had an impact on students' learning performance. This study
   raises the possibility that the nature of messages is more important
   than their quantity. It calls into question former research, which has
   indicated the importance of the amount of activity while mostly
   neglecting to discriminate between the differences in nature of
   activities and which has based its findings almost entirely on
   subjective ratings for both activities and performance. Implications
   for evaluation of activities and design of personal support are
   discussed.

AB A field experiment compares the effectiveness and satisfaction
   associated with technology-assisted learning with that of face-to-face
   learning. The empirical evidence suggests that technology-assisted
   learning effectiveness depends on the target knowledge category.
   Building on Kolb's experiential learning model, we show that
   technology-assisted learning improves students' acquisition of
   knowledge that demands abstract conceptualization and reflective
   observation but adversely affects their ability to obtain knowledge
   that requires concrete experience. Technology-assisted learning better
   supports vocabulary learning than face-to-face learning but is
   comparatively less effective in developing listening comprehension
   skills. In addition, according to empirical tests, perceived ease of
   learning and learning community support significantly predict both
   perceived learning effectiveness and learning satisfaction. Overall,
   the results support our hypotheses and research model and suggest
   instructors should consider the target knowledge when considering
   technology-assisted learning options or designing a Web-based course.
   In addition, a supportive learning community can make
   technology-assisted learning easier for students and increase their
   learning satisfaction.

AB Many would agree that learning on the Web - a highly autonomous
   learning environment - may be difficult for individuals who lack
   motivation and self-regulated learning skills. Using a social cognitive
   view of academic motivation and self-regulation, the objective of the
   present study was to investigate the relations between students'
   motivational beliefs, their perceptions of the learning environment and
   their satisfaction with a self-paced, online course. Service academy
   undergraduates (n = 646) completed a questionnaire following online
   training. Pearson correlations indicate that task value, self-efficacy
   and perceived instructional quality were significantly positively
   related to each other and to students' overall satisfaction with the
   self-paced, online course. Additionally, results from a three-step
   hierarchical regression reveal that task value, self-efficacy and
   instructional quality were significant positive predictors of students'
   satisfaction; the final regression model accounted for approximately
   54% of the variance in the outcome measure. These findings support and
   extend prior research in traditional classrooms and online education in
   university settings, indicating that military students' motivational
   beliefs about a learning task and their perceptions of instructional
   quality are related, in important ways, to their overall satisfaction
   with online instruction. Educational implications and suggestions for
   future research are discussed.

AB This research explores the process of asynchronous
   problem-solving-based discussion activities and aims to understand
   limitations likely to arise during learners' problem-solving
   discussions. The research has combined lag-sequential analysis and
   quantitative content analysis, and expects to use such analyzing
   methods to further understand the sequential pattern of students'
   problem-solving discussion behaviors and knowledge-construction levels.
   In order to avoid influence caused by teachers' subjective guiding
   methods and ensure objective observations, we observed learners' online
   problem-solving discussions without intervention or guidance from the
   teachers. From the sequential pattern derived, we have not only induced
   a pattern of students' discussion behavior but also discovered that,
   compared to discussion activity based on a single topic appointed by
   the teacher, the problem-solving online discussion activity is more
   helpful for students' knowledge construction. In addition, this
   research also revealed certain limitations toward the content and
   behavior of students' discussion without teachers' guidance. Based on
   the results, this paper proposes a strategy in which teachers can
   intervene and guide, which is expected to enhance the depth of
   students' discussion and knowledge construction when a teacher is
   applying a problem-based learning activity.

AB Students in network-based learning environments may have their own
   learning paths based on either their learning results or status. The
   learning system can choose suitable learning materials for individual
   students depending on students' learning results. There is a lot of
   research about learning diagnosis in distance education, and the main
   objective is to improve students' learning effects. This research
   proposes a full-loop learning architecture based on a knowledge map and
   provides feedback about teaching materials suitable for students. First
   of all, the learning system diagnoses and identifies the misconceptions
   of students by using a knowledge map; second, it selects suitable
   learning materials according to misconceptions and arranges a learning
   path for individual students to do remedial learning. This research
   uses precision, recall, and F-measure to measure the feedback effects.
   The results of the experiment show that the learning materials and
   learning paths suggested by the system are good. The contributions of
   this research are as follows: improving the diagnosis method; giving
   suitable learning materials and learning paths for remedy learning;
   and, moreover, improving the learning effects of students.

AB A web-based peer assessment system using video streaming technology was
   implemented to support the training of pre-service teachers. The peer
   assessment process was synchronized with viewing of peer teaching
   videos so that comments could be linked to the relevant position on the
   video. When one viewed a comment, the associated video segment could
   then be played, which allowed pre-service teachers to understand more
   precisely the nature of a reviewer's comment. Thirty-six pre-service
   computer teachers, who were enrolled in a teaching practicum course,
   participated in the study. Five rounds of peer assessment were
   conducted during pre-service teachers' micro- and field-teaching
   sessions. The findings showed that pre-service teachers were satisfied
   with the peer assessment activities and perceived the streaming video
   as a useful feature. The video streaming feature also played an
   important role during pre-service teachers' web-based dialogues, but
   was not as significant in terms of how they commented on or replied to
   peers. We provide some suggestions for improved use of this technique
   in the conclusion of our paper.

DE 3D virtual reality; situated language learning; goal-based scenario;
   strategic interaction; VEC3D
AB A 3D virtually synchronous communication architecture for situated
   language learning has been designed to foster communicative competence
   among undergraduate students who have studied English as a foreign
   language (EFL). We present an innovative approach that offers better
   e-learning than the previous virtual reality educational applications.
   The proposed method supplies learners with autonomy in virtual
   communications, allowing learners to achieve a variety of shared goals.
   The traditional text-based or web-based virtual reality systems are
   generally less attractive to students because of their lack of 3D
   immersion and real-time voice interaction. Three-D virtual reality
   technology can be exploited to compensate these weaknesses. We propose
   an immersive and interactive virtual English classroom, entitled VEC3D,
   that integrates a goal-based instructional design, vivid 3D graphics,
   and real-time voice communication. The ultimate goal of the VEC3D
   project is to enhance learners' English communicative competence. This
   research determines how learners perceive their experiences in the
   virtual space and use communication strategies (CSs) in the process of
   advancing communicative competence. The recent ethnographic study
   results revealed that the proposed application promoted positive
   student attitude and interactive learning experiences.

AB There are a number of measurement instruments in the field of education
   whose aims are to measure various aspects of educational technology.
   However, the psychometric properties of such instruments are not always
   determined, and their use is not always appropriate. The aim of this
   study was to determine the psychometric properties of the survey of
   factors affecting teachers teaching with technology (SFA-T-3) when used
   with a sample of Greek Cypriot teachers. The results of this study show
   that the reliability evidence obtained from the responses to the
   questionnaire was satisfactory. The construct validity evidence was
   also determined based on a factor analysis that created ten easily
   interpretable factors. Some gender differences have also appeared in
   the teachers' responses on the various factors, which is in accordance
   with similar literature that exists in other countries as well.

AB This paper discusses the communicative potentials of Computerized
   Adaptive Testing. The study is based on a model that offers a set of
   independent communicative concepts to describe the Genre of an
   interactive application. This model will be the starting point to
   analyze the stages of the interaction cycle that are typically inherent
   to every generator of computerized adaptive tests. In each of these
   stages, the authors present the most appropriate communication
   structures that should support the intentions of the developers of this
   kind of software. The paper finishes giving a synthesis of the
   interactive potential of these communication stages from a Genre
   perspective, and discussing the compatibility between the proposed
   approach and some model-based methods that are currently used during
   the design of interactive applications.

AB Nowadays, a wide range of initiatives are focused on providing
   solutions relating to the integration and reuse of different types of
   learning objects. This paper deals with the assembly of learning
   objects, one of the most difficult components for reuse. Our proposal
   takes into account the requirements and competencies defined for each
   learning object in order to allow them to be assembled in a coherent
   way. As a result of this approach, we have developed ELO-Tool, a web
   application that implements an assembly mechanism based on a semantic
   comparison of requirements and competencies through the use of
   ontologies. Moreover, the application generates the appropriate set of
   meta-data to describe the new learning objects resulting from the
   assembly process.

   largest detriment to its use is the intimidating nature of VR
   technology for nontechnical instructors. What are the challenges to
   using VR technology for the design and development of VR-based

   paper addresses the issues regarding identifying the appropriate
   techniques for integrating VR into traditional instructional design,
   and the considerations for development for non-technical educators.
   Recommendations are grounded within our own project involving virtual

AB This study investigates preservice teachers' trust levels and
   collaborative communication behaviors namely leadership, feedback,
   social interaction, enthusiasm, task and technical uncertainties, and
   task-oriented interactions in online learning environment. A case study
   design involving qualitative and quantitative data collection and
   analysis was employed. The sample consisted of 32 (24 female, 8 male)
   3rd year foreign language education students who enrolled in the
   "Instructional Technology and Material Development" course at Middle
   East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey. The participants were
   involved in a four-month online project in the 'Learning to Teach with
   Technology Studio' (LTTS) course at Indiana University in the US to
   create a technology supported project-based learning unit for foreign
   language learners. At the end of the fourteen-week period, the
   participants filled out the online Group Trust Questionnaire consisting
   eight five-point Likert-type items and two open-ended questions. To
   identify the participants' online interactions, online discussion
   archives of the groups were analyzed. The findings showed that the
   groups with different trust levels showed different communication
   behaviors throughout the study, and midpoint of the group life was
   found critical moment for increasing or decreasing pattern of
   communication behaviors.

AB Cooperative learning is known to be an effective educational strategy
   in enhancing the learning performance of students. The goal of a
   cooperative learning group is to maximize all members' learning
   efficacy. This is accomplished via promoting each other's success,
   through assisting, sharing, mentoring, explaining, and encouragement.
   To achieve the goal of cooperative learning, it is very important to
   organize well-structured cooperative learning groups. In this study, an
   enhanced genetic algorithm is proposed to organize cooperative learning
   groups to meet multiple grouping criteria. To show the usefulness of
   the algorithm, this study presents a case that, for a given course, the
   teacher sets the criteria of grouping that each concept of a certain
   course topic is precisely understood by at least one of the peer
   students in each group, and the average learning achievement of each
   group is approximately identical. Based on our enhanced genetic
   algorithm, an assistant system for organizing cooperative learning
   groups has been developed. Experimental results have shown that the
   enhanced approach is able to efficiently organize cooperative learning
   groups that more fit the instructional objectives set by the instructor.

SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY

DE e-learning; e-readiness; e-maturity; warehouse workers; digital divide;
   technophobia
AB Modern organizations use technology to expand across traditional
   business zones and boundaries to survive the global commercial village.
   While IT systems allow organizations to maintain a competitive edge,
   South African unskilled labour performing warehouse operations are
   frequently retrained to keep abreast with Information Technology.
   Organizations require training solutions less costly than standard
   classroom training, and many companies look towards e-learning as an
   alternative training solution. We questioned whether warehouse workers
   representative of many developing African communities demonstrate the
   cultural habits, skills, aptitude and motivation for complex learning
   strategies such as e-learning. While exploring the e-readiness of
   warehouse workers, we compared Reeves' e-readiness indexes to the rise
   and fall of a barometer. During a three-phased qualitative study,
   twenty e-readiness conceptual codes emerged. We found that warehouse
   workers that regularly encounter computer technology do not suffer
   technophobia. Encounters with computers positively affect their
   training preferences and heighten their receptiveness for e-learning.
   The culture organization holds the key to the e-readiness of the
   warehouse workers via access, finances and time allocated for training.
   The viability of e-learning depends on the organization's e-maturity
   and guidance to transform the warehouse workers into self-driven
   trainees.

AB The rapid growth in the use of learning technologies, particularly the
   use of the web based technologies and communications have offered
   educators with many more opportunities to investigate the most suitable
   learning environments for their students' learning styles. The purpose
   of the present study was to examine the students' learning styles and
   their views on blended learning. The study was conducted with
   thirty-four students at Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey. The two
   instruments were the questionnaire designed to identify students' views
   on blended learning and Kolb's Learning Style Inventory (LSI) to
   measure students' learning styles. Additional data were gathered from
   achievement scores of students; and records demonstrate students'
   participation to e - learning environment. Results revealed that
   students' views on blended learning process, such as ease of use of the
   web environment, evaluation, face to face environment etc., differ
   according to their learning styles. Results also revealed that the
   highest mean score corresponds to face to face aspect of the process
   when students' evaluation concerning the implementation is taken to
   consideration. The overall findings showed no significant differences
   between students' achievement level according to their learning styles.

AB This document is a survey in the research area of User Modeling (UM)
   for the specific field of Adaptive Learning. The aims of this document
   are: To define what it is a User Model; To present existing and well
   known User Models; To analyze the existent standards related with UM;
   To compare existing systems. In the scientific area of User Modeling
   (UM), numerous research and developed systems already seem to promise
   good results, but some experimentation and implementation are still
   necessary to conclude about the utility of the UM. That is, the
   experimentation and implementation of these systems are still very
   scarce to determine the utility of some of the referred applications.
   At present, the Student Modeling research goes in the direction to make
   possible reuse a student model in different systems. The standards are
   more and more relevant for this effect, allowing systems communicate
   and to share data, components and structures, at syntax and semantic
   level, even if most of them still only allow syntax integration.

AB The reasons that the current tutorial system (CTS) does not produce
   significant effects include the budgets and policies of schools, the
   greater independence of students, and the infrequent interaction of
   tutors with students. To reduce the deficiencies of the current
   tutorial system, this paper proposes a network tutorial system (NTS)
   and discusses the feasibility of the NTS. We use factor analysis to
   find the emphasized key factors of tutors, the counselors of student
   counseling centers (abbreviated as counselors), and students,
   respectively, about the feasibility of the NTS. Also, we use t test to
   check whether the mean opinion of male students and that of female
   students have significant difference with respect to each evaluation
   item of the feasibility of the NTS. Taiwanese universities and colleges
   are used as the research subjects. The empirical results show that the
   most emphasized factor of the tutors and students is "privacy esteem."
   The most emphasized factor of the counselors is "the efficiency
   enhancement of counseling due to the NTS." The gender differences of
   students do not influence the evaluation results of them for the
   feasibility of the NTS.

AB This study was conducted to explore the relationship between Internet
   self-efficacy and preferences toward constructivist Internet-based
   learning environments. The sample included 365 college students in
   Taiwan who all majored in early childhood care and pre-school
   education. Some of them were preservice pre-school teachers (n= 185),
   and the rest of them were inservice pre-school teachers who pursued a
   degree for childhood care (n= 180). Through analyzing student
   questionnaire responses, the findings revealed that general Internet
   self-efficacy might foster the preferences of constructivist
   Internet-based learning environments. In other words, when widely
   implementing constructivist Internet-based learning environments, a
   prerequisite may be the condition that the learners should have
   adequate general Internet self-efficacy. By using structural equation
   model (SEM), this study further investigated the causal relations among
   the variables considered in this study. The SEM analysis showed that
   students with higher general Internet self-efficacy clearly showed more
   preferences toward Internet learning environments where they can use
   with ease, explore real-life problems, display multiple sources of
   information, conduct open-ended inquiry learning activities, and
   elaborate the nature of knowledge. However, students with higher
   communicative Internet self-efficacy tended to display relatively less
   preferences for inquiry learning on the Internet.

ID EDUCATION
AB This paper draws on the literature of transformational leadership and
   learning organisation with a concern to foster innovative changes in
   classroom practices. Based on the understanding that effective use of
   ICT has to be construed in the pedagogical and organisational context,
   this study focuses on the impact of the relevant contextual factors on
   teaching and learning, and how these factors interact with each other,
   in particular the relationship between technological innovations and
   pedagogical innovations. By adopting a qualitative case study approach
   to examining the impetus for change, four different types of ICT
   implementation strategies have emerged from a sample of eight schools
   in Hong Kong and Singapore, the technologically driven type, the
   pedagogically driven type, the balanced type, and the uncoupled type.
   Those schools which have realized changes in classroom practices are
   characterised by ICT-pedagogical innovations. To make this happen,
   pedagogical innovations must be rooted in teachers' experiences of
   moving away from a teacher-centred approach to one that is more
   student-centred. Leadership and the climate for collaboration and
   experimentation are fundamental to the integration of technology into
   pedagogical innovations. However, other factors such as region, school
   level, and type of school do not seem to account for the differences.

AB This paper investigates factors affecting the perceived readiness for
   online collaborative learning (OCL) of a sample of 86 mathematics
   teachers from 12 secondary schools. Descriptive analysis, factor
   analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and structure equation modeling
   were used to analyze the data. A moderately fit model was generated and
   able to inform that time constraint and insufficient access to
   technology such as computer and the Internet were confirmed to be the
   two impediments to OCL as perceived by the teachers. Besides, a new
   factor emerged, namely the factor of new learning paradigm, has shown
   positive impact on the teachers' perceived readiness for OCL. A
   majority of them agreed that school principal, training and guidance on
   OCL play an important role to support the implementation of this novice
   approach in schools.

AB With the increasing use of dynamic media in multimedia learning
   material, it is important to consider not only the technological but
   also the cognitive aspects of its application. A large amount of
   previous research does not provide preference to either static or
   dynamic media for educational purposes and a considerable number of
   studies found positive, negative or even no effects of dynamic media on
   learning performance. Consequently, it is still necessary to discern
   which factors contribute to the success or failure of static or dynamic
   media. The study presented here can be seen as another brick in the
   wall of understanding students' learning supported by dynamic media. In
   this study, aspects of cognitive load and the ability to generate
   mental representations for the purpose of appropriate animation design
   and development are considered. The learning performance of static
   versus dynamic media amongst a total of 129 Computer Science students,
   including a control group, was investigated. The results showed that
   learning performance using dynamic media was significantly higher than
   those of the static textbook lesson when the learning material had a
   certain level of complexity; the more complex the learning material,
   the larger the benefit of using animations. The results were examined
   for possible factors that contributed to the success or failure of
   dynamic media in education. In conclusion, this study has successfully
   confirmed the theory that dynamic media can support learning when
   cognitive load and learners' mental representations are taken into
   account during the design and development of learning material
   containing dynamic media.

AB While researchers have studied the use and value of educational
   software for many years, study of school Web sites and/or their
   effectiveness is limited. In this investigation, we identified goals
   and functions of school Web sites and used the foundations of effective
   Web site design to develop an evaluation checklist. We then applied
   these criteria to a random sample of Web sites to identify the extent
   to which the key features were evident in them. The majority of the
   elementary school Web sites surveyed provided evidence of basic design
   principles; however, scores were not as good for structure, design,
   general components, and general ratings. Based on our findings, we
   derived and present a set of guidelines for developing and improving
   elementary school Web sites. We also suggest that future research
   efforts should examine contextual factors influencing the effectiveness
   of elementary school Web sites and how various stakeholders use
   elementary school Web sites.

AB Virtual teams enabled by information and communications technologies
   (ICT) are increasingly being adopted not only by for-profit
   organizations but also by education institutions as well. This study
   investigates what contributes to the success of virtual learning teams.
   Specifically, we examine the issue of leadership in virtual learning
   teams. The study first reviews the current literature on teams,
   leadership, and trust then proposes a framework of team effectiveness
   of virtual learning teams. A field study is conducted to investigate
   the influence of several independent variables including diversified
   leadership roles, leadership effectiveness, team trust, and propensity
   to trust. It is found that diversified leadership roles influences both
   leadership effectiveness and team trust; both leadership effectiveness
   and propensity to trust influence team trust, and team trust in turn
   directly impacts team effectiveness. In addition, team trust mediates
   the relationship between leadership effectiveness and team
   effectiveness. Some practical implications of the results are discussed
   as well.

AB The goal of this study was to explore whether differences in student
   academic indicators exist between taking a course face-to-face (F2F)
   and taking a course via distance education (DE). Three hundred and
   eighty five students were enrolled in a course offered, both, as F2F (n
   = 116) and as DE (n = 269). Course content, instructor, textbook
   adopted, and assessment methods were consistent between the two course
   delivery formats. Final grades, DFW rates, and end of term course and
   instructor evaluations were used as the outcome indicators. In
   addition, student demographic information was factored into data
   analyses. Results indicated that there was a statistically significant
   difference in final grade, DFW rates, and end of term course evaluation
   response rates between the course offerings. Further analysis suggested
   that freshman grade performance was significantly different between
   course offerings. Implications and policy suggestions regarding
   distance education will be discussed.

ID CLASSROOM
AB This paper examines the framings that the fields of the social studies
   of science and science education use for each other. It is shown that
   the social studies of science frames science education as passive and
   timeless. Science education frames science studies as a set of
   representations to better capture how science works. The paper then
   proceeds to sketch an alternative in which schools are understood,
   drawing on actor-network theory and cultural studies of science, as
   constituted through contesting scientific practices and discourses and,
   therefore, are proper objects of study within science studies
   frameworks. The curricular implications are briefly developed,
   emphasizing the need for much more reflection upon and activism within
   science education regarding the technoscientific constitution of
   students and schools. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This article explores the relation between how scientific knowledge is
   created and the reasoning involved in learning content with
   understanding. Although an asserted parallel between these underpins
   reform, little is actually known about this relation. This article
   offers a model of this relation that draws coherent connections between
   the science studies literature, which suggests ways of conceiving how
   scientific knowledge is created; and sociocultural learning theory,
   which suggests ways of conceiving scientific reasoning. This model
   highlights a dialectic between construction and critique of claims in
   both scientific reasoning and practice. A "grasp" of scientific
   practice as such is instrumental to learning because informational
   content of scientific knowledge lies not only on the level of facts,
   but also on the levels of methods and values, and coordinating
   information across these levels is crucial for understanding. In
   contrast to prevailing constructivist ideas that highlight student
   authority to construct knowledge as scientists do, this model
   emphasizes the importance of knowing how to hold claims accountable.
   Thus, the ideal vision of students making their own sense of content is
   superceded by a more defensible ideal vision of students learning how
   to make scientific sense of content. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

SO SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID WORK
AB Models and modeling are a major issue in science studies and in science
   education. In addressing such an issue, we first propose an
   epistemological discussion based on the works of Cartwright (1983,
   1999), Fleck (1935/1979), and Hacking (1983). This leads us to
   emphasize the transitions between the abstract and the concrete in the
   modeling process, by using the notions of nomogical machine
   (Cartwright, 1999), language game (Wittgenstein, 1953/1997), and
   thought style (Fleck, 1935/1979). Then, in the light of our
   epistemological approach, we study four cases coming from the
   implementations of research-based design activities (SESAMES, 2007).
   These four case studies illustrate how students are engaged in
   constructing relations between the abstract and the concrete through
   modeling activities, by elaborating at the same time specific language
   games and appropriate thought styles. Finally, we draw some
   implications for science teaching. It is suggested that considering
   didactic nomological machines as embedding knowledge on the one hand,
   and classes as thought collectives, on the other hand, may relevantly
   contribute to science education and science education research. (c)

AB Theoretical and empirical research on argument and argumentation in
   science education has intensified over the last two decades. The term
   "argument" in this review refers to the artifacts that a student or a
   group of students create when asked to articulate and justify claims or
   explanations whereas the term "argumentation" refers to the process of
   constructing these artifacts. The intent of this review is to provide
   an overview of several analytic frameworks that science educators use
   to assess and characterize the nature of or quality of scientific
   arguments in terms of three focal issues: structure, justification, and
   content. To highlight the foci, affordances, and constraints of these
   different analytic methods, the review of each framework includes an
   analysis of a sample argument. The review concludes with a synthesis of
   the three focal issues and outlines several recommendations for future
   work. Ultimately, this examination and synthesis of these frameworks in
   terms of how each conceptualizes argument structure, justification, and
   content is intended to provide a theoretical foundation for future
   research on argument in science education. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals,

TI Conceptualizations of argumentation from science studies and the

SO SCIENCE EDUCATION

DT Article
ID SCHOOL SCIENCE; DISCOURSE; THINKING; MODELS
AB Argumentation has become an increasingly recognized focus for science
   instruction-as a learning process, as an outcome associated with the
   appropriation of scientific discourse, and as a window onto the
   epistemic work of science. Only a small set of theoretical
   conceptualizations of argumentation have been deployed and investigated
   in science education, however, while a plethora of conceptualizations
   have been developed in the interdisciplinary fields associated with
   science studies and the learning sciences. This paper attempts to
   review a range of such theoretical conceptualizations of argumentation
   and discuss the possible implications for the orchestration of science
   education; the goal being that the science education research community
   might consider a broader range of argumentation forms and roles in
   conjunction with the learning of science. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals,

AB Science education reform has long focused on assessing student inquiry,
   and there has been progress in developing tools specifically with
   respect to experimentation and argumentation. We suggest the need for
   attention to another aspect of inquiry, namely mechanistic reasoning.
   Scientific inquiry focuses largely on understanding causal mechanisms
   that underlie natural phenomena. We have adapted an account of
   mechanism from philosophy of science studies in professional science
   [Machamer, P., Darden, D., & Craver, C. F., (2000). Thinking about
   mechanisms. Philosophy of Science, 67, 1-25] to develop a framework for
   discourse analysis that aids in identifying and analyzing students'
   mechanistic reasoning. We analyze a discussion among first-grade
   students about falling objects (1) to illustrate the generativity of
   the framework, (2) to demonstrate that mechanistic reasoning is
   abundantly present even in these young students, and (3) to show that
   mechanistic reasoning is episodic in their discourse. (c) 2008 Wiley

DT Article
AB We often knowingly teach false science. Such a practice conflicts with
   a prima facie pedagogical value placed on teaching only what is true. I
   argue that only a partial dissolution of the conflict is possible: the
   proper aim of instruction in science is not to provide an armory of
   facts about what things the world contains, how they interact, and so
   on, but rather to contribute to an understanding of how science as a
   human endeavor works and what sorts of facts about the world science
   aims to provide. Such an aim legislates for an increased prominence of
   history and philosophy in even secondary science education. (c) 2008

AB The present article scrutinizes the manner with which a group of three
   postsecondary students (in Quebec, Canada) describe the social actors
   concerned by the controversy surrounding cellular telephones. The study
   was conducted on the basis of an ethnographic approach. Participant
   observation was performed by the researcher for 3 hours during each of
   15 weeks. The theoretical framework developed by Callon, Lascournes,
   and Barthe (2001) was drawn on to show how the group assigns roles
   relating to public representation and the production of legitimate
   knowledges; in particular, it assigns to scientists the role of
   conducting research; to government the roles of building citizens'
   awareness about the risks related to cellular telephone use, protecting
   users, and guiding the conduct of the cellular telephone industry; and
   to citizens the roles of becoming/staying informed and of making
   limited use of cellular telephones. The study reported here also
   illustrates that, in the process, the group airs their views concerning
   the terms best suited to defining the subject of the controversy,
   constituting research "collectives," and disseminating knowledge. One
   main conclusion is that science education research projects drawing on
   the contributions of Callon et al. (2001) hold out considerable promise
   in terms of relevance and fruitfulness. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Our research project was guided by the assumption that students who

   scientific language will develop improved understanding of new

   everyday understanding of phenomena to the use of scientific language.
   This study involved 49 minority students who were randomly assigned
   into two groups for analysis: a treatment group (taught with everyday
   language prior to using scientific language) and a control group
   (taught with scientific language). Using a pre-post-test control group
   design, we assessed students' conceptual and linguistic understanding
   of photosynthesis. The results of this study indicated that students
   taught with the "content-first" approach developed significantly
   impimproved understanding when compared to students taught in
   traditional ways. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals.

AB This article reports a study on using data mining to predict K-12
   students' competence levels on test items related to energy. Data
   sources are the 1995 Third International Mathematics and Science Study
   (TIMSS), 1999 TIMSS-Repeat, 2003 Trend in International Mathematics and
   Science Study (TIMSS), and the National Assessment of Educational
   Progress (NAEP). Student population performances, that is, percentages
   correct, are the object of prediction. Two data mining algorithms, C4.5
   and M5, are used to construct a decision tree and a linear function to
   predict students' performance levels. A combination of factors related
   to content, context, and cognitive demand of items and to students'
   grade levels are found to predict student population per-formances on
   test items. Cognitive demands have the most significant contribution to
   the prediction. The decision tree and linear function agree with each
   other on predictions. We end the article by discussing implications of
   findings for future science content standard development and energy
   concept teaching. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals.

AB This study is a meta-interpretative analysis that focuses on research
   conducted and published by other researchers. Concepts central to this
   study include global practical relevance, curriculum design, and
   formative situation. We analyzed 35 studies selected from 374 published
   studies in the years 2000 and 2001 in three journals referenced in the
   International Scientific Index. Using a replicable methodology
   developed specifically for this research, we found evidence of s
   clusters of variables that suggest the existence of transversal traits
   in the 35 science education research studies. These results form a
   reference framework of theoretical and practical knowledge relevant for
   research and practice pertaining to teaching and learning science. (c)

ID FIT
AB The central purposes of this study were to review the development and
   evolution of the Scientific Attitude Inventory (SAI) and then
   reevaluate the psychometric properties of the revised form of the SAI,
   the Scientific Attitude Inventory H (SAI-II). The SAI-II was
   administered to a convenience sample of 543 middle and high school
   students from five teachers in four schools in four school districts in
   San Antonio, Texas, at the beginning of the 2004-2005 school year.
   Confirmatory factor analysis on the full data set failed to support the
   existence of a 12-factor structure (as proposed by the scale
   developers) or a one-factor structure. The data were then randomly
   divided into exploratory [exploratory factor analysis (EFA)l validation
   and confirmatory [confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)] cross-validation
   sets. Exploratory and confirmatory models yielded a three-factor
   solution that did not fit the data well [chi(2) (32 1) = 646, p <.001;
   RMSEA =.061 (.90 CI =.054-.068); and CFI =.81]. The three factors were
   labeled "Science is About Understanding and Explaining" (13 items),
   "Science is Rigid" (6 items), and "I Want to Be a Scientist" (8 items).
   The a-coefficients for these three factors ranged from 0.59 to 0.85.
   Whether these identified subscales are valid will require independent
   investigation. In this sample, and consistent with prior publications,
   the SAI-II in its current form did not have satisfactory psychometric
   properties and cannot be recommended for further use. (c) 2008 Wiley

   emergence of a new economic and sociopolitical contract between
   science, the nation, state, and private commercial interests. Generally
   regarded as having been precipitated by globalization, these changes in
   the sciences are beginning to be documented by a range of commentators.
   Clearly, science's changing forms hold profound implications for the
   development of science education. As there is little science education
   scholarship exploring the implications sciences' altering forms, this
   paper attempts to investigate the relationship at more depth. Detailing
   this relationship is important because it can help formulate new
   questions, and methods for their investigation, relevant to the work of
   science education in the newly global world. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals.

AB This study examines cognitive and social processes in group
   interactions that shape collaborative learning in science classrooms.
   Three small groups of students were observed while working
   collaboratively on explaining the burning of a candle under a jar. The
   learning environment served as a context for examination of conceptual
   convergence, a process wherein students construct shared meanings for
   science concepts through gradual refinement of ambiguous, partial
   meanings presented in group space. Despite engaging in the same
   activity with very similar instructional supports, the groups displayed
   very different patterns of interaction and achieved varied degrees of
   conceptual convergence. One group collaborated effectively and
   displayed evidence of individual conceptualizations of science content
   converging to establish a more well-informed shared conceptualization.
   The other groups were not as successful, each for unique reasons.
   Problems demonstrated in one group included lack of self-confidence,
   poor monitoring of group learning, and active avoidance of potentially
   fruitful conceptual conflicts. The other group struggled primarily
   because of a combative social context. The major educational
   significance of this study was the identification of social context and
   interactive patterns, group approaches to conceptual conflicts, and
   instructors' roles in collaborative activities as crucial aspects of
   productive group learning. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals.

   within one pedagogical context
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Following the establishment of Centres for Excellence in Teaching and
   Learning in England and Northern Ireland in 2005, several institutions
   have used these to pursue specific pedagogical approaches at a
   strategic level, in line with and building on existing institutional
   strategic thinking. Technology-enhanced learning is often one of the
   vehicles to implement these pedagogical approaches, leading to
   institution-wide attempts to identify and support suitable
   technologies. This paper discusses the role of the educational
   developer in this process and what impact this particular role might
   have at strategic level, bearing in mind the numerous simultaneous
   developments that take place in an institution at any one time.

TI Developing communities of practice within and outside higher education
   institutions
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID TECHNOLOGY; CHALLENGES
AB Higher education institutions (HEIs) are largely built on the
   assumption that learning is an individual process best encouraged by
   explicit teaching that is, on the whole, separated from social
   engagement with those outside the university community. This
   perspective has been theoretically challenged by those who argue for a
   social constructivist learning theory and a more collaborative approach
   to learning. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) afford
   lecturers and students an opportunity for extending the boundaries of a
   learning experience, not merely beyond the lone individual, but beyond
   the limits of discipline boundaries within a specific university
   community and beyond the institution into the local community. This
   paper illustrates how a collaborative effort between lecturers and
   students from the Computer Science and Education Departments at Rhodes
   University, teachers from the local community, the provincial
   Department of Education and a non-governmental organisation developed
   into an unfolding virtual and physical community of practice which
   enabled ICT take-up in a number of schools in the Grahamstown District,
   South Africa. This discussion of what has become known as the e-Yethu
   project provides an example of how ICTs, underpinned by the insights of
   social constructivism, the notion of 'community of practice' and in
   particular Hoadley and Kilner's C4P Framework for Communities of
   Practice, can serve to help HEIs understand ways in which ICTs can
   provide opportunities for developing collaborative learning within
   HEIs, and between the HEI and the local community.

TI e-university: a cross-case study in four Italian universities
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes the aims, the methods, the stages and the results
   of the research project 'e-University. Information and communication
   technologies (ICTs) as a factor of change in Italian universities',
   undertaken between 2003 and 2006 by the Universities of Trento, Perugia
   and Sassari and the Catholic University of Milan.
   The characteristics of the four institutions' subjects and objects of
   the investigation are analysed as case studies and then compared as a
   cross-case study in the light of the factors that we feel constitute
   the main areas of concern in the four institutions as to the
   implementation of ICTs in the teaching/learning process, ie, the
   characteristics of the governance strategic plan, the choices relating
   to technology and the choices related to pedagogy. The paper describes
   the collaborative effort characterising the community of researchers
   through the different stages of the research. It also analyses how the
   individual features of each university-relating to its history, the
   number of students, the range of faculties, the diffusion of
   e-learning, the driving factors for innovation, the institution's
   policies-have fostered a lively and fruitful discussion between
   different view points, thus engendering deeper reflections for each
   context.

TI Rules, roles and tools: Activity theory and the comparative study of
   e-learning
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Activity theory (AT) is a powerful tool for investigating 'artefacts in
   use', ie, the ways technologies interrelate with their local context.
   AT reveals the interfaces between e-learning at the macro- (strategy,
   policy, 'campus-wide' solutions) and the micro-organisational levels
   (everyday working practice, iterative change, individual adaptation).
   In AT, contexts are conceived of as activity systems in which human,
   technological and organisational elements are interrelated and largely
   inseparable. Both the subjects of the activity system (internal) and
   the wider community (external) mediate their activities through tools,
   rules and roles. This paper shows how a course management system (CMS)
   exerts an influence over all three of these mediators, though the exact
   nature of this influence depends on the particular configuration of
   each activity system. This is illustrated with reference to two case
   study programmes, both of which used Moodle as their CMS, but which had
   activity systems structured in quite different ways; the programmes
   also had different relationships with their external organisational
   environment.

TI The videoconferencing learning environment: Technology, interaction and
   learning intersect
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper is a study on the interaction patterns of distance learners
   enrolled in the Mathematics and Physics programmes of Universiti Sains
   Malaysia in the videoconferencing learning environment (VCLE).
   Interaction patterns are analysed in six randomly chosen
   videoconferencing sessions within one academic year. The findings show
   there are more interactions in the graphics display mode than the video
   display mode. The graphics display mode, which involves the
   simultaneous interaction of the teacher, students and course materials,
   shows greater student engagement in the VCLE. The focus on a
   three-component interaction in distance learning differs from previous
   studies which looked at distinct types of two-component interactions.
   The types of communicative interaction, in particular the explanatory
   and cognitive types which are dominant in the graphics display mode,
   are discussed within the construct of learning. The higher number of
   teacher-initiated interactions may also imply that the teacher plays a
   crucial role in creating and maintaining a community of inquiry focused
   on exploring and developing content as well as giving feedback on
   concepts, ideas or solutions.

TI Students' response to traditional and computer-assisted formative
   feedback: A comparative case study
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID UNIVERSITIES
AB The national movement towards progress files, incorporating personal
   development planning and reflective learning, is supported by lecturers
   providing effective feedback to their students. Recent technological
   advances mean that higher education tutors are no longer obliged to
   return comments in the 'traditional' manner, by annotating students'
   work with red pen. This paper considers some of the options currently
   available for returning computer-assisted feedback, including the
   Electronic Feedback freeware. This MS Office application enables tutors
   to readily synthesise and email feedback reports to students. To
   further ascertain the value of this software, 169 1st-year
   Pharmaceutical Science and Pharmacy students completed a questionnaire
   to gauge their reaction to formative feedback on an extended laboratory
   report. This included 110 responses from students graded by three
   tutors who marked work using either handwritten annotations or the
   Electronic Feedback program. Principle component analysis (PCA) of the
   Likert scale responses indicates that the identity of the marker did
   not significantly affect the response of students. However, the type of
   feedback was a factor that influenced the students' responses, with
   electronic feedback being rated superior. A Mann-Whitney analysis of
   the satisfaction ratings (generated by PCA) indicates that four
   features of the assignment and feedback were considered significantly
   improved when the software was used to create feedback, namely;
   markscheme clarity, feedback legibility, information on deficient
   aspects, and identification of those parts of the work where the
   student did well. Modern academics face a number of challenges if they
   wish to return meaningful and timely feedback to students, among them
   large class sizes and infrequent face-to-face contact. It is pleasing
   to note, therefore, that assessors reported taking less time to mark
   when using the software. It is concluded that electronic formative
   feedback can be returned more quickly and may be used to synthesise
   relevant feedback that is both fair and balanced.

TI Talk the talk: Learner-generated podcasts as catalysts for knowledge
   creation
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Podcasting allows audio content from one or more user-selected feeds or
   channels to be automatically downloaded to one's computer as it becomes
   available, then later transferred to a portable player for consumption
   at a convenient time and place. It is enjoying phenomenal growth in
   mainstream society, alongside other Web 2.0 technologies that enable
   Internet users to author and distribute rich media content quickly and
   easily. Instead of using the technology for the mere recording and
   dissemination of lectures and other instructor-centred information, the
   project reported on in this article focused on enabling students to
   create their own podcasts for distribution to their peers. The article
   describes how engaging in the podcasting exercise promoted
   collaborative knowledge building among the student-producers, as
   evidenced through focus-group interviewing and an analysis of the
   products of their shared dialogue and reflection. The findings suggest
   that the collaborative development of audio learning objects enabling
   student conceptualisations of disciplinary content to be shared with
   peers is a powerful way of stimulating both individual and collective
   learning, as well as supporting social processes of perspective-taking
   and negotiation of meaning that underpin knowledge creation.

ID TEAM; PERFORMANCE; EXPERT
AB The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of coordination
   support (tool support and tutor support) on the development of shared
   mental models (SMMs) and coordinated action in a computer-supported
   collaborative learning environment. Eighteen students were randomly
   assigned to one of three conditions, including the tool condition, the
   tutor condition, and the control condition (two groups per condition).
   Groups in the tool condition were given the task management tools;
   groups in the tutor condition received assistance from a tutor about
   coordination; and the control groups did not receive any support. SMMs
   were assessed on a 5-point Likert scale and coordinated action was
   analysed by examining learners' logfiles. The findings of this study
   suggest that tool support facilitates the development of SMMs and
   promotes coordinated action of each group.

ID RECOGNITION
AB A new computerised testing system was used at home to promote learning
   and also to save classroom instruction time. The testing system
   combined the features of short-answer and multiple-choice formats. The
   questions of the multiple-choice problems were presented without the
   options so that students had to generate answers for themselves; they
   could click for the options when they were ready, and could choose one
   of the options within a brief, specified time period. One hundred
   thirty-eight Korean sixth-grade students (12-year olds) were divided
   into two groups: the experimental group took the intervening test on
   social studies using the new computerised testing method, and the
   control group used a computerised version of the traditional
   multiple-choice method. A few days after the intervening computerised
   test, a recall posttest was given in paper-and-pencil format. The mean
   posttest score was greater for the experimental group than for the
   control group. Implications of the result are discussed.

AB The purpose of this study was to rethink the conceptualization of
   pedagogical content knowledge based on our descriptive research
   findings and to show how this new conceptualization helps us to
   understand teachers as professionals. This study was a multiple case
   study grounded in a social constructivist framework. Data were
   collected from multiple sources and analysed using three approaches:
   (a) constant comparative method, (b) enumerative approach, and (c)
   in-depth analysis of explicit PCK. The results indicated that (a) PCK
   was developed through reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action
   within given instructional contexts, (b) teacher efficacy emerged as an
   affective affiliate of PCK, (c) students had an important impact on PCK
   development, (d) students' misconceptions played a significant role in
   shaping PCK, and (e) PCK was idiosyncratic in some aspects of its
   enactment. Discussion centres on how these five aspects are related to
   teacher professionalism.

AB This research study aims to examine the effectiveness of a
   problem-based learning (PBL) on 9th grade students' understanding of
   intermolecular forces (dipole-dipole forces, London dispersion forces
   and hydrogen bonding). The student's alternate conceptions about
   intermolecular bonding and their beliefs about PBL were also measured.
   Seventy-eight 9th grade students were stratified by cognitive levels
   and then randomly assigned to experimental (PBL, 40 students) and
   control (lecture-style teaching, 38 students) groups. Following a
   preparatory lesson where activation and remediation of existing
   knowledge occur, a pre-test was given, and no significant difference
   was found between the two groups of students (p > .05). After the
   instruction was completed, a post-test and also a questionnaire related
   to the quality of the problem, the teacher's role and group functioning
   were administered. Results from the post-test of both groups (p < .05)
   and questionnaire showed that PBL is affective on students'
   achievement, remedying formation of alternate conceptions and also
   social skills.

TI Emergent theorisations in modelling the teaching of two science teachers
SO RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE emergent theorisations; grounded theory; interpretative filters;
   modelling teaching; professional knowledge; science teaching; scripts
AB The main goal of this study is to understand the teacher's thoughts and
   action when he/she is immersed in the activity of teaching. To do so,
   it describes the procedures used to model two teachers' practice with
   respect to the topic of Plant Diversity. Starting from a consideration
   of the theoretical constructs of script, routine and improvisation,
   this modelling basically corresponds to a microanalysis of the
   teacher's beliefs, goals and knowledge, as highlighted in the classroom
   activity. From the process of modelling certain theorisations emerge,
   corresponding to abstractions gained from concrete cases. They allow us
   to foreground strong relationships between the beliefs and actions, and
   the knowledge and objectives of the teacher in action. Envisaged as
   conjectures rather than generalisations, these abstractions could
   possibly be extended to other cases, and tested out with new case
   studies, questioning their formulation or perhaps demonstrating that
   the limits of their applicability do not go beyond the original cases.

AB This study compared inquiry and non-inquiry laboratory teaching in
   terms of students' perceptions of the classroom learning environment,
   attitudes toward science, and achievement among middle-school physical
   science students. Learning environment and attitude scales were found
   to be valid and related to each other for a sample of 1,434 students in
   71 classes. For a subsample of 165 students in 8 classes, inquiry
   instruction promoted more student cohesiveness than non-inquiry
   instruction (effect size of one-third of a standard deviation), and
   inquiry-based laboratory activities were found to be differentially
   effective for male and female students.

AB This research inquiry investigates the factors influencing chemistry
   teacher candidates' development during their extended practica in the
   second and final year of an After-Degree Bachelor of Education at a
   university in central Canada. A variety of data sources are used to
   identify the risk and protective factors impeding and contributing to
   the achievement of their chemistry pedagogical aspirations. Two
   theoretical frameworks, both having their origins in the pioneering
   work of Kurt Lewin, are used to conceptualize how a complex amalgam of
   personal attribute and environmental factors and the interplay among
   these factors influence teacher candidate developmental trajectories.
   The tenets of both Bronfenbrenner's bioecological model and Learning
   Environment research provide insights into how the factors influencing
   teacher candidate development can be understood and systematically
   documented to provide a template for reflective consideration of the
   practicum experience for both teacher candidates and those involved in
   fostering the development of chemistry teacher candidates.

AB Even though several studies have reported positive attitudinal outcomes
   from context-based chemistry programs, methodological obstacles have
   prevented researchers from comparing satisfactorily the
   chemistry-learning outcomes between students who experience a
   context-based program with those who experience a content-driven
   program. In this narrative inquiry we are able to address the question:
   how do the recalled experiences of a student and her teacher in
   context-based and concept-based chemistry programs compare? From the
   student's unique perspective of experiencing both programs with the
   same teacher, we have constructed our collective account around four
   themes; namely, the extent to which the student makes connections
   between chemistry concepts and real-world contexts, developing research
   independence through engaging in extended experimental investigations
   related to contexts, learning chemistry concepts through contexts, and
   conceptual sequencing in a context-based program. The student reported
   real-world connections between chemistry concepts and contexts, found
   her engagement in the context-driven tasks interesting and productive,
   and identified connected sequences of concepts across the contexts
   studied. Despite difficulties for teachers who are required to shift
   pedagogies, the student's lived experiences and outcomes from a
   context-based program provide some encouragement in working through
   these issues.

AB This paper is a report of the Australian segment of an international
   multi-campus project centred on improving understanding of the Moon's
   phases for preservice teachers. Instructional strategies adopted for a
   science education subject enabled Australian participants to make
   extended observations of the Moon's phases and keep observational data
   records which were shared in asynchronous on-line discussion with
   fellow preservice teachers in the USA. An adaptation of an online
   inventory of lunar phases was completed by participants before and
   after the observation cycle. The analysis of inventory data showed that
   although there was statistically significant overall improvement in
   mean scores for the inventory this could be accounted for by
   statistically significant increases in only some conceptual domains
   related to the lunar phases. In addition, the findings indicate that
   some concepts involved in having a deep understanding of lunar phases
   can be improved by instruction however, misunderstandings of other
   concepts involved in lunar phases are difficult to change and may
   require increased attention to developing students' visual-spatial
   capabilities.

AB The purpose of this study is to examine practicing scientists' views of
   nature of science (NOS) and explore possible relationships between
   these views and science context. Science educators emphasize teaching
   NOS through inquiry-based learning experiences throughout science
   disciplines. Yet aspects of NOS that are agreed upon as relevant to
   science education have been described in discipline-independent ways.
   Given the situated nature of learning, we sought to examine how
   scientists understand recommended aspects of NOS and whether these
   views vary depending on the science discipline or investigative context
   of authentic practice. Participants were 24 scientists, representing
   four broad science disciplines (chemistry, life science, physics,
   earth/space science) and a variety of approaches (experimental,
   descriptive, theoretical). Data included questionnaires and interviews.
   Through intra-group and cross-group comparisons, we examine
   associations between NOS views, scientific disciplines, and methods of
   scientific inquiry. Results indicate NOS views are not necessarily
   related to science context. There appears to be as much variation
   within groups as across groups. Differences in views seem to be
   embedded within individual contexts and experiences rather than broader
   science disciplines. Results support the applicability of advocated NOS
   aspects across science contexts, and do not support a need to teach
   different natures of science in the K-12 science arena. We discuss the
   implications for NOS pedagogy in a variety of contexts.

AB Children's stereotypes about scientists have been postulated to affect
   student science identity and interest in science. Findings from prior
   studies using "Draw a Scientist Test" methods suggest that students see
   scientists as largely white, often unattractive, men; one consequence
   may be that girls and minority students feel a science career is "not
   like me". However, a major shortcoming in prior research is that
   scholars have asked children to draw only scientists, thus making
   interpretations of earlier research findings ambiguous. We added other
   professionals to compare how 616 drawings of teachers, scientists, and
   veterinarians by 206 elementary school children varied by student
   gender, ethnicity, and grade. Students made clear distinctions: drawing
   teachers as most attractive and largely female, and scientists as most
   often male and least attractive. Aspects of the drawings suggest that
   scientists do have an "image problem" among children. However, large
   sex differences in the drawings and often-unrecognizable gender figures
   in boys' pictures lead us to question use of the "Draw a Scientist
   Test" as a projective test among young children.

AB The often portrayed media image of the scientist is a rather strange
   one, grim-looking scientists, usually male, poised beside
   incomprehensible instruments. It is little wonder that we encounter the
   stereotype of the bespectacled scientist; thick black rims, coke bottle
   lenses, roman sandals, dressed in lab coats, trousers up to their
   necks. A qualitative study designed to produce a series of visual and
   oral narratives based on the everyday lived realities of "the
   contemporary scientist" was undertaken. The study was a participative
   project in which a research team, including the project leaders Anne
   Noble and Michelle Lunn, together with research assistants and
   documentary photography students, worked alongside scientists to
   produce contemporary and deliberately challenging stories of "the
   scientist"(1). In this paper, the most pervasive theme to emerge from
   the research, the link between art and science, is discussed.

TI Upper secondary French students, chemical transformations and the

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

   MOLECULES; ATOMS; MISCONCEPTIONS; PROGRESSION; SCIENCE; MATTER
AB The purpose of this study is to identify how upper secondary school
   French students (Grade 10-12) interpret chemical transformation with
   regards to the changes within molecules and atoms, and in terms of
   intramolecular and/or intermolecular bond breaking. In order to
   identify and describe the students' assimilated knowledge, four
   questions were asked to 930 students using a written questionnaire
   submitted a long time after the related teaching took place. There is
   much research into student learning in the concept areas discussed here
   (atoms and molecules, chemical change, chemical bonding), as reviewed
   in the paper. The present study presents data from an educational
   system where limited work has been reported in the international
   literature. The French system has its own unique curriculum, and is
   taught in the national language (where much of the existing research
   has concerned learning in Anglophile systems). The research reported
   here found that French secondary students experienced many similar
   difficulties in understanding these key scientific concepts to those
   that have been reported elsewhere, showing the cross-cultural nature of
   the key educational issues. For example, many have difficulties in
   understanding the changes undergone by atoms and molecules in the
   course of a chemical reaction; many are not able to justify explicitly
   the breaking of inter-molecular bonds and to interpret the breaking of
   intramolecular bonds in terms of reorganization of atoms, the target
   level of understanding in the curriculum from the end of Grade 9.
   However, it is also suggested that some of the specific characteristics
   identified here are linked to the ordering and language used in the
   French curriculum, and such cultural idiosyncrasies may offer useful
   insights into both problematic and valuable aspects of science pedagogy.

AB In this paper we explore the relationship between learning gains,
   measured through pre-assessment and post-assessment, and engagement in
   scientific argumentation. In order to do so, this paper examines group
   discourse and individual learning during the implementation of NASA
   Classroom of the Future's BioBLAST! (BB) software program in a high
   school biology classroom. We found that the argumentative structures,
   the quality of these structures, and the identities that students take
   on during collaborative group work are critical in influencing student
   learning and achievement in science. We provide recommendations for
   instructors implementing argumentation in their science classrooms, and
   provide suggestions for the development of future research in this area.

AB Currently, numerous on-line discussion forums have been developed for
   educational purposes; therefore, a better understanding about peer
   student discussion or discourse interactions is quite important.
   Through gathering peer learning interactions oil 57 college computer
   science students, who were randomly assigned into 14 small groups for
   solving programming problems, this study analyzed the content of their
   discourse interactions. First, it was revealed that the most frequent
   interactions were related to some questions or suggestions regarding
   how to effectively coordinate peer members. However, different features
   of peer interactions were found across different small groups. By time
   sequence analysis of peer interactions, it was found that issues and
   positions were proposed mostly in the initial and middle stages of the
   study, while the conflicts frequently occurred in the beginning stage.
   Finally, this study suggested five peer interaction patterns in terms
   of peer knowledge exchange, including centralized knowledge exchange,
   distributive knowledge exchange, group development impediment, ability
   impediment and partial knowledge exchange. A further analysis of
   students' knowledge exchange patterns revealed that peer students'
   background abilities played all important role oil the ways of
   knowledge exchange involved in the on-line peer learning activity.
   Certain configurations of students' background abilities tended to lead
   to a particular communication pattern. The implications derived from
   the findings for educational practice were also discussed. For example,
   the small groups with peer members of high achievement (or
   heterogeneous abilities) may not guarantee the success of group work.
   Many of them need teachers or moderators to scaffold the process of
   peer interactions and learning. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The purpose of this study was to consider the efficacy and popularity
   of "Virtual Lectures" (text-based, structured electronic courseware
   with information presented in manageable "chunks", interaction and
   multimedia) and "e-Lectures" (on-screen synchrony of PowerPoint slides
   and recorded voice) as alternatives to traditional lectures. We
   considered how three modes of delivery compare when increasingly deeper
   forms of learning are assessed and also student reaction to electronic
   delivery. Fifty-eight students in three groups took three topics of a
   human genetics module, one in each delivery style. Results indicated no
   overall greater efficacy of either delivery style when all question
   types were taken into account but significantly different
   delivery-specific results depending on which level of Bloom's taxonomy
   was assessed. That is, overall, questions assessing knowledge
   consistently achieved the highest marks followed by analysis,
   comprehension, evaluation and application. Students receiving
   traditional lectures scored significantly lower marks for comprehension
   questions. Students receiving Virtual Lectures scored high for
   knowledge, comprehension and application but significantly lower for
   analysis and evaluation questions. The e-Lectures scored high for
   knowledge questions and were the median for all question types except
   application. Questionnaire analysis revealed a preference for
   traditional lectures over computer-based but nevertheless an
   appreciation of the advantages offered by them. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The purpose of this article is to propose a model to integrate
   educational mastery principles that emphasize cooperative and
   learner-centered instruction in higher education with the new advances
   of instructional technology, and to present a pilot case study to
   exemplify the model. It is clear that in spite of tremendous efforts by
   colleges and universities to introduce instructional technology in the
   classroom, many faculty remain skeptical of the new technologies. It is
   suggested that in order for instructional technology to be widely
   accepted and used by faculty, the value of this technology to improve
   classroom instruction has to be proven. It is proposed that this can be
   achieved by applying learner-centered principles, in which the
   instructional objectives of the class are directly linked both to the
   needs of the student and the role of the instructor in the classroom,
   which in turn determine the appropriate type and use of instructional
   technology. It presents a pilot case study in which a technology was
   used to teach a basic psychology concept. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The Internet enables learners to be brought together where they can
   cooperate in learning in groups without space and time limitations. It
   is, however, quite a challenge to form ideal groups in a short time and
   ensure satisfactory interaction for learners in cyberspace. In this
   study, we propose a useful grouping method to help teachers improve
   group-learning in e-learning by first establishing effective groups
   with rules based on data ruining, and then facilitating student
   interaction using a system that monitors members' communication status.
   Field observations and quantitative evidence show the validity and
   practicability of the proposed method. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB This study of the flow of online discussions examined how earlier
   messages affected later messages along five dimensions: (1) evaluations
   (agreement, disagreement, or unresponsive actions); (2) knowledge
   content (contribution, repetition, or null content); (3) social cues
   (positive, negative, or none); (4) personal information (number of
   visits); and (5) elicitation (eliciting response or not). Using
   sequential logit regressions and a structural equation model (SEM),
   this study analyzed 131 messages across seven topics in the mathematics
   forum of a university Bulletin Board System (BBS) Website. Results
   showed that a disagreement or contribution in the previous message
   increased the likelihoods of disagreements and social cue displays in
   the current message. Unlike face-to-face discussions, online discussion
   messages that disagreed with an earlier message were more likely to
   elicit responses. Together, these results support the claims that
   teachers can use and manage online discussions at the message level to
   promote critical thinking, facilitate discussion of controversial
   topics, and reduce status effects. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB In the past decade, the use of computer technology for language
   instruction has expanded rapidly. In Taiwan, overseas Students whose
   native languages are not Chinese mostly get trouble in learning and
   communicating particularly during the first year of their Study. To
   overcome their language barrier in National Chi Nan University (NCNU),
   a Web-based Chinese classroom (http://chinese.csie.ncnu.edu.tw)
   exploiting advanced Web and multimedia technologies has been initiated
   since 2002. This paper presents the core developments of the Web-based
   Synchronized Multimedia Lecture (WSML) system for fulfilling language
   learning requirements oil listening, speaking, reading and writing. It
   facilitates students in Chinese comprehension self-learning oil the Web
   and call easily be customized for different foreign language learning.
   Technical issues are addressed from two perspectives to meet the
   pedagogical approaches of teaching and learning foreign languages: (1)
   the synchronized multimedia tutoring and the exercise practice
   functions for students, and (2) the multimedia lecture authoring and
   the exercise management tools for teachers. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

TI Text-based synchronous e-learning and dyslexia: Not necessarily the
   perfect match!
SO COMPUTERS & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE e-learning; synchronous learning activities; learning disabilities;
   dyslexia
AB The introduction, in the United Kingdom, of the Special Education Needs
   and Disabilities Act (SENDA) published and approved in 2001, has
   removed the exemptions given to educational institutions by the
   Disabilities Discrimination Act (DDA) of 1995. This applies to learning
   web sites and materials that must now undergo "reasonable adjustments",
   in order not to disadvantage students with learning disabilities as
   well as non-disabled students. This paper discusses how e-learning and
   the inherent use of online learning activities raises problems for
   students with dyslexia far beyond accessibility and web design. This
   paper aims at proposing that the so widely proclaimed advantages of
   e-learning to bridge distances, different learning paces and cognitive
   styles, is at the same time producing close to insurmountable barriers
   to students with cognitive disabilities in general, and dyslexia
   specifically. It presents the results of a research project aiming at
   uncovering evidence that students with dyslexia are in fact less likely
   to thrive in a synchronous e-learning environment. The paper reports on
   it set of experiments undertaken with students when engaged in online
   authentic synchronous learning activities. The paper focuses on
   text-based synchronous activities, since it is the widest and most
   commonly used synchronous technology, and provides clear evidence that
   it can marginalise, demotivate and disappoint students with dyslexia
   with difficulties in reading, spelling, word order and argumentation.

AB Gender differences between participation in face-to-face and web-based
   classroom discussions were examined, by comparing the men-women actual
   participation ratio to the men-women attendance (or login) ratio. It
   was found that men over-proportionally spoke at the face-to-face
   classroom whereas women over-proportionally posted messages in the
   web-based conference. Two alternative explanations are discussed. It is
   suggested that either women prefer written communication more than men
   do, or that women prefer written communication over spoken
   communication. Nonetheless, despite some advantages of virtual
   discussions, especially for women, the online environment is apparently
   not attractive enough for either gender. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The study investigated the effects of computer collaborative group
   work, facilitated by all adult, oil peer acceptance of a junior boy
   with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It aimed to
   ascertain whether collaborative group work oil a computer, with the
   facilitation of an adult, could help to raise his peer acceptance among
   his classmates. Data were gathered before and after computer group work
   sessions. Interviews and questionnaires were conducted oil parents and
   teachers to help establish the history background data and their
   concerns oil the boy's peer acceptance. Sociometrics testing of
   classmates was used to determine peer acceptance among the boy's
   immediate peer group. During the adult-facilitated computer sessions,
   the facilitator reinforced positive social behaviour and interactions.
   After the computer sessions, interviews and questionnaires were
   conducted again oil parents, teachers and facilitator in all attempt to
   capture information oil the child's behaviour and attitudes during the
   computer sessions. Sociometrics testing was also conducted again to
   determine if the peer acceptance among the boy's immediate peer group
   has changed. The results indicated encouraging improvements in the
   raise of his peer acceptance among his classmates in general. although
   this was a discrete setting, the finding is promising and this strategy
   may be replicated in School to support Mainstream inclusion for
   children with ADHD. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID TRANSACTIVE MEMORY
AB By virtue of the non-profit nature of school education, a professional
   virtual community composed of teachers provides precious data to
   understand the processes of knowledge sharing and creation. Guided by
   grounded theory, the authors conducted a three-phased study on a
   teachers' virtual community in order to understand the knowledge flows
   among community members from different organizations. This study also
   portrays the process of knowledge sharing and creation for teachers
   participating in virtual teams of a teachers' professional community.
   The resulting model articulates causal conditions, action/interaction
   strategies, consequence, and contextual environments. The concept of
   knowledge buckle is derived to connect the knowledge transfer among
   socialization, externalization, and combination activities. (C) 2006

   in education. This potential has not been fully realised for range of
   interrelated reasons. fit this paper We Study the key characteristics
   of learning resources that have proved effective in changing learning
   and teaching, and relate them to existing frameworks for understanding
   resources. We outline the relationships between resources, their users,
   and the way they are used, and explore issues that influence
   practitioners in choosing a particular resource. Our study is based on
   a review of resources for e-learning and chemistry in post-compulsory
   education, undertaken for the UK Joint Information Systems Committees
   (JISC), as part of a wider study examining 'The Effectiveness of
   Resources, Tools and Support Set-vices used by Tutors in Designing and

AB The aim of this series of applications is to enhance students' spatial
   perception capacity by means of exercises that require the student to
   concentrate on mentally recreating the figures represented.
   Each application is designed with an increasing level of difficulty,
   designed to increase the students' concentration and train their
   spatial perception. In order to foment a degree of competition among
   the users and motivate them to try to improve the result achieved in
   each exercise, a scoring system was implemented, showing the best score
   obtained both by the user and in the class as a whole.
   Macromedia Flash tools were used to develop the applications, as these
   allow the generation of Web-viewable applications of a very small size.
   In this way, we were able to develop applications accessible to the
   students and that do not entail any very demanding minimum
   requirements. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main purpose of this study was to establish Information Literacy
   Competence Standards for Elementary and High School Teachers. To
   establish these standards a set of two expert round-table discussions
   and three rounds of Delphi Technique surveys were employed. Ten
   participants including field scholars, information professionals were
   invited to the expert round-table for open discussions on definitions,
   framework, and items of information literacy competence. A
   questionnaire for the "Delphi Technique Survey" was developed based on
   the results acquired from the round-table discussions. The resulting
   questionnaire was distributed to another group of 33 participants which
   included graduate school deans of Information Education, professors,
   school principals, department directors and teachers, and information
   professionals. After three rounds of Delphi Technique Surveys with
   these participants, the "Information Literacy Competence Standards for
   Elementary and High School Teachers" was established. Three levels
   (standards, main indicators, and secondary indicators) and three
   dimensions (knowledge, skills, and attitudes) were identified.
   Distinguished from existing research which over-emphasizes the
   dimensions of knowledge and skills, the present study found that the
   dimension "attitude" is the most powerful force for promoting teachers'
   information literacy competence and their willingness to apply
   information technology in teaching. It is hoped that the proposed
   standards could be served as it self-evaluation tool for teachers as
   well as the basis for staffing and training programs for elementary and
   high school teachers in Taiwan. (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The research presented in this paper is ail examination of the
   applicability of IUI techniques in an online e-learning environment. In
   particular we make use of user modeling techniques, information
   retrieval and extraction mechanisms and collaborative filtering
   methods. The domains of e-learning, web-based training and instruction
   and intelligent tutoring systems provide a challenging environment due
   to the large and diverse user population it entails. The overall system
   concentrates on utilizing a user modeling system to filter results as
   part of a collaborative document recommendation system. The goal of
   such a system is to actively seek out and recommend documents that will
   either encourage the users to expand their knowledge of a given topic
   or reinforce the knowledge which they already have. The system aims to
   recommend these documents in a non-intrusive manner with minimal user
   inconvenience, and attempts to do so by utilizing the Key Extraction
   Algorithm and automatically extracting queries, searching the web and
   filtering the search results. Users are encouraged to provide feedback
   about the resources and links they have viewed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Each year the ACM hosts a truly international programming contest - the
   International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). Dating back to a
   contest held by Texas A&M University in 1970, this annual event, along
   with the associated regional contests, has grown to 5606 teams from
   1733 universities in 84 countries (in the year 2006).
   Despite the maturity of the event, and the number of competitors, there
   has never been a systematic examination of contest strategy. Herein
   several strategies are proposed and examined to determine whether a
   team call gain all advantage by choosing a good strategy; and, if so,
   then what that strategy should be.
   We show that a team call gain in advantage by choosing a good strategy,
   but that there is no one best strategy. A team must choose between
   winning by number of solved problems and winning by points. Finding the
   optimal strategy to will by problems is shown to be NP-complete, while
   to win by points a team must solve problems in order from easiest to
   hardest. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The success of a virtual learning environment (VLE) depends to a
   considerable extent on student acceptance and use of such an e-learning
   system. After critically assessing models of technology adoption,
   including the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), TAM2, and the Unified
   Theory of Acceptance and Usage of Technology (UTAUT), we build a
   conceptual model to explain the differences between individual students
   in the level of acceptance and use of a VLE. This model extends TAM2
   and includes subjective norm, personal innovativeness in the domain of
   information technology, and computer anxiety. Data were collected from
   45 Chinese participants in an Executive MBA program. After performing
   satisfactory reliability and validity checks, the structural model was
   tested with the use of PLS. Results indicate that perceived usefulness
   has a direct effect on VLE use. Perceived ease of use and subjective
   norm have only indirect effects via perceived usefulness. Both personal
   innovativeness and computer anxiety have direct effects on perceived
   ease of use only. Implications are that program managers in education
   should not only concern themselves with basic system design but also
   explicitly address individual differences between VLE users. (C) 2006

AB The purpose of this study was to integrate asynchronous learning
   technology with teaching strategies oil observation and writing into a
   teacher education method course. The research questions were to explore
   the effects of the innovative teaching method and to compare it with
   the traditional teaching method. There were 134 preservice teachers
   involved in this study. This study Used a mixed method design,
   incorporating both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The main
   data included questionnaires, observation reports, and on-line
   information. According to the findings, there were significant
   differences in the "teaching and learning interaction" and "application
   of technology and theories" (F=9.728, P < 0.01, and F= 16.88, P <
   0.001, respectively.), but there were no significant differences in the
   other aspects. The results also showed the experimental teaching method
   combined the effect of both traditional classroom and online teaching,
   and reinforced the integration of teaching theories and practices. The
   preservice teachers reflected that they had learned how to integrate
   technologies with teaching through the learning environment of the
   asynchronous learning network and teaching observation. The interactive
   teaching and learning of this study could supplement the any existing
   deficiencies in traditional teaching. Therefore, the experimental
   teaching method is not only a way to construct knowledge, theories and
   experiences of teaching, but also a good strategy to promote the
   utilization of instructional technology within teaching for preservice
   teachers. The limitations in the asynchronous learning technology and
   the difficulties associated with the preservice teachers' learning
   processes were also discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The results of empirical experiments evaluating the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the learning-forgetting-relearning process in a dynamic
   project management simulation environment are reported. Sixty-six
   graduate engineering students performed repetitive simulation-runs with
   a break period of several weeks between the runs. The students used a
   teaching tool called the project management trainer (PMT) that
   simulates a generic dynamic, stochastic project management environment.
   In this research, we focused oil the effect of history recording
   mechanism on the learning forgetting process. Manual or automatic
   history recording mechanisms were used by the experimental group, while
   the control group did not use any history recording mechanism. The
   findings indicate that for the initial learning phase, the manual
   mechanism is better than the automatic mechanism. However, for the
   relearning phase, the break period length influenced the performance
   after the break. When the break period is short, the manual history
   keeping mechanism is better, but for a long period break, there is no
   significant difference. A comparison between the experimental group and
   the control group revealed that using any history recording mechanism
   reduced forgetting. Based on the findings, some practical implications
   of using simulators to improve the learning-forgetting process are
   discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The key limitation of handheld technology for the delivery of learning
   objects is the small screen that is available for effective display.
   The smallness of the screen not only adversely affects the clarity, but
   it also negatively impacts oil the acceptance and integration of this
   potentially useful technology in education. Handheld devices are likely
   to change further in size in the future with consumer demand for less
   bulky but more powerful devices. This exploratory study investigated
   characteristics of effective design of learning objects oil such
   devices. This paper reports upon user response to learning object
   design possibilities and provides a set of recommendations to guide
   improved utility and future research. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The web-based e-learning system (WELS) has emerged as a new means of
   skill training and knowledge acquisition, encouraging both academia and
   industry to invest resources in the adoption of this system.
   Traditionally, most pre- and post-adoption tasks related to evaluation
   are carried out from the viewpoints of technology. Since users have
   been widely recognized as being a key group of stakeholders in
   influencing the adoption of information systems, their attitudes toward
   this system are pivotal. Therefore, based on the theory of
   multi-criteria decision making and the research products of user
   satisfaction from the fields of human-computer interaction and
   information systems, this study proposed a multi-criteria methodology
   from the perspective of learner satisfaction to support those
   evaluation-based activities taking place at the pre- and post-adoption
   phases of the WELS life cycle. In addition, by following this
   methodology, this study empirically investigated learners' perceptions
   of the relative importance of decision criteria. This investigation
   carried out a survey of college students, and the data thus obtained
   was then analyzed by analytic hierarchy process in order to derive an
   integrated preference structure of learners as a ground for evaluation.
   We found that learners regarded the learner interface as being the most
   important dimension of, decision criteria. Future applications of these
   results are recommended and the implications are discussed. (C) 2006

AB Recently, a debate has begun over whether in-class laptops aid or
   hinder learning. While some research demonstrates that laptops can be
   an important learning tool, anecdotal evidence Suggests more and more
   faculty are banning laptops from their classrooms because of
   perceptions that they distract Students and detract from learning. The
   current research examines the nature of in-class laptop use in a large
   lecture Course and how that use is related to student learning.
   Students completed weekly surveys of attendance, laptop use, and
   aspects of the classroom environment. Results showed that students who
   used laptops in class spent considerable time multitasking and that the
   laptop use posed a significant distraction to both users and fellow
   students. Most importantly, the level of laptop use was negatively
   related to several measures of Student learning, including
   self-reported understanding of course material and overall course
   performance. The practical implications of these findings are
   discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Electronic examination systems, which include Internet-based system,
   require extremely complicated installation, configuration and
   maintenance of software as well as hardware. In this paper, we present
   the design and development of a flexible, easy-to-use and secure
   examination system (e-Test), in which any commonly used computer can be
   used as a platform for a computer-based assessment. In our scheme, the
   e-Test program and the other associated data files, which include
   questions and answers, user registration information and configuration
   database as well as score files, are all stored in a single lomega Zip
   disk. To ensure security, all the data files are encrypted and can only
   be decrypted by the e-Test program. Also, during initialization, the
   e-Test program will attempt to detect and identify the globally unique
   physical address of the network card of the test computer used. Only
   those computers with a pre-registered network card will be able to run
   the test program. In addition, the system developed also provides
   friendly user interfaces for the examiners to change the test
   questions, adding and deleting student names and computers for the
   assessment as well as other system parameters. The system developed has
   been successfully used in a randomized multiple choice examination in a
   course oil analog and digital signals involving more than 5000 full
   time second-year students. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB E-learning technologies have developed greatly in recent years, with
   considerable success. However, there is increasing evidence that
   web-based learning is not reaching the social sectors which are more
   reluctant to contact with the new technologies, thus leading to
   inequalities in the access to education and knowledge in the
   Information Society. By hiding the intricacies of computers behind the
   familiarity of household equipment, Interactive Digital TV (IDTV) is
   considered to play it key role in addressing this problem, and the term
   t-learning has been recently coined to mean TV-based interactive
   learning.
   Despite several approaches to t-learning have been proposed, works are
   missing that conceive it as a whole, delimit its scope in comparison
   with web-based learning and analyze the influence of the normalization
   of IDTV as a services platform. This paper addresses these issues, and
   introduces a framework for the development and deployment oft-learning
   services that promotes interoperability and reuse while taking into
   account the characteristic features of the IDTV medium. (C) 2006

AB The Web-based technology is a potential tool for supported
   collaborative learning that may enrich learning performance, such as
   individual knowledge construction or group knowledge sharing. Thus,
   understanding Web-based collaborative learning for knowledge management
   is a critical issue. The present study is to investigate learners'
   attitudes toward Web-based collaborative learning systems. Based on
   this research, the results of factor analysis show that five attitude
   factors (system functions, system satisfaction, collaborative
   activities, learners' characteristics, and system acceptance) should be
   examined at the same time when building a Web-based collaborative
   learning system. The results also provide an acceptance model for
   understanding users' behavioral intention of facilitating Web-based
   collaborative systems. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a research study carried out to support and
   structure virtual interaction among university students that may
   trigger collaborative knowledge construction in the Web, supported by a
   CSCL system called KnowCat. Three characteristics of the KnowCat system
   are relevant to our educational purpose: firstly, students can share
   and consult their documents, enabling them to find out how their
   classmates have accomplished a specific task; secondly, students can
   express their opinion about any document in the system. These opinions
   have been used in our study as explicit assistance, or scaffold, which
   one student gives another in order to improve his/her work. Thirdly,
   the KnowCat system supports students with coordinating their
   perspectives on specific knowledge through a mechanism called Knowledge
   Crystallisation, which organises community knowledge as a result of
   their participants' interactions. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Recent researches have demonstrated the importance of concept map and
   its versatile applications especially in e-Learning. For example, while
   designing adaptive learning materials, designers need to refer to the
   concept map of a subject domain. Moreover, concept maps can show the
   whole picture and core knowledge about a subject domain. Research from
   literature also suggests that graphical representation of domain
   knowledge can reduce the problems of information overload and learning
   disorientation for learners. However, construction of concept maps
   typically relied upon domain experts in the past; it is a time
   consuming and high cost task. Concept maps creation for emerging new
   domains such as e-Learning is even more challenging due to its ongoing
   development nature. The aim of this paper is to construct e-Learning
   domain concept maps from academic articles. We adopt some relevant
   journal articles and conference papers in e-Learning domain as data
   sources, and apply text-mining techniques to automatically construct
   concept maps for e-Learning domain. The constructed concept maps can
   provide a useful reference for researchers, who are new to the
   e-Leaning field, to study related issues, for teachers to design
   adaptive learning materials, and for learners to understand the whole
   picture of e-Learning domain knowledge. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

DE computer-supported collaborative learning; computer-mediated
   communication; collaborative learning; interactive learning
   environments; cross-cultural projects
AB Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) has been the subject
   of a wide range of studies over the last twenty years. Previous
   research suggests that CSCL exchanges can facilitate group-based
   learning and knowledge construction among learners who are in different
   geographical locations (Littleton, K. & Whitelock, D. (2004). Guiding
   the creation of knowledge and understanding in a virtual learning
   environment. Cyberpsychology & Behaviour, 7(2), 173). A less known
   fact, however, is that successful CSCL exchanges depend on the social
   interaction that takes place among participants. This social
   interaction is crucial, since it affects both cognitive and
   socio-emotional processes that take place during learning (Kreijns, K.,
   Kirschner, P., Jochems, W. & Van Buuren, H. (2004). Determining
   sociability, social space, and social presence in (a) synchronous
   collaborative groups. Cyberpsychology & Behaviour, 7 (2), 156).
   Nevertheless, its presence in these exchanges should not be taken for
   granted, since there are certain barriers which may impede interaction;
   for example, students may not know each other previously (high social
   distance) and requests and offers which appear recurrently in
   collaborative learning messages can threaten the participants' negative
   face (Brown and Levinson 1978, 1987). In order to explore how
   participants overcome these barriers, we have analysed the linguistic
   features of politeness strategies used in the introductory c-mails
   exchanged between eleven students and their partners, who are students
   of English and Spanish, respectively. Our findings show that partners
   in collaborative e-mail exchanges do not use negative politeness
   strategies as often as we might expect in encounters where the social
   distance between participants is high, but they rely heavily on
   positive politeness strategies, especially those relating to 'claiming
   common ground', 'assuming or asserting reciprocity' and 'conveying
   cooperation'. The presence of these strategies would indicate that
   fostering closeness, solidarity and cohesion becomes the priority to be
   achieved between the partners, instead of the expected negative
   politeness mechanisms whose aim is to demonstrate high social distance
   and, therefore, formality and impersonality. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB This study aimed to design and evaluate multimedia games which were
   based on the theories of children's development of taxonomic concepts.
   Factors that might affect children's classification skills, such as use
   of single physical characteristics of objects, competition between
   thematic and taxonomic relationships, difficulty in forming
   hierarchical categories, were identified. Several strategies for
   overcoming the above disadvantages, such as verbal hints, linguistic
   labeling, exemplar comparison, and explicit statements were implemented
   in the Software for Rebuilding Taxonomy (SoRT) for improving children's
   taxonomic concept learning. Sixty children, aged 4 and 5, participated
   in the evaluation of SoRT. The results showed that the SoRT was helpful
   to improve children's distinction between thematic and taxonomic
   relationships and their learning of hierarchical taxonomic concepts.

AB This review introduces the concepts of gender bias and technology in
   education. It discusses the interaction between the two in the
   educational setting and the effects this interaction may have on
   teachers, students and materials used in the classroom. It is argued
   that areas in the educational setting that have been focused on as
   materials and practices that are biased have also been translated into
   the use of educational technology that is biased. This review makes the
   point that biases that have been pointed out and studied within the
   educational system have not been solved by the use of technology (as
   some had hoped). In fact, the biases have simply been converted into a
   new form and may have actually served to undo some the bias-eliminating
   practices that had been starting to take place in classrooms.
   Implications and suggestions for change are discussed. (C) 2006

AB Research involving gifted and grade-level students has shown that they
   display differences in their knowledge of self-regulatory strategies.
   However, little research exists regarding whether these students differ
   ill their actual use of these strategies. This study aimed to address
   this question by examining think-aloud data collected from 98 gifted
   and grade-level students engaging in a complex learning task: utilizing
   a hypermedia environment to learn about the circulatory system. We also
   examined both declarative knowledge and mental model measures of
   learning to determine whether these groups differed in their actual
   performance. Our results show that gifted students did outperform
   grade-level students in all outcome measures. [it addition, gifted
   students more often utilized more sophisticated self-regulatory
   strategies (e.g. coordinating informational sources) than grade-level
   students. Grade-level students were more likely to use less effective
   strategies that are less likely to promote the acquisition of knowledge
   (e.g. mnemonics). Recommendations for future intervention studies are
   based upon these findings. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The development of modern technologies and their extension to every
   domain of our daily life nowadays is an indisputable fact. The
   widespread use of computers renders training in these technologies
   necessary. Consequently, computers were soon introduced into the Greek
   educational system. Factors related to the nature of the teacher's
   personality, such as computer self-efficacy, self-concept, attitudes,
   motivation and needs are considered crucial to the integration and
   development of modern technologies in education. This study examines
   the relationship between individual characteristics of secondary school
   teachers and computer self-efficacy as well as teacher prospects with
   regard to modern technologies. (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study was designed to investigate the effects of teaching critical
   thinking skills (CTS) in a large class through asynchronous discussion
   forums (ADFs) with the facilitation of teaching assistants. A pretest
   and posttest quasi-experimental design with a comparison group was
   employed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The
   independent variable was the structured ADFs with two levels-without
   Socratic dialogues, and with Socratic dialogues, modeled and
   facilitated by the teaching assistants via structured ADFs, while the
   dependent variable was the students' levels of CTS as measured by two
   different evaluations: (a) the California Critical Thinking Skills
   Test, to holistically examine students' gains in their CTS, and (b) the
   Coding Scheme for Evaluating Critical Thinking in Computer
   Conferencing, to investigate students' interaction patterns and the
   depth of their critical thinking (CT) demonstrated via the ADF. The
   evaluation data were collected from 278 college students in Taiwan. The
   qualitative analysis provided a detailed description of how students'
   discussions moved from the lower to the higher phases of CT. Results
   indicated that an inspired instructor and some energetic teaching
   assistants who use Socratic dialogues during small-group online
   discussions can successfully develop students' CTS in a large
   university class.

AB This study examined the effects of prior knowledge, learner preference
   for control, and type of control (learner or program) on the
   achievement of middle-school students in a computer-based instructional
   program on adding and subtracting integers. Students were blocked by
   preference-for-control scores and randomly assigned to either a
   learner-control or program-control version of instruction. A
   significant three-way interaction (prior knowledge x preference scores
   x type of control) revealed that students with high prior knowledge
   achieved better on the posttest when their preference for control was
   matched with the type of control they received, whereas students with
   low prior knowledge achieved better when their preference was
   mismatched. A significant three-way interaction on attitude reflected
   the same pattern found in the interaction for achievement scores. The
   overall results indicate that matching learner preference to the type
   of program they receive is an effective strategy for
   high-prior-knowledge students but not for those with low prior
   knowledge.

AB Causal reasoning represents one of the most basic and important
   cognitive processes that underpin all higher-order activities, such as
   conceptual understanding and problem solving. Hume called causality the
   "cement of the universe" [Hume (1739/2000). Causal reasoning is
   required for making predictions, drawing implications and inferences,
   and explaining phenomena. Causal relations are usually more complex
   than learners understand. In order to be able to understand and apply
   causal relationships, learners must be able to articulate numerous
   covariational attributes of causal relationships, including direction,
   valency, probability, duration, responsiveness, as well as mechanistic
   attributes, including process, conjunctions/disjunctions, and
   necessity/sufficiency. We describe different methods for supporting
   causal learning, including influence diagrams, simulations, questions,
   and different causal modeling tools, including expert systems, systems
   dynamics tools, and causal modeling tools. Extensive research is needed
   to validate and contrast these methods for supporting causal reasoning.

   obtain a more complete impression of the effects of ICT-tools. The
   first study presented in this article shows why tools should not only
   be studied in terms of their specific intended outcomes, but also in
   terms of their effects on working memory, and the cognitive mechanisms
   needed to achieve the intended outcomes. The second study uses
   cognitive load measurements and stimulated recall interviews to obtain
   a more comprehensive view of the effects of learning tools. Results
   suggest that traditional outcome measures need to be complemented with
   quantitative and qualitative measures of cognitive processes to
   substantiate conclusions about intended effects of ICT-tools.

AB The roles of task, learner, and mentor in a successful project-based
   instructional technology (IT) internship program were studied in light
   of contemporary motivation theories. Interns in four different
   locations were asked to apply their academic experiences in
   constructing real projects at work under the supervision of their site
   mentors and academic advisor. Data included tape-recorded intern
   interviews, status-review notes, e-portfolios, mentor interviews, and
   mentor evaluations. Data were collected over 6 semesters, from 18
   different cases, 4 of which are highlighted here. The study considered
   the roles of task, learner, and mentors as they are needed to make the
   most of project-based internship programs. Implications for the design
   and development of internship and capstone programs, and specifically
   successful student performance in internship programs, are considered.

DT Article
AB Engineering education in India has witnessed a major change over the
   past few years. Substantial increase in the demand for high-quality
   education has led to the adoption of Information and Communication
   Technologies for extending the outreach of education. This paper
   presents a review of some of these technology-enhanced initiatives
   already taken up by the government of India, as well as by some of the
   leading institutions in the country. Important developments include the
   National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL), the use of
   an educational satellite called the EDUSAT and various other approaches
   such as the use of 'virtual classrooms' and 'virtual laboratories'. The
   paper goes on to discuss some of the problem areas in the present mode
   of dissemination and deployment; some possible future trends and
   modalities are also outlined. These include blending collaborative
   learning with interactive technology-enhanced learning initiatives and
   finding ways of providing support for learners' queries.

ID DIGITAL MEDIA; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; OUTCOMES
AB A wide range of tools is now available to enable teaching practitioners
   to create web-based educational materials from PowerPoint
   presentations, adding a variety of different digital media, such as
   audio and animation. The pilot study described in this paper compared
   three different systems for producing multimedia presentations from
   existing PowerPoint files. The resulting resources were tested by a
   group of disabled students and a group of non-disabled students. Our
   findings show that there were statistically significant differences
   between the two groups in relation to their interaction with the
   resources. In particular, the students with disabilities were
   significantly more active in using the available controls to customise
   the running of the presentations. The data suggest that future work on
   why students with accessibility issues made different uses of these
   resources could encourage practitioners' deployment of multimedia
   resources for the benefit of all learners.

ID SERVICE QUALITY; MEMORY; FREQUENCY; LEVEL
AB One critical success factor for e-learning is learners' satisfaction
   with it. This is affected by both positive and negative experiences in
   a learning process. This paper examines the impact of such critical
   incidents on learners' satisfaction in e-learning. In particular,
   frequent occurrence of negative critical incidents has significant
   potential of negatively affecting satisfaction. The focus of this paper
   is on assessing satisfaction with e-learning from a 'negative critical
   incidents' perspective. The paper describes a satisfaction assessment
   model, called SAFE. The results of an empirical study at the National
   Sun Yat-sen Cyber-University are used to evaluate and validate the SAFE
   model. Based on the results, the critical incidents that affect
   e-learning satisfaction are classified into four categories:
   administration, functionality, instruction and interaction. Of these,
   interaction and instruction are found to be the most important factors.

AB Learning can take place in a variety of different contexts. Two
   important categories of learning event are those which are contrived
   and those which are serendipitous. If they are to be optimally
   successful, the first of these types of event requires a level of
   planning that is commensurate with the outcomes that are to be
   achieved. Planning involves deciding upon what resources are to be used
   and how to embed 'hallmarks of quality' within the learning product
   that is finally created. Invariably, a number of models and/or
   methodologies are used to guide the creative processes that are
   involved in producing a learning event or product. This paper provides
   a historical perspective and reflection on a model of learning design
   that we have developed and which we have used successfully for creating
   interactive learning products for use in a variety of different
   contexts.

AB This paper reports on a collaborative project to improve assessment
   undertaken by a cross-discipline group of university lecturers
   (Business, Engineering and Psychology) using action research
   methodology. First-stage analysis was based on results from an
   Assessment Experience Questionnaire developed by the FAST FDTL4
   (Formative Assessment in Science Teaching - Fund for the Development of
   Teaching and Learning Phase 4) project and complementary qualitative
   data. Collaborative discussion of outcomes led to formulation of
   improvement plans within each discipline. Further conclusions were made
   surrounding the selected standardised tool and the process of
   undertaking collaborative action research across disciplines.

TI Learning from experience: an evaluation of an external nursing course

SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The delivery of pre-registration Bachelor of Nursing courses in
   Australia has primarily been through the traditional on-campus mode.
   The development and implementation of an external course mode
   necessitates pedagogical reflection on a number of delivery, design,
   implementation, and consequently evaluation, processes. This paper
   discusses one aspect of the course evaluation process of a
   pre-registration nursing course offered by the School of Nursing,
   Midwifery and Nutrition at James Cook University in regional Australia.
   Course feedback was obtained from 26 respondents through an exit survey
   which used both quantitative and qualitative questions. While the
   majority of students were satisfied with the content of subjects,
   written course material, the use of email and Web-based delivery of
   subjects, a number of respondents were less satisfied with access to
   staff and experienced difficulties with the financial costs of the
   course. Generally, however, respondents indicated they had gained a
   number of personal, academic and professional benefits through
   completing the course.

AB A Web-based learning environment has been developed to support students
   from China who are studying in the UK and are confronted by many
   cultural barriers, which may impede their academic studies. The
   electronic environment incorporates a number of approaches to support
   learning, ranging from a simple text-based presentation to more active
   methods, including opportunities to use search-based learning
   strategies. Experimental results demonstrate a clear advantage for
   these active approaches. Internet support was also provided for
   students in the form of an e-learning course for academic writing,
   which featured extensive opportunities for interactions with English
   peers. The experimental results demonstrated that the group with access
   to the e-course successfully acquired skills, resulting in their
   academic writing being indistinguishable from native English speakers.

TI Compulsory participation in online discussions: is this constructivism
   or normalisation of learning?
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENT
AB A constructivist approach in teaching and learning requires one to
   change various habitual ways for thinking (von Glasersfeld 1995). There
   is a need for different ways of thinking and doing things, if
   conventional education is to realise a constructivist worldview.
   Educators and trainers in both academic and work sectors are promoting
   the use of the Internet for flexible and learner-centred learning. The
   intention of this paper is to examine the popular online learning
   pedagogy and question if the emerging formal higher education practices
   advocate a constructivist view of knowledge. The discussion begins with
   an introduction to the constructivist view. Although participation in
   online discourse is popularly recognised as social constructivism, the
   problematisation and critique of online practices help to challenge the
   formal education interpretation of constructivism. References to the
   emerging research and established literature on learning are used to
   identify the normalising influences of academic courses that require
   compulsory participation in online discussions. The choice to learn in
   silence is discussed in reference to the power differences influencing
   online discussion participation. The emerging online pedagogy is
   challenged for its limited appreciation of diverse learning preferences
   that is a central aspect of constructivism. The conclusion of the paper
   draws from data analysis in the author's doctorate study, which is in
   progress. It proposes how online and offline educators who aim for
   learner-centred and constructivist learning could use the insights
   gained from this analysis.

AB This study pioneered an innovative project regarding the use of ICT for
   creating learning resources and opportunities for faculty members and
   adult learners on both sides of the Taiwan Straits - Taiwan and
   mainland China - that would not have been possible during the past five
   decades. This paper is based on a one-year in-depth study of an ICT
   initiative project in two established universities in Taiwan and China.
   This paper documents how the faculty members made this initiative a
   reality through collective efforts on designing, producing and
   delivering the digital learning materials by overcoming difficulties
   and challenges resulting from both distance and longtime political
   separation. The findings indicate that most of the learners gave
   positive responses to whether course content was current and of value
   and were satisfied with the instructors. This project develops a new
   and profound co-operative model and introduces a new business marketing
   opportunity for universities for the commercialisation of knowledge
   that critically meets the demands of working people in the high-tech
   arena and is driven by corporate need and the self-interest of learners
   in the Chinese and Taiwanese community. Some issues related to
   e-learning are identified and several suggestions are made in the
   conclusion for further reference.

AB Although a well-corroborated scientific theory, the theory of evolution
   has continued to cause dilemmas for some individuals who have not
   easily been able to accommodate the concepts of this theory within
   their "cognitive culture." The reason lies in the overlap of some ideas
   that the theory advocates with other social, epistemological, and
   religious beliefs. This study describes how 11 college biology students
   who completed a course on the theory of evolution perceive the
   relationship among their epistemological beliefs about science, their
   beliefs about religion, and their perception of nature and causality
   and their position regarding the theory of evolution. It also compares
   the different positions of the students to that of the course
   instructor. Questionnaires and semistructured interviews were used to
   collect data. Qualitative methods were used to analyze the data and
   identify the various positions of the students and course instructor.
   The students' positions ranged from complete acceptance to complete
   rejection of the theory of evolution. The results suggest that
   students' personal beliefs should not be dismissed or underestimated
   when teaching the theory of evolution. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   evolutionary theory by using understanding of evolutionary theory,
   epistemological beliefs, thinking dispositions, and parents'
   educational level as independent variables. Preservice biology
   teachers' thinking dispositions, their understanding of evolutionary
   theory, and their parents' educational level are positively correlated
   with acceptance of evolutionary theory. We did not find any significant
   positive correlation between epistemological beliefs and acceptance of
   evolution because of low reliability coefficients of subscales of the
   epistemological beliefs instrument. Together they explained 10.5% of
   the variance. These results suggest that studying the relationship
   between acceptance of evolutionary theory and other related factors in
   a multivariate context is more informative than examining the
   relationship between acceptance of evolutionary theory and other
   factors in isolation. Our findings indicate that studying a
   controversial issue such as acceptance of evolutionary theory in a
   multivariate fashion, using conceptual ecology as a theoretical lens to
   interpret the findings, is informative. Our results suggest the
   inclusion of thinking dispositions in conceptual ecology for biological
   evolution. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The aim of this study is to explore the ways in which students, aged
   11-14 years, account for certain changes in physical systems and the
   extent to which they draw on an energy model as a common framework for
   explaining changes observed in diverse systems. Data were combined from
   two sources: interviews with 20 individuals and an open-ended
   questionnaire that was administered to 240 students (121 upper
   elementary school students and 119 middle school students). We observed
   a wealth of approaches ranging from accounts of energy transfer and
   transformation to responses identifying specific objects or processes
   as the cause of changes. The findings also provide evidence that
   students do not seem to appreciate the transphenomenological and
   unifying nature of energy. Students' thinking was influenced by various
   conceptual difficulties that are compounded by traditional science
   teaching; for instance, students tended to confuse energy with force or
   electric current. In addition, the comparison between the responses
   from middle school students and those of elementary school students
   demonstrates that science teaching and maturation appeared to have a
   negligible influence on whether students had constructed a coherent
   energy model, which they could use consistently to account for changes
   in certain physical systems. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study investigated the development in students' nature of science
   (NOS) views in the context of an explicit inquiry-oriented
   instructional approach. Participants were 18 seventh-grade students who
   were taught by a teacher with "appropriate" knowledge about NOS. The
   intervention spanned about 3 months. During this time, students were
   engaged in three inquiry-oriented activities that were followed by
   reflective discussions of NOS. The study emphasized the tentative,
   empirical, inferential, and creative aspects of NOS. An open-ended
   questionnaire, in conjunction with semi-structured interviews, was used
   to assess students' views before, during, and after the intervention.
   Before instruction, the majority of students held naive views of the
   four NOS aspects. During instruction, the students acquired more
   informed and "intermediary" views of the NOS aspects. By the end of the
   intervention, the students' views of the NOS aspects had developed
   further still into informed and "intermediary." These findings suggest
   a developmental model in which students' views develop along a
   continuum during which they pass through intermediary views to reach
   more informed views. Implications for teaching and learning of NOS are
   discussed. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Pre-service teachers face many challenges as they learn to teach in
   ways that are different from their own educational experiences.
   Pre-service teachers often enter teacher education courses with
   pre-conceptions about teaching and learning that may or may not be
   consistent with contemporary learning theory. To build on preservice
   teachers' prior knowledge, we need to identify the types of views they
   have when entering teacher education courses and the views they develop
   throughout these courses. The study reported here focuses specifically
   on preservice teachers' views of their own students' prior knowledge
   and the implications these views have on their understanding of the
   formative assessment process. Sixty-one preservice teachers were
   studied from three sections of a science methods course. Results
   indicate that preservice teachers exhibited a limited number of views
   about students' prior knowledge. These views tended to privilege either
   academic or experience-based concepts for different aspects of
   formative assessment, in contrast to contemporary perspectives on
   teaching for understanding. Rather than considering these views as
   misconceptions, it is argued that it is more useful to consider them as
   resources for further development of a more flexible concept of
   formative assessment. Four common views are discussed in detail and
   applied to science teacher preparation. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The focus of this collaborative research project of King's College
   London, and the Weizmann Institute, Israel is on investigating the ways
   in which teachers can demonstrate accomplished teaching in a specific
   domain of science and on the teacher learning that is generated through
   continuing professional development (CPD) programmes that lead towards
   such practice. The interest lies in what processes and inputs are
   required to help secondary-school science teachers develop expertise in
   a specific aspect of science teaching. It focuses on the design of the
   CPD programmes and examines the importance of an evidence-based
   approach through portfolio-construction in which professional dialogue
   paves the way for teacher learning. The set of papers highlights the
   need to set professional challenges while tailoring CPD to teachers'
   needs to create an environment in which teachers can advance and
   transform their practice. The cross-culture perspective adds to the
   richness of the development and enables the researchers to examine
   which aspects are fundamental to the design by considering similarities
   and differences between the domains.

AB In this study our goal was to better understand the development of
   chemistry teachers who are involved in a continuous professional
   development (CPD) programme, focusing on using the inquiry approach in
   the chemistry classroom-laboratory, followed by protocols assembled in
   a portfolio that can be used to demonstrate evidence-based practice in
   chemistry teaching in the inquiry laboratory. Fourteen experienced
   chemistry teachers participated in a workshop, coordinated by three CPD
   providers from the Department of Science Teaching, at the Weizmann
   Institute of Science. The meetings, lasting about three hours, were
   conducted once a month. Of the fourteen teachers, some were videotaped
   while conducting inquiry-type experiments in their classes, and were
   interviewed immediately afterwards. Based on the findings, we conclude
   that the CPD programme contributed to the professional development of
   the teachers. The teachers became more reflective and more aware of
   their practice. In addition, we observed a change in their pedagogical
   knowledge and content knowledge regarding the inquiry teaching.
   Moreover, their anxiety concerning the implementation of the programme
   was reduced significantly throughout the year.

TI An evidence-based continuous professional development programme on
   knowledge integration in physics: A study of teachers' collective
   discourse
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB We describe an evidence-based continuing professional development
   programme on knowledge integration (KI) for high-school physics
   teachers. Sixteen teachers participated in the year-long programme
   (about 40 face-to-face lessons and in-between computerised
   interactions). The teachers experienced the KI activities as learners
   and then engaged in an 'evidence-based' approach, i.e. implemented the
   activities in their classes, collected data about teaching and
   learning, analysed the data, and discussed the evidence
   collaboratively. The study investigated teachers' learning throughout
   the programme as reflected in the collective discourse held during the
   meetings by examining the ideas that were raised and how they were
   influenced by the evidence-based approach. The discourse reflects
   progress in teachers' tendencies and abilities to continuously find out
   about individual students' learning, and to adopt 'learner-centred'
   views. These views of teaching and learning related to the importance
   and legitimacy of students' learning from peers, the need to listen
   carefully to students' ideas and reflections, and the need to use a
   variety of methods for investigating students' learning in order to
   plan teaching. Importantly, teachers realised the need for the KI
   activities and their advantages. They were more willing to adapt them
   with required customisations. The evidence-based approach triggered two
   central reasoning patterns influencing teachers' learning: contrasting
   expectations with facts and making generalisations. Towards the end of
   the programme, the teachers realised the general importance of the
   evidence-based approach, beyond its support of the particular domain of
   KI, and they concluded that examination of their practice is a powerful
   tool for enhancing their teaching as well as their students' learning.

TI Learning about Teachers' Accomplishment in 'Learning Skills for
   Science' Practice: The use of portfolios in an evidence-based
   continuous professional development programme
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID EDUCATION
AB The study in this paper was carried out in the framework of an
   evidence-based continuous professional development (CPD) programme in
   which teachers documented evidence about their practice in a portfolio.
   The context of the CPD was related to the 'Learning Skills for Science'
   (LSS) programme, which advocates the incorporation of high-order
   learning skills and capabilities into science school curricula, in
   addition to content knowledge. The LSS comprises high-order scientific
   communication skills such as information retrieval, scientific reading,
   scientific writing, listening and observing, information
   representation, and knowledge presentation. The main goal was to study
   what can be learned from evidence-based portfolios about teachers' LSS
   practice. More specifically we studied the dimensions and levels of
   teachers' practice, the profiles of teachers' accomplishment, and their
   ability to present evidence about their practice. We analysed 12
   teachers' portfolios (34 pieces of evidence) using a diagnostic tool
   that reflected the various dimensions of teachers' accomplishment in
   LSS practice: P: Perceptions of LSS instruction; M: Model of
   instruction; T: Using learning materials; A: Assessment; I: Influence
   in the school system; E: Evidence preparation. For each of these
   dimensions we identified a hierarchy of levels on a scale of 1-5. The
   diagnostic tool revealed diverse LSS multidimensional professional
   profiles which demonstrated strong and weak aspects in teachers'
   performance. We concluded that evidence-based portfolios about
   teachers' practice can serve as tools for assessment of teachers'
   accomplishment (for example, for accreditation purposes) and as an
   authentic resource for customising professional development programmes
   to the needs of individual teachers.

ID STUDENTS; EDUCATION; GENETICS
AB This paper reports on the use of portfolios in a continuing
   professional development programme to advance teachers' skills in their
   pedagogy of argumentation. The programme adopted a cyclical process of
   expert input-teacher practice-sharing practice, in order for
   professional learning to include reflective analysis of growing
   accomplishment. Accomplishment was initially defined according to
   previous research and development on the teaching of argumentation, but
   was redefined during the programme as teachers shared practice and
   discussed their achievements. Portfolios were used to help teachers
   apply their learning, collate evidence of their accomplishment and
   share reflective analysis of practice with other colleagues on the
   programme. The paper includes extracts of two teachers' portfolios:
   these provide evidence of each teacher's developing accomplishment in
   the teaching of argumentation. Portfolios are idiosyncratic and are
   constructed according to an individual teacher's motivations,
   interpretations and situations. Teachers need structure and guidance in
   creating purposeful portfolios that enhance reflective practice.

ID SCIENCE-EDUCATION; KNOWLEDGE; TEACHERS; REFORM
AB A programme of professional development was designed consisting of 20
   hours of workshops plus in-school activities. The implementation of new
   pedagogy was supported by teachers bringing examples of their work in
   the classroom to the workshops for discussion and reflection. The
   purpose of this study is to explore factors that influenced what
   teachers took from the professional development programme and how they
   used it in their own classrooms. It focuses on how the teachers'
   perceived needs were affected by the programme and how the
   implementation of new pedagogy was affected the level of in-school
   support. Data were collected to evaluate the expertise of the teachers
   early in the programme, their learning through the programme and
   factors that affected their learning. These data included
   tape-recordings of selected discussions during workshops, field notes
   of the workshops, classroom evidence collected by the teachers and
   portfolios constructed from it, and interviews with teachers after the
   programme had finished. The results indicate that success in learning
   from the programme was affected by two key factors: how teachers'
   perceptions of their needs interacted with the learning opportunities
   offered by the programme and how the level of in-school support
   affected the introduction of new pedagogy in the classroom. Unless both
   factors were positive learning from the professional development
   programme was variable.

TI Evaluation of professional development: Deploying a process-focused
   model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This evaluation used a change transition model to explore the processes
   of development of a three-phase professional programme devised by two
   teams of researchers to support teachers' expertise in six domains of
   science teaching. The full programme operated over two years.
   Interviews with developers at the end of each phase (21 interviews) and
   with teachers at the end of phases two and three (11 interviews) formed
   the main data set. The four features of the change transition model -
   trigger, vision, conversion, maintenance - were used as a framework for
   analysis of the qualitative data. Four themes emerged as contributing
   to the success of the process of development of the programme:
   establishing a shared vision of the goals of the programme and its
   outcomes; maintaining flexibility in implementing the phases and
   details of the programme; negotiating common understanding with
   participants; and ensuring fruitful collaboration in planning and
   implementation. The demands of attending to all of these features
   should not be underestimated in any successful developmental process.
   The evaluation therefore provides evidence for additional guidance in
   future collaborative professional development.

TI Networked learning a relational approach: weak and strong ties
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE community; dialogue; networked learning; networks; weak ties
AB In this paper, we explore the idea of weak ties in networked learning.
   We go back to the original conception of the strength of weak ties and
   relate this to Bakhtin and a dialogic understanding of networked
   learning. These theoretical ideas are applied to the examination of two
   networked settings in which educational leaders exchange ideas and have
   the potential to create knowledge. We examine these networks from the
   point of view of the overall pattern of interaction and from an
   interest in the kinds of dialogues engaged in by participants in the
   network. We identify an area for further research in a comparison of
   the dimensions of links that appear to be weaker in these networks,
   those concerning affective aspects of the relationship, with those
   concerned with the sharing of knowledge which appear to be relatively
   well developed. We suggest that presence and proximity become forms of
   telepresence and tele-proximity and rely more heavily on interactional
   means to achieve identity formation. Finally we note that knowledge is
   negotiated and the marks of its personal and situated origin are
   essential parts of the exchange through dialogue.

DE communities of practice; networked identities; networks; social forms

AB In this paper we take up a critique of the concept of Communities of
   Practice (CoP) voiced by several authors, who suggest that networks may
   provide a better metaphor to understand social forms of organization
   and learning. Through a discussion of the notion of networked learning
   and the critique of CoPs we shall argue that the metaphor or theory of
   networked learning is itself confronted with some central tensions and
   challenges that need to be addressed. We then explore these theoretical
   and analytic challenges to the network metaphor, through an analysis of
   a Danish social networking site. We argue that understanding meaning
   making and 'networked identities' may be relevant analytic entry points
   in navigating the challenges.

AB This article explores the social network of learning beyond a
   functional understanding of social relations. It describes and
   interprets the realities of networked learning within a particular
   postgraduate course in an English university setting. It draws
   attention to some of the limitations of the increasing interest in the
   use of social network analysis (SNA) alongside content analysis of
   recent studies in the field of networked learning. In particular, SNA
   has been used to analyse response relations among participants in
   online discussions in terms of, for example, density and centrality. It
   argues for a different approach to a network of learning, focusing on
   the relational effects of multiple technical and social arrangements
   and engagements beyond the response relations the online environment is
   able to capture and store. This approach emphasizes network processes
   rather than network structures.

AB Computers are increasingly widespread, influencing many aspects of our
   social and work lives, As we move into a technology-based society, it
   is important that classroom experiences with computers are made
   available for all students. The purpose of this study is to examine
   pre-service teachers' attitudes towards computers. This study extends
   the technology acceptance model (TAM) framework, with subjective norm
   and facilitating conditions acting as external variables. Results shows
   that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and subjective norm
   were significant determinants of pre-service computer attitudes.
   Facilitating conditions did not influence computer attitude directly
   but through perceived ease of use. These findings demonstrate that
   social norm and facilitating conditions are potential variables that
   may be used to extend the TAM for research on computer attitudes.

AB In this study, 364 first-year physics students were randomly assigned
   to one of four online multimedia treatments on Newton's First and
   Second Laws of Motion: (1) the 'Exposition', a concise lecture-style
   presentation; (2) the 'Extended Exposition', the Exposition with
   additional interesting information; (3) the 'Refutation', the
   Exposition with common misconceptions explicitly stated and refuted; or
   (4) the 'Dialogue', a student-tutor discussion of the same material as
   in the Refutation. Students were tested using questions from mechanics
   conceptual inventories before and after watching the multimedia
   treatments. Results show the Refutation and Dialogue produced the
   greatest learning gains, with effect sizes of 0.79 and 0.83,
   respectively, compared with the Exposition. Students with low prior
   knowledge benefited most, however high prior knowledge learners were
   not disadvantaged by the misconception-based approach. The findings
   suggest that online multimedia can be greatly improved, promoting
   conceptual change in students with all levels of experience, by
   including a discussion of misconceptions.

DE change; conditions; ICT; learning; newly qualified teachers; tools
ID INFORMATION; TECHNOLOGY
AB The overarching aim of this study is to investigate how newly qualified
   Rwandan teachers can contribute to the creation of theoretical and
   practical knowledge for professional development with information and
   communication technology (ICT). Questionnaires, focus groups and
   interviews were used for data collection. The findings show that novice
   teachers are motivated to acquire ICT and that they succeed in
   situations where school administrators grant easy access to computers.
   The novice teachers expressed a strong desire to be trusted and be
   allowed time to use computers and related skills in their learning and
   teaching. These views are discussed in terms of learning conditions
   created in schools so that participants become active, responsible and
   committed practitioners. We assume that such attitudes can be a model
   for their future roles in fostering change in social practice. For
   example, this study shows that gender equity becomes an aspect of
   change in an ICT-learning environment, which creates new opportunities
   for continuous education. To achieve this, as revealed by the findings,
   there is a need to develop school-based curricula, appropriate pedagogy
   and teacher professional development in the area of ICT literacy, which
   allows the teachers to develop a critical mind to the new tools.

AB We explain certain learning difficulties in computer science education
   as resulting from a clash between the students' culture as computer
   users and the professional computing culture. We propose the concept of
   fertile zones of cultural encounter as a way of overcoming these
   learning difficulties. This pedagogical approach aims to bridge the gap
   between cultures by designing interventions that are appreciated by
   members of both cultures, yet also guide the student to engage in the
   practices of the professional culture. The learning difficulties are
   demonstrated by a detailed analysis of episodes taken from an advanced
   high school computer science course in concurrency. We show that
   fertile zones of cultural encounter can be successful in significantly
   improving learning of this subject.

TI The seeds of time: Why classroom dialogue needs a temporal analysis
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID DISCOURSE; SCIENCE
AB The process of teaching and learning in school has a natural long-term
   trajectory and cannot be understood only as a series of discrete
   educational events. Classroom talk plays an important role in mediating
   this long-term process, and in this article I argue that more attention
   should be given to the temporal dimension of classroom dialogue, both
   empirically and theoretically, if we are to appreciate how children
   gain an education from their classroom experience. I explore this topic
   using data from recent applied, interventional research in United
   Kingdom primary schools and examine how classroom talk is used to
   represent past shared experience, carry ideas forward from one occasion
   to another, approach future activities, and achieve learning outcomes.
   The article ends with a discussion of the theoretical, methodological,
   and educational implications of making this kind of temporal analysis.

AB Multiracial youth activism groups, based in working class and poor
   neighborhoods, seek to improve social conditions by organizing
   grassroots campaigns. Campaigns such as these, which require
   sophisticated planning, organizing, and advocacy skills, are noteworthy
   not just for their political impact, but also because of the insights
   they provide about learning environments outside of school. In this
   study I adopted Rogoff's (2003) theory of guided participation as a
   lens through which to analyze adult approaches to working with youth
   and how these approaches relate to opportunities for youth to
   participate in social action. Drawing on 2 years of ethnographic
   fieldwork in 3 multiracial activism groups, I found that adults managed
   tensions between youth empowerment principles and the task demands of
   campaigns in 3 distinct ways: facilitation, apprenticeship, and joint
   work. This analysis is relevant to educators who wish to support youth
   participation in mature social practices and researchers interested in
   elective learning environments.

TI The use of immersive virtual reality in the learning sciences: Digital
   transformations of teachers, students, and social context
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES

AB This article illustrates the utility of using virtual environments to
   transform social interaction via behavior and context, with the goal of
   improving learning in digital environments. We first describe the
   technology and theories behind virtual environments and then report
   data from 4 empirical studies. In Experiment 1, we demonstrated that
   teachers with augmented social perception (i.e., receiving visual
   warnings alerting them to students not receiving enough teacher eye
   gaze) were able to spread their attention more equally among students
   than teachers without augmented perception. In Experiments 2 and 3, we
   demonstrated that by breaking the rules of spatial proximity that exist
   in physical space, students can learn more by being in the center of
   the teacher's field of view (compared to the periphery) and by being
   closer to the teacher (compared to farther away). In Experiment 4, we
   demonstrated that inserting virtual co-learners who were either model
   students or distracting students changed the learning abilities of
   experiment participants who conformed to the virtual co-learners.
   Results suggest that virtual environments will have a unique ability to
   alter the social dynamics of learning environments via transformed
   social interaction.

AB Our main goal in this study was to determine whether the use of
   computer animation and illustration activities in high school can
   contribute to student achievement in molecular genetics. Three
   comparable groups of eleventh- and twelfth-grade students participated:
   the control group (116 students) was taught in the traditional lecture
   format, whereas the experimental groups received instructions that
   integrated a computer animation (61 students) or illustration (71
   students) activities. We used three research instruments: a
   multiple-choice questionnaire; an open-ended, written questionnaire;
   and personal interviews. Five of the multiple-choice questions were
   also given to students before they received their genetics instruction
   (pretest). We found that students who participate in the experimental
   groups improved their knowledge in molecular genetics compared with the
   control group. However, the open-ended questions revealed that the
   computer animation activity was significantly more effective than the
   illustration activity. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that
   it is advisable to use computer animations in molecular genetics,
   especially when teaching about dynamic processes; however, engaging
   students in illustration activities can still improve their achievement
   in comparison to traditional instruction. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals,

AB The national science standards, along with prominent researchers, call
   for increased focus on scientific argumentation in the classroom. Over
   the past decade, researchers have developed sophisticated online
   science learning environments to support these opportunities for
   scientific argumentation. Assessing the quality of dialogic
   argumentation, however, has proven challenging. Existing analytic
   frameworks assess dialogic argumentation in terms of the nature of
   students' discourse, formal argumentation structure, interactions, and
   epistemic forms of reasoning. Few frameworks, however, connect these
   assessments to conceptual quality. We present an analytic framework for
   assessing argumentation in online science learning environments that
   relates levels of opposition with discourse moves, use of grounds, and
   conceptual quality. We then apply the proposed framework to students'
   dialogic argumentation within a representative online science learning
   environment to investigate the framework's potential affordances as
   well as to assess issues of reliability and appropriateness. The
   results suggest that the framework offers significant affordances and
   that it also offers high interrater reliability for trained coders. The
   applicability of the framework for offline contexts and future
   extensions of the framework are discussed in light of these results.

AB This study examines teacher-student interactions and selected student
   gender differences with volunteer boys and recruited girls in a
   technology class. The participants were teachers and triads of Girls
   and boys in single-gender sections of a technology course where the
   students built, designed features for, and programmed Lego robots. We
   analyzed transcripts of videotapes of instruction; teacher, parent, and
   student interviews; student questionnaires; and final programs. Girls
   and boys differed in a number of ways, and teachers explained their
   differing interactions with boys and Girls as functional responses to
   those differences. At the end of the course, volunteer boys and
   recruited girls did not differ in achievement or interest in the
   course. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study described the conceptual understandings of 50 early
   childhood (Pre-K-3) preservice teachers about standards-based lunar
   concepts before and after inquiry-based instruction utilizing
   educational technology. The instructional intervention integrated the
   planetarium software Starry Night Backyard (TM) with instruction on
   moon phases from Physics by Inquiry by McDermott (1996). Data sources
   included drawings, interviews, and a lunar shapes card sort. Videotapes
   of participants' interviews were used along with the drawings and card
   sorting responses during data analysis. The various data were analyzed
   via a constant comparative method in order to produce profiles of each
   participant's pre- and postinstruction conceptual understandings of
   moon phases. Results indicated that before instruction none of the
   participants understood the cause of moon phases, and none were able to
   draw both scientific moon shapes and sequences. After the instruction
   with technology integration, most participants (82%) held a scientific
   understanding of the cause of moon phases and were able to draw
   scientific shapes and sequences (80%). The results of this study
   demonstrate that a well-designed computer simulation used within a
   conceptual change model of instruction can be very effective in
   promoting scientific understandings. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   advanced students participated in the research. This study analyzes how
   students utilized thinking skills and science process skills
   characteristic of scientifically literate individuals to solve a
   robotics challenge. In addition, a pre/post test revealed that course
   participants increased their systems understanding, t (21) = 22.47, p <
   .05. It is argued that the affordances of the robotics environment
   coupled with a pedagogical approach emphasizing open-ended, extended
   inquiry prompts the utilization of science literacy-based thinking and
   science process skills and leads to increased systems understanding.

TI AI in training (1980-2000): Foundation for the future or misplaced
   optimism?
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Since the beginning of the use of technology to support training and
   learning there has always been the belief that such new technologies
   would be able to add value either by reducing costs or increasing
   effectiveness. The 1980s and early 1990s were a period of enormous
   optimism as to the promise that such technology could bring. The
   governments of Europe and the US were generous in their funding of
   research in this area. In Europe research and development programmes
   such as ESPRIT, DELTA, RACE, ERASMUS and COMETT, to name only a few,
   funded a wealth of initiatives aimed at advancing the use of
   technology. At the margins of the early initiatives was the belief that
   AI must have a part to play in these developments. This paper reviews
   the early initiatives and suggests reasons why the potential for the
   use of AI in education and training has never been truly fulfilled.

AB Previous research has established a close link between students'
   conceptions of learning and approaches to learning. Until recently,
   only a few quantitative studies have investigated the relationship
   between high school students' conceptions of learning science and the
   approaches they adopt to learning science. This study sought to address
   this gap in the literature by assessing these possible relationships
   empirically through the development of two questionnaires: The
   Conceptions of Learning Science (COLS) questionnaire and the Approaches
   to Learning Science (ALS) questionnaire. Four hundred and seventy-four
   Taiwanese high school students were administered the COLS questionnaire
   and the ALS questionnaire. Results were entered into a structural
   equation model to elicit structural relations between students'
   conceptions of and their approaches to learning science. Overall,
   findings revealed that students holding constructivist conceptions of
   learning science tended to employ deep approaches to learning science.
   Conceptions of learning science such as "testing" and "calculate and
   practice" were also found to have effects on the surface approaches to
   learning science; the conceptions of learning science as "applying" and
   "understanding and seeing in a new way" had noticeable effects on deep
   approaches to learning science. This study employed quantitative
   methods to confirm further the structural relations existing between
   conceptions of learning science and the motives and strategies employed
   in learning science. Implications for implementing the study's findings
   into the context of the real-world classroom are discussed. (c) 2007

AB Youth from low-income, minority backgrounds have often been
   marginalized from introductory courses, advanced study and careers in
   physics. Cultivating student agency may have the potential to improve
   access for diverse groups of learners. However, the implications of
   this lens for student learning have been minimally examined in the
   physics education literature. In this ethnographic study situated in a
   ninth-grade conceptual physics classroom, I discuss students' critical
   goals-the intentions, motivations, and desires for change that youth
   held. These critical goals were related to learning, voice, and
   participation in relationships and the world. I also describe how
   student goals demonstrate the idea of "critical subject-matter agency"
   in physics: students positioning themselves as powerful learners
   envisioning subject knowledge as a tool for change in their own lives
   and world. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Two disparate research programs have addressed the challenge of
   instructional multimedia design. One, based on cognitive load theory,
   has focused on ways of reducing unnecessary cognitive load during
   instruction to free up resources for learning. The other, based on
   constructivism, has centered on interactive multimedia, allowing
   students to build their own knowledge. Attempting to build on both
   bodies of literature, in this study, we investigated techniques that
   can raise the useful cognitive load engendered with linear multimedia.
   Participating online from home, students were pre- and posttested
   around a short multimedia intervention that explained Newton's first
   and second laws. In Experiment 1, students who watched a video dialogue
   involving alternative conceptions reported investing greater mental
   effort and achieved higher posttest scores than students who received a
   standard lecture-style presentation. In Experiment 2, two additional
   multimedia treatments were evaluated to assess the role of
   instructional time and the method of addressing alternative
   conceptions. In all, 272 students participated in the experiments.
   Interviews suggest that students adopted a more active approach to
   understanding the material if alternative conceptions were raised. In
   addition, students who watched the dialogue judged themselves to be
   similar to the student in the multimedia. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals,

AB Students studying in government-run schools in rural India possess much

   narrative account of an ethnographic exploration of such students as
   they attempted to learn about electricity in an eighth-grade classroom
   in a government-run schools in a village in India. The paper shows how
   students having a rich experience with household electric circuits
   attempt, in a contingent and situated manner, to negotiate their role
   as students and participate in the school science discourse. The
   students' actions expressed agency that was contingent, situated, and
   aimed at selective appropriation of school science discourse for their
   own purposes. Such expressions of student agency indicate rich
   possibilities for meaningful learning of science in rural schools in
   India provided school science is made relevant for their lives and
   concerns. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID ASTRONOMY; BELIEFS; PHYSICS
AB To explore the ways in which teacher-guided and student-centered
   instructional approaches influence students' conceptual understanding
   of seasonal change, we designed a technology-enhanced learning (TEL)
   course to compare, by means of concept maps, the learning outcome of
   students in two groups: a teacher-guided (TG) class (with whole-class
   presentations) and a student-centered (SC) class (with individual
   online learning). The participants were two classes of second-year
   senior high school students in Taiwan. Overall, the results showed that
   most students developed a deep and accessible understanding of the
   reasons for the seasons after undergoing experiences provided by the
   TEL course. More importantly, it was found that, in this
   technologically enhanced environment. the student-centered approach was
   more effective than the teacher-guided approach in altering students'
   alternative conceptions of seasonal change (F=28.05, p < 0.001), The
   conceptual evolution of students in the two groups was plotted and
   compared. These plots indicated that, first of all, the cognitive
   processes of contextualization and sense making helped students
   re-examine their old ideas about the phenomena, leading them to
   generate alternative conceptions and undergo both positive and negative
   conceptual change. The student-centered approach allows students to
   more freely test their own hypotheses in the processes of exploration
   and modeling, and thus move from assimilatory to properly scientific
   explanations. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

SO SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID KNOWLEDGE; TEXTBOOKS
AB Curriculum analysis, modification, and enactment are core components of
   teacher practice. Beginning teachers rely heavily on curriculum
   materials that are often of poor quality to guide their practice. As a
   result, we argue that preservice teachers need to learn how to use
   curriculum materials for effective teaching. To address this concern,
   the authors conducted a study in which three teacher educators taught
   elementary science methods courses incorporating a major focus on
   curriculum analysis and modification based on Project 2061
   Instructional Analysis Criteria. Analysis of pre - post assessments,
   classroom artifacts, classroom dialogue, and postcourse interviews
   indicated that preservice teachers accurately applied and appropriated
   a modest set of criteria whose intended meanings most closely matched
   their own understandings, were most closely aligned with their own
   goals and criteria, or were made accessible through systematic use and
   attention within the methods sections. However, many did not find the
   materials analysis criteria useful or comprehensible and based their
   curricular decisions on their own criteria. Furthermore, some
   preservice teachers resisted engaging in these practices that may have
   seemed too analytical, inauthentic, and destabilizing. These findings
   pointed us toward a revised theoretical framework and new approaches to
   better support preservice teachers' effective participation with

AB This study investigated the effects of collaboration mode and group
   composition during a computer-mediated collaborative (CMC) program. Six
   intact sections of a computer literacy course were assigned to either a
   face-to-face or a virtual, online collaboration treatment condition.
   Groups consisted of homogeneous lower-ability, homogeneous
   higher-ability, or heterogeneous-ability pairs. The study examined the
   effects of collaboration mode and group composition on individual
   posttest performance, group project performance, collaborative
   interaction behavior, and attitudes towards the instruction. Results
   indicated that virtual dyads exhibited significantly more questioning
   behaviors and significantly better project performance than those who
   collaborated face-to-face. By comparison, students in the face-to-face
   condition performed significantly better on the individual posttest
   than those in the virtual online condition. Findings suggest that both
   virtual and face-to-face collaboration can be effective in achieving
   learning goals. However, consideration should be given to the
   collaborative structure of the lesson and the type of task in the
   design of CMC environments.

AB In the past few years, audience response technology (ART) has been
   widely adopted on college campuses, and is especially popular among
   instructors of large lecture classes. Claims regarding ART's benefits
   to students have received only limited empirical evaluation, and prior
   studies exhibit methodological limitations. The current study provides
   a multi-dimensional evaluation, utilizing a newly-developed measure,
   the Audience Response Technology Questionnaire (ART-Q). Data were
   provided at three points during a semester by undergraduate students (n
   = 854) who used ART in three large lecture university courses. Results
   indicate moderately positive evaluations of ART on some dimensions
   (e.g., ease of use, impact on attendance), with less positive
   evaluations on others (e.g., influence on preparation for class). These
   evaluations showed some variability across time of semester and course,
   but were not substantially affected by gender, ethnicity, or year in
   school. Findings are discussed with respect to the need for future
   research on instructors' techniques for using ART and their influence
   on student perceptions and outcomes.

TI Computer-based instruction's (CBI) rediscovered role in K-12: An

ID MOTIVATION; MEDIA
AB Patriot High School (PHS) adopted a remediation strategy to help its
   10th-grade students at risk of failing the Math portion of MCAS, the
   state's end of year competency exam. The centerpiece of that strategy
   was a computer-based instructional (CBI) course. PHS used a
   commercially available CBI product to align the course content with the
   competencies covered on the MCAS exam. This case study examines the
   overall effectiveness of the PHS strategies, and in particular, the
   role of CBI. Participant MCAS scores and CBI performance (measured by
   module-mastery data) are analyzed, and an interview with the course
   instructor is summarized. Finally, PHS scores were compared to the
   overall state MCAS scores for the same years. Overall scores of all
   10th graders increased significantly compared to their 8th-grade
   scores, students who participated in the CBI course improved more than
   the students who did not. The passing rate at PHS improved from 40% in
   1999 to 84% in 2001, compared to an improvement of from 47% to 75%
   statewide. A significant correlation was identified between the MCAS
   scores and the program usage data, with student CBI module mastery
   correlated with higher MCAS scores. Overall, the instructor was
   positive about the impact of the course and believed that the course
   gave many under-performers a chance to succeed when more traditional
   methods had failed. It seems likely that CBI contributed to PHS's
   success. Although we report herein on just one case, we argue that CBI
   might play an important a role in the high stakes test environment in
   the USA and eleswhere.

AB Cases have been used in education through a variety of methods, such as
   case written analysis, case discussion, and case development. Recent
   case definitions and uses have extended their traditional uses. In
   case-based reasoning, cases are considered to represent knowledge, and
   the use of cases is integral to an individual's problem-solving
   process. Case-based activity (CBA) builds on CBR research and theory,
   emphasizing the transition of novices toward experts' reasoning and
   applications. The purpose of this paper is to present the theoretical
   assumptions and principles for designing grounded, web-enhanced CBA.
   Findings from recent implementations and implications for design are
   presented.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB The study investigated the effects of three types of evaluation on
   preservice teachers' performance, knowledge and attitudes related to
   writing lesson plans that incorporate technology. Subjects were
   randomly assigned to one of the three treatment conditions:
   teacher-evaluation, self-evaluation or peer-evaluation. All groups
   completed three class periods of instruction on writing lesson plans,
   then each subject submitted his/her draft lesson plan. The drafts were
   evaluated by assigned evaluators (teacher, self or peer), who provided
   scores and written feedback on a 15-item rubric. Students then revised
   their lesson plans into final form. All three treatment groups improved
   their lesson plans significantly from draft version to final version,
   with the teacher-evaluation group showing significantly greater
   improvement and writing significantly better final lesson plans than
   each of the other two groups. Teacher-evaluation and self-evaluation
   groups had significantly higher scores on a knowledge-based posttest
   than the peer-evaluation group. Several suggestions are discussed for
   making further improvements in the self-evaluation and peer-evaluation
   processes.

AB The form factors of handheld computers make them increasingly popular
   among K-12 educators. Although some compelling examples of educational
   software for handhelds exist, we believe that the potential of this
   platform are just being discovered. This paper reviews innovative
   applications for mobile computing for both education and entertainment
   purposes, and then proposes a framework for approaching handheld
   applications we call "augmented reality educational gaming." We then
   describe our development process in creating a development platform for
   augmented reality games that draws from rapid prototyping,
   learner-centered software, and contemporary game design methodologies.
   We provide a narrative case study of our development activities spread
   across five case studies with classrooms, and provide a design
   narrative explaining this development process and articulate an
   approach to designing educational software on emerging technology
   platforms. Pedagogical, design, and technical conclusions and
   implications are discussed.

AB This paper describes how two related e-learning initiatives have led to
   school-level virtual learning environment (VLE) adoption and
   commencement of several new teaching developments at the University of
   Southampton. These have engaged additional academic staff with online
   learning and increased the role of blended learning within the
   curriculum, in turn contributing to new strategies at the university
   level. The first e-learning project was the joint Information Systems
   Committee/National Science Foundation-funded DialogPLUS project, and
   the second, a collaborative online masters programme. Barriers to
   embedding have been both technical and human, but among critical
   success factors, we especially identify the impetus provided by
   external funding, the size and composition of the project teams and, to
   a lesser degree, the creation of demonstrator materials. The specific
   details of VLE choice and learning object design have proved less
   significant. This work has been undertaken in collaboration with other
   schools in Southampton and other institutions within the Worldwide
   Universities Network.

TI A stakeholder approach to implementing e-learning in a university
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes the most recent phase in a mature e-learning
   project, in the area of reusable learning objects, that has attempted
   to bring about technological and cultural change. Following an overview
   of the project and organisational context, an institutional change
   model is described that helps managers and stakeholders to identify
   critical interactions among processes and that emphasises the need to
   recognise interdependencies among technology, practice and strategy.
   Our model places a premium on informal change, feasibility and
   sequence. The rest of the paper is organised around three key themes
   that emerged from practitioner accounts of a recent phase of the
   project; these are institutional change and resistance, a model for
   good practice and working with students to change their experience. The
   research method for the work described in this paper was interpretive,
   and involved the first author's attempts to understand members of the
   project team's definitions and accounts of the situation. Thus the rich
   accounts were further augmented by an interpretive phase that drew on
   the explanatory power of our change model. We conclude by (1) proposing
   that the inclusion of different stakeholders, and particularly the
   student voice, has provided the catalyst for change within the three
   partners of the CETL, and (2) suggesting that the crucial factors in
   change implementation are the coordination and dynamic extension of
   informal change processes which already exist.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
AB With increasing international collaboration in the delivery of higher
   education e-learning programmes, the requirement for changes in
   institutional practice needs to be considered in relation to the
   creation of shared online resources. A group of academic and learning
   technologists involved in a US/UK project experimented with technology
   and a new cultural approach to creating learning material suitable for
   use in geography programmes on either side of the Atlantic. The
   methodology, called Collaborative Learning Activity Design was
   undertaken to develop a series of learning activities to support the
   use and understanding of the Global Positioning System. As a result of
   this study, effective communication, reliable and flexible technology
   and a robust, iterative methodology were identified as critical factors
   for successful outcomes. These outcomes included learning materials
   that are readily redeployable in other institutions and
   cross-fertilisation of ideas and knowledge to produce higher quality
   resources. The experiences of designing and developing
   multi-institutional learning materials from the viewpoint of
   practitioners at the University of Leeds are discussed in this paper.

AB Blended learning, the combination of traditional face-to-face teaching
   methods with authentic online learning activities, has the potential to
   transform student-learning experiences and outcomes. In spite of this
   advantage, university teachers often find it difficult to adopt new
   online techniques, in part because institutional practices are still
   geared to support more traditional approaches. This paper describes how
   a project, funded to support international collaboration to enhance
   learning and teaching in Geography, has allowed a university to explore
   models for change. It briefly examines the associated issues of sharing
   and repurposing resources; it reflects on the impact of the project on
   local strategy, and the importance of sustaining the collaborations and
   approaches to learning and teaching after the funding is completed.

DT Article
AB The joint Information Systems Committee and the National Science
   Foundation programme, Digital Libraries in the Classroom (DLiC),
   addresses implications for the learning of the revolution in scholarly
   communication. What are the obstacles to undergraduates "writing" on
   and for the Internet'? Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) is a partner
   in one of the DLiC-funded projects, Spoken Word. At GCU the focus was
   on the practical demonstration of the implications and potential for
   learning of a remote electronic library extremely and extensively rich
   in culturally significant multimedia; the archives of the British
   Broadcasting Corporation. This paper considers one significant
   objective-embedding the developments generated in the project. It
   considers the reactions of major stakeholders to the attempts of the
   project team to raise institutional awareness of developments and
   pursue a strategy to induce change. This account is interim; the
   project has a 5-year life, from 2003 to 2008.

TI Critical success factors for e-learning and institutional change - some
   organisational perspectives on campus-wide e-learning
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID HIGHER-EDUCATION; TECHNOLOGY
AB Computer technology has been harnessed for education in UK universities
   ever since the first computers for research were installed at 10
   selected sites in 1957. Subsequently, real costs have fallen
   dramatically. Processing power has increased; network and
   communications infrastructure has proliferated, and information has
   become unimaginably accessible through the Internet and the World Wide
   Web. However, perhaps because higher education institutions are
   resistant to change, educational technology in universities has not
   managed to match the ubiquity of technology in everyday life. The
   reasons for differences between everyday experiences and those of
   higher education may lie in higher education practice. Higher education
   practice reflects the wider agendas of institutions manifested through
   their organisation, structure, culture and climate. These factors may
   particularly impact upon the potential for higher education to embrace
   and manage change in its educational activities, especially
   technology-enhanced learning such as blended learning and e-learning.
   This paper briefly reviews the progress of educational technology, then
   identifies critical success factors for e-learning through an
   organisational perspective derived from studies of six UK higher
   education institutions.

AB A writing process of five stages, setting the topic and goals, planning
   the outline, organising the structure, building the content, and
   reviewing, is proposed to guide hypermedia authoring. To explore the
   effects of the system designed with writing-process guidance, this
   study enrolled 108 seventh graders at a junior high school as
   experimental subjects. Results of the experiment show that
   writing-process guidance does indeed help in the presentation of
   students' web page creations. This experiment also explored the
   differences in web page creations between different genders. Results
   show that creations of male students are better than those of female
   students.

ID TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL; BEHAVIOR; USAGE; FIT
AB Factors affecting the student use of a course management system in a
   web-enhanced course are investigated using the technology acceptance
   model. Represented in the present study is the second phase of the
   analysis, with a focus on the causal relationship of subjective norms
   to student attitudes towards WebCT and their effect on three dependent
   variables: (1) end-of-course grades; (2) online frequency; and (3)
   future preference to take a web-enhanced class over a face-to-face
   course. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the measures
   of the two independent variables across three time periods. Findings
   suggest that the proposed model fits the data well and that it is
   useful to model student attitudes and perceived social pressure to
   understand certain student outcomes. Further recommendations for
   researchers and practitioners are addressed.

TI Educational design as a quest for congruence: The need for alternative
   learning design tools
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB There is a common predicament faced by educational designers, that is,
   the lack of learning design tools for nontraditional pedagogics of
   learning. Because of this lack of alternatives, educational designers
   often use traditional design tools (such as task analysis) in contexts
   where nontraditional learning activities (such as collaborative
   projects) are desired. Because the learning goals of objectivist and
   alternative epistemologies differ, the designed instructional/learning
   activities do not match the original goals or desired learning
   outcomes. It is argued that learning design should be understood of as
   a quest for congruence between learning epistemologies and designs.
   This paper proposes an analytical framework to help identify the
   congruence or lack thereof of a learning design. The framework consists
   of: (1) the employed epistemology and desired learning outcome, (2)
   focus of analysis, (3) focus of design and (4) the design process. It
   is hoped that this framework will provide a lever for developing design
   tools that are more congruent with alternative pedagogics.

ID MEDIA
AB The main purpose of this study was to identify the effects of two major
   components (ie, video and group discussion) of problem-based video
   instruction (PBVI) on college students' learning. To achieve this
   purpose, this study examined whether or not PBVI can improve learner
   satisfaction, comprehension and retention by comparing the results from
   three dependent variables in PBVI with two other kinds of instruction:
   (1) problem-based text instruction (PBTI) and (2) PBVI without group
   discussion.
   According to the findings, there were significant differences in
   learner satisfaction, comprehension, and delayed retention between PBVI
   and PBTI groups, whereas there were no significant differences in
   learners' satisfaction, comprehension, and delayed retention between
   PBVI and PBVI without group discussion. This study implies that PBVI in
   college courses have the potential to enhance student satisfaction,
   comprehension and delayed retention.

AB This paper explores the possibility of bringing e-learning to African
   universities through collaborative networks of public-private
   partnerships. It is envisaged that this approach will solve the dual
   problem of infrastructural barriers and weak ICT policies. As
   technology is used more in education, the teachers' roles are
   increasingly integrated with those of support staff, administrators and
   technical staff. The needs of e-learning environments suggest the
   viability of multistakeholder networks to share expertise and resolve
   issues related to training needs. The paper concludes that
   collaboration networks that include c-learning sponsors, policy makers,
   telecommunication network service providers and educators are required
   to solve the problems of online education in Africa.

   Effects on the production of instructional materials
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
AB Designers and producers of instructional materials lack a common design
   language. As a result, producers have difficulties translating design
   documents into technical specifications. The 3D-model is introduced to
   improve the stratification, elaboration and formalisation of design
   documents. It is hypothesised that producers working with improved
   documents (n = 8) show a more efficient translation process and more
   satisfaction with the design documents than producers working with
   traditional documents (n = 8). As expected, in the improved documents
   group, a higher agreement was found between the design documents and
   the technical specifications, which also required less time and less
   perceived cognitive load for their production. There were no
   differences in satisfaction with the design documents. The study shows
   that designers, working with the 3D-model, are able to improve design
   documents, resulting in a better translation process.

AB The purpose of this study is to understand in what ways a
   technology-enhanced learning (TEL) environment supports learning about
   the causes of the seasons. The environment was designed to engage
   students in five cognitive phases: Contextualisation, Sense making,
   Exploration, Modeling, and Application. Seventy-five high school
   students participated in this study and multiple sources of data were
   collected to investigate students' conceptual understandings and the
   interactions between the design of the environment and students'
   alternative conceptions. The findings show that the number of
   alternative conceptions held by students were reduced except for the
   incorrect concepts of "the length of sunshine" and "the distance
   between the sun and the earth." The percentage of partial explanations
   held by students was also reduced from 60.5 to 55.3% and the percentage
   of students holding complete scientific explanations after using Lesson
   Seasons rose from 2.6 to 15.8%. While some students succeeded in
   modeling their science concepts closely to the expert's concepts, some
   failed to do so after the invention. The unsuccessful students could
   not remediate their alternative conceptions without explicit guidance
   and scaffolding. Future research can then be focused on understanding
   how to provide proper scaffoldings for removing some alternative
   concepts which are highly resistant to change.

AB Inquiry is seen as an integral part of science education in the USA;
   however, few American science programs explicitly focus on the higher
   order thinking skills that are the precursors to inquiry. In this
   paper, Australian researchers report the result of using a version of
   the Cognitive Acceleration through Science Education (CASE) program in
   a school district in Oregon (USA) to address teacher-identified
   concerns about student competence in scientific inquiry. The
   substantial effect of CASE on British children's cognitive development
   and scholastic achievement has been demonstrated convincingly since its
   inception in the United Kingdom in 1981. The Oregon CASE project was
   not a mere replication of the original British CASE research: different
   instruments were employed, and both the measures of cognitive level and
   student achievement were Rasch-calibrated. The Oregon CASE teachers
   received comparatively less professional development than did their
   British counterparts. Neither did they deliver the entire intervention.
   The results of the study suggest that many of the benefits of CASE
   still apply when the intervention is conducted in a sub-optimal
   setting. Cognitive growth was apparent in participating students and
   high correlations were found between cognitive level and results in
   some state-mandated tests.

   were carried out with science education specialists and program
   coordinators at all institutions which offer primary teacher education
   or secondary science teacher education. The interviews focused on
   practices in relation to program structures, science content studies,
   science methods studies and links to science-related school projects or
   to science business/industry. A large number of innovative practices
   were described. In addition, several case studies were carried out,
   which focused on particular innovations. The study identified several
   aspects of science teacher education which were of concern.

AB A lack of congruency between the teaching and learning of science and
   the student's personal worlds has long been recognised by the
   international science education community as an issue deserving space
   in the research agenda. The purpose of this study was to explore the
   diversity of student reactions when subcultures such as family,
   community peers, and personal worldviews are considered along side the
   subculture of school science. Two-hundred and fifty students from urban
   and provincial schools in the northeastern region of Colombia (South
   America) participated. From this group, 18 students were interviewed.
   It was observed that students adopt a compartmentalisation of knowledge
   that is evident as both an avoiding strategy in the classroom and as a
   mechanism to differentiate between the natural world of their everyday
   situations and the one portrayed by a Westernised science instruction
   in the classroom. The findings reflect how multiple worldviews
   correlate with student frameworks as implanted by school science.

AB The paper reports on part of a large-scale study aimed at examining
   students' perceptions of teacher-student interactions. This paper will
   report on a study utilising mixed methodology in 12 Queensland primary
   classrooms. After the students' perceptions were established, the
   teachers, through a consultative process, developed strategies to
   change the students' perceptions of their classroom over a 3 month
   period. The paper reports on what strategies these teachers utilised
   and what changes in students' perceptions resulted. The classroom
   teachers were interviewed about the change in students' perceptions,
   what changes they had sought to promote in their classrooms, and what
   they felt had been achieved in their classrooms. The study found that
   students were able to articulate what changes the teacher had
   implemented, what their reaction was to these changes and their
   perception of the classroom environment as a result of these
   implemented strategies.

AB Students are generally known to memorise and regurgitate chemical
   equations without sufficient understanding of the changes that occur at
   the particulate level. In addition, they often fail to recognise the
   significance of the symbols and formulas that are used to represent
   chemical reactions. This article describes an evaluation of the ability
   of 65 Grade 9 students (15-16 years old) from a Singapore secondary
   school to describe and explain seven types of chemical reactions using
   macroscopic, submicroscopic and symbolic representations. The study was
   conducted over nine months using a supplementary teaching program with
   particular emphasis on the use of multiple levels of representation to
   describe and explain chemical reactions. Students' proficiency in the
   use of multiple levels of representation was assessed at the end of the
   course using a two-tier multiple-choice diagnostic instrument that was
   previously developed by the authors. In order to evaluate the efficacy
   of the instructional program, the instrument was also administered to
   another group of 76 students who were not involved in the supplementary
   instructional program. The efficacy of the program was evident from the
   significantly improved scores on the diagnostic instrument of the
   former group of students. In addition, several student conceptions in
   the use of multiple levels of representation were identified that could
   assist teachers in their planning and implementation of classroom
   instruction.

AB This study investigates the effect of cooperative learning (jigsaw)
   versus individual learning methods on students' understanding of
   chemical equilibrium in a first-year general chemistry course. This
   study was carried out in two different classes in the department of
   primary science education during the 2005-2006 academic year. One of
   the classes was randomly assigned as the non-jigsaw group (control) and
   other as the jigsaw group (cooperative). Students participating in the
   jigsaw group were divided into four "home groups" since the topic
   chemical equilibrium is divided into four subtopics (Modules A, B, C
   and D). Each of these home groups contained four students. The groups
   were as follows: (1) Home Group A (HGA), representing the equilibrium
   state and quantitative aspects of equilibrium (Module A), (2) Home
   Group B (HGB), representing the equilibrium constant and relationships
   involving equilibrium constants (Module B), (3) Home Group C (HGC),
   representing Altering Equilibrium Conditions: Le Chatelier's principle
   (Module C), and (4) Home Group D (HGD), representing calculations with
   equilibrium constants (Module D). The home groups then broke apart,
   like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and the students moved into jigsaw
   groups consisting of members from the other home groups who were
   assigned the same portion of the material. The jigsaw groups were then
   in charge of teaching their specific subtopic to the rest of the
   students in their learning group. The main data collection tool was a
   Chemical Equilibrium Achievement Test (CEAT), which was applied to both
   the jigsaw and non-jigsaw groups The results indicated that the jigsaw
   group was more successful than the non-jigsaw group (individual
   learning method).

AB Looking after pets provides several benefits in terms of children's
   social interactions, and factual and conceptual knowledge about these
   animals. In this study we investigated effects of rearing experiences
   on children's factual knowledge and alternative conceptions about
   animals. Data obtained from 1,541 children and 7,705 drawings showed
   very strong bias towards rearing vertebrates and a general ignorance of
   invertebrates. Experiences with rearing animals significantly
   contributed to children's knowledge about animal's internal organs.
   Children who reported keeping two or more animals acquired better
   scores in our study than children keeping only one or no animals.
   Moreover, the misclassification of invertebrates was not influenced by
   children's experiences of keeping animals. Although girls showed better
   knowledge about the anatomy of animals and actually kept more animals
   than did boys, they also more frequently misclassified invertebrates by
   drawing bones inside the bodies of the animals, hence allocating them
   to the vertebrates. We propose that science activities with animals
   should be more focused on rearing invertebrates and improving
   children's attitudes and knowledge about them.

AB Our research objectives focused on monitoring (i) students' activities
   during experimental teaching phases in an out-of-school gene technology
   laboratory, and (ii) potential relationships with variables such as
   work group size and cognitive achievement. Altogether, we videotaped 20
   work groups of A-level 12th graders (n = 67) by continuous recording of
   their laboratory-work phases. Subsequent analysis revealed nine
   categories characterizing the students' most relevant activities.
   Intra-observer and inter-observer objectivity as well as reliability
   scores confirmed the good fit of this categorization. Based on the
   individual time budgets generated, we extracted four clusters derived
   from students' prevalent activities. A cross-tabulation of two cluster
   analysis methods independently used showed a high level of agreement.
   Clusters were labelled as (i) "all-rounders" (members of which applied
   similar portions of time to the main activities), (ii) "observers"
   (members dominating activity focused on in-group observation of the
   laboratory work), (iii) "high-experimenters" (members predominantly
   engaged in specific hands-on activities), and (iv) "passive students"
   (members mainly engaged in activities with no experimental relation).
   Particularly, we found members of Clusters 1 and 2 in four-person work
   groups while members of Clusters 3 and 4 were prevalent in three-person
   groups. During the educational intervention, students of all clusters
   improved their cognitive achievement on a short-term and a long-term
   schedule. However, only the "all-rounders" revealed a high level of
   persistent (long-term) knowledge with no decrease rate at all. We draw
   conclusions with respect to work group sizes as well as to
   organizational aspects of experimental lessons.

AB This study investigated the efficacy of extracurricular science
   intervention in promoting students' science learning performance and
   attitudes toward science. The Junior High School Student Questionnaire
   (JSSQ) was used to measure attitudes toward science, sexist attitudes
   and perceptions of the classroom learning environment. Twenty-eight
   eighth graders from single parent families were participants in the one
   group pre-test post-test study. It was found that they made significant
   progress on most of the measurements. Additional qualitative results of
   interview and observation were used for triangulation and consideration
   of findings. The initial findings from the approach of multi-methods
   reveal a positive impact on the students' learning of science.

ID ONLINE COURSE; SCIENCE; MICROSCOPY; RESOURCES
AB This study compared students' investigations with an atomic force
   microscope and viruses in real-time synchronous and asynchronous
   learning environments. Student interactions with scientists (live
   videoconference versus email) were examined to see whether
   communication patterns were different for the different modes of
   instruction. Students' knowledge of viruses, microscopy, and nanoscale
   science was compared for asynchronous (n = 44) and synchronous
   treatments (n = 41). Eight teams of four students were video-recorded
   and student discourse was analyzed. Data sources included students'
   questions, pre-instruction and post-instruction knowledge assessments,
   and written descriptions of the investigations. Results showed that
   students in the asynchronous group asked significantly more inquiry and
   interpretation questions of scientists and fewer questions about the
   scientists than students in the synchronous group. Both groups showed
   significant gains in knowledge of virus types and morphology. Students
   in the asynchronous group made significantly more written notations
   about what they learned from the investigations than students in the
   synchronous group.

AB The roles of science in society and the nature of science are the focus
   of many science curricula. Current views about these two aspects of
   science have largely been informed by the history of scientific
   development. This article uses the outbreak of severe acute respiratory
   syndrome - a recent health scare - as a case study to explore the roles
   of science and their relationship with the nature of science and
   societal factors. The review provides deeper insight into the
   difficulties that are encountered in fulfilling these roles,
   particularly those that relate to the nature of science. This review
   has implications for both school and public science education.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

DT Article
ID SCIENCE-EDUCATION; STUDENTS
AB This article reports on educational design research concerning a
   learning and teaching strategy for cell biology in upper-secondary
   education introducing systems modelling as a key competence. The
   strategy consists of four modelling phases in which students
   subsequently develop models of free-living cells, a general
   two-dimensional model of cells, a three-dimensional model of plant
   cells, and finally they are engaged in formal thinking by modelling
   life phenomena to a hierarchical systems model. The strategy was
   thought out, elaborated, and tested in classrooms in several research
   cycles. Throughout the field-tests, research data were collected by
   means of classroom observations, interviews, audio-taped discussions,
   completed worksheets, written tests, and questionnaires. Reflection on
   the research findings eventuated in reshaping and formalizing the
   learning and teaching strategy, which is presented here. The results
   show that although acquiring systems thinking competence at the
   metacognitive level needs more effort, our strategy contributed to
   improving learning outcomes; that is, acquisition of a coherent
   conceptual understanding of cell biology and acquisition of initial
   systems thinking competence, with modelling being the key activity.

DE physical science; inquiry; college/university; classroom research
ID PHYSICS; KINEMATICS; VELOCITY
AB We present results of an investigation of university students'
   development of mathematical models of motion in a physical science
   course for preservice teachers and graduate students in science and
   mathematics education. Although some students were familiar with the
   standard concepts of position, velocity, and acceleration from physics
   classes, most students had difficulty using these concepts to
   characterize actual or hypothetical motions. Furthermore, some students
   developed their own nonstandard method of describing accelerated motion
   in terms of changes in the average velocity, from the start of the
   motion up to a given time. This is in contrast to the physics
   community's use of the acceleration construct, defined in terms of
   changes in the instantaneous velocity, to describe such motion.
   Although the change in average velocity is not typically identified as
   an important construct in traditional physics texts, some students
   found it intuitively appealing, and were able to use it successfully to
   describe and predict motion. We conclude that by focusing on standard
   constructs, and ignoring possible intuitive ways that students might
   view motion, standard kinematics instruction may miss an opportunity to
   maximize student understanding. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Interviews with representatives of nine municipal agencies involved in
   air-quality education were analyzed for concepts and skills perceived
   as important for citizens in addressing air-quality concerns.
   Interviewees focused mainly on general air quality-related
   understandings (60.2%), although cognitive skills (22.0%) and specific
   concepts (17.8%) were also mentioned. The major categories of desired
   air-quality understandings identified in interviews included sources,
   impact, detection, and transport of air pollutants. Identified
   cognitive skills focused on information-gathering and -evaluating
   abilities, enabling informed air-quality decision making. Eight
   Learning Goal Sets generated from interview data and validated via peer
   and member checks helped guide a content analysis of six undergraduate
   liberal arts chemistry textbooks. Overall, sampled chemistry textbooks
   supported the previously identified air-quality concepts and skills.
   However, few textbooks directly confronted interviewee-reported, air
   quality-related misconceptions and inabilities. Instructional and
   research implications of these validated air-quality learning goals and
   subsequent textbook analyses are discussed. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals,

AB Students in undergraduate chemistry courses find, as a rule, topics
   with a strong mathematical basis difficult to master. In this study we
   investigate whether such mathematically related problems are due to
   deficiencies in their mathematics foundation or due to the complexity
   introduced by transfer of mathematics to a new scientific domain. In
   the investigation we exposed a group of students to a chemistry
   instrument based on the Nernst equation in electrochemistry, and an
   equivalent group of students to a similar mathematics instrument in
   which the questions were stripped of all chemistry context. Both tests
   contained items requiring algebraic as well as graphical skills.
   Students experienced few problems with the algebraic questions in both
   the chemistry and mathematics tests. Their graphical construction and
   interpretation skills, on the other hand, are inadequate, as can be
   seen from the poor performance in both the mathematics and the
   chemistry results of the graphical question. Our conclusion is that the
   problem seems to lie at the mathematics side and is not due to the
   transfer of mathematics to an application. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals,

AB The case-based computerized laboratory (CCL) is a chemistry learning
   environment that integrates computerized experiments with emphasis on
   scientific inquiry and comprehension of case studies. The research
   objective was to investigate chemical understanding and graphing skills
   of high school honors students via bidirectional visual and textual
   representations in the CCL learning environment. The research
   population of our 3-year study consisted of 857 chemistry 12th grade
   honors students from a variety of high schools in Israel. Pre- and
   postcase-based questionnaires were used to assess students' graphing
   and chemical understanding-retention skills. We found that students in
   the CCL learning environment significantly improved their graphing
   skills and chemical understanding-retention in the post -with respect
   to the prequestionnaires. Comparing the experimental students to their
   non-CCL control peers has shown that CCL students had an advantage in
   graphing skills. The CCL contribution was most noticeable for
   experimental students of relatively low academic level who benefit the
   most from the combination of visual and textual representations. Our
   findings emphasize the educational value of combining the case-based
   method with computerized laboratories for enhancing students' chemistry
   understanding and graphing skills, and for developing their ability to
   bidirectionally transfer between textual and visual representations.

AB This study investigates the interaction between four pairs of high
   school students in a 7-week national research apprenticeship program.
   Each student was interviewed about perceptions of experiences working
   with a peer in the same setting, and the resulting stories were
   analyzed. Through discourse analysis of the interviews and interrelated
   analyses of data from journals and responses on pre- and postprograin
   questionnaires, three types of support were identified that students
   experienced to varying degrees: social-emotional, social-technical, and
   social-cognitive. It is concluded that social-cognitive support is best
   engendered if there is sufficient similarity of problems and processes,
   and ample room for different results and debate about interpretation.
   Additionally, the culture and reward system students work within (i.e.,
   classrooms) must encourage discussion of ideas and value an outsider's
   perspective, in recognition of the roles creativity, uncertainty, and
   ambiguity play in science. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This paper focuses on theory and research issues associated with the
   use of hypermedia technologies in education. It is proposed that
   viewing hypermedia technologies as an enabling infrastructure for tools
   to support learning-in particular learning in problem-based pedagogical
   environments involving cases-has particular promise. After considering
   research issues with problem-based learning related to knowledge
   transfer and conceptual change, a design framework is discussed for a
   hypermedia system with scaffolding features intended to support and
   enhance problem-based learning with cases. Preliminary results are
   reported of research involving a new version of this hypermedia design
   approach with special ontological scaffolding to explore conceptual
   change and far knowledge transfer issues related to learning advanced
   scientific knowledge involving complex systems as well as the use of
   the system in a graduate seminar class. Overall, it is hoped that this
   program of research will stimulate further work on learning and
   cognitive sciences theoretical and research issues, on the
   characteristics of design features for robust and educationally
   powerful hypermedia systems, on ways that hypermedia systems might be
   used to support innovative pedagogical approaches being used in the
   schools, and on how particular designs for learning technologies might
   foster learning of conceptually difficult knowledge and skills that are
   increasingly necessary in the 21st century.

AB A number of available resources offer guidance about hypermedia design
   strategies, many of which rely on principles of user-centered design.
   Many recent efforts, however, have focused more on developing
   learner-centered hypermedia. Learner-centered hypermedia is designed to
   help learners achieve their educational goals, rather than offer mere
   usability. Unfortunately, this endeavor is hamstrung by a lack of
   empirical research on the topic. Research conducted in my laboratory
   and others has provided some insight, however. It is now understood
   that several system and user characteristics influence outcomes of
   hypermedia-assisted learning (HAL). Among the most relevant factors are
   learners' levels of metacognition and prior knowledge, and the
   interaction between these factors and hypermedia structure. By
   capitalizing on this research, it is possible to create hypermedia that
   scaffolds learners in their quest to build knowledge and understanding.
   The present article draws from empirical findings to suggest hypemedia
   design strategies aimed at scaffolding learners engaged in HAL. These
   guidelines target learners' knowledge and metacognitive ability to
   structure hypermedia that maximizes learning potential.

AB Global comparisons of learning from hypertext/hypermedia and
   traditional presentation formats like text have yet failed to show
   major advantages concerning the effectiveness of hypermedia learning.
   Thus, it is proposed in the current paper to evaluate hypermedia
   environments more specifically with regard to their potential to
   implement and support well-defined learning approaches. According to
   this view, an effective hypermedia design needs to be based on thorough
   cognitive task analyses with regard to structures, processes, and
   resources that are required to benefit from a specific learning
   approach. This claim is illustrated by two experiments in which we
   explored the instructional potential of hypermedia environments for
   improving schema acquisition from worked-out examples. A cognitive task
   analysis was used to identify specific types of information comparisons
   that are crucial for successful schema induction and that might be
   effectively supported by suitably designed hypermedia environments. The
   experiments investigated two methods for enhancing comparison processes
   in hypermedia-assisted learning from worked-out examples, namely,
   elaboration prompts and an interactive comparison tool. Both methods
   improved performance for near-transfer problems. Ways of extending this
   task-analytical approach to facilitating far transfer are also
   discussed.

ID ITEM RESPONSE THEORY
AB Computer adaptive testing is the study of scoring tests and questions
   based on assumptions concerning the mathematical relationship between
   examinees' ability and the examinees' responses. Adaptive student
   tests, which are based on item response theory (IRT), have many
   advantages over conventional tests. We use the least square method, a
   well-known statistical method, to reach an estimation of the IRT
   questions' parameters. Our major goal is to minimize the number of
   questions in the adaptive test in order to reach the final level of the
   students' ability by modifying the equation of estimation of the
   student ability level. This work is a follow-up on Al-A'ali (2007). We
   consider new factors, namely, initial student ability, subject
   difficulty, number of exercises covered by the teacher, and number of
   lessons covered by the teacher. We compared our conventional exam
   results with the calculated adaptive results and used them to determine
   IRT parameters. We developed the IRT formula of estimating student
   ability level and had positive results in minimizing the number of
   questions in the adaptive tests. Our method can be applied to any
   subject and to school and college levels alike.

ID RELIABILITY
AB This study investigates differences in the partial scoring performance
   of examinees in elimination testing and conventional dichotomous
   scoring of multiple-choice tests implemented on a computer-based
   system. Elimination testing that uses the same set of multiple-choice
   items rewards examinees with partial knowledge over those who are
   simply guessing. This study provides a computer-based test and item
   analysis system to reduce the difficulty of grading and item analysis
   following elimination tests. The Rasch model, based on item response
   theory for dichotomous scoring, and the partial credit model, based on
   graded item response for elimination testing, are the kernel of the
   test-diagnosis subsystem to estimate examinee ability and
   item-difficulty parameters. This study draws the following conclusions:
   (1) examinees taking computer-based tests (CBTs) have the same
   performance as those taking paper-and-pencil tests (PPTs); (2)
   conventional scoring does not measure the same knowledge as partial
   scoring; (3) the partial scoring of multiple choice lowers the number
   of unexpected responses from examinees; and (4) the different question
   topics and types do not influence the performance of examinees in
   either PPTs or CBTs.

ID DESIGN-USE INTERFACE
AB Education in the United States is becoming increasingly standardized,
   with the standards being initiated at the national level and then
   trickling down to the state level and finally the local level. Yet,
   this top-down approach to educational standards carries with it
   significant limitations, such as loss of local autonomy and
   restrictions on the creativity of educational software designers. This
   paper reports findings from a study of the design and use of frog
   dissection simulations used in middle school and high school biology
   classes. The paper builds on the existing literatures on science and
   technology standards in education, using interviews, participant
   observation, and content analysis guided by grounded theory. The
   results highlight the ways that top-down educational standards
   constrain science teachers and software designers. The discussion
   presents an alternative to the top-down regime of educational
   standards, namely, a bottom-up approach of standardization from below.
   Finally, the conclusion argues that local control of educational
   experiences in the form of standardization from below can improve upon
   the traditional regime of top-down standards.

ID TECHNOLOGY; PRESERVICE; ATTITUDES; EDUCATION; SCALES; ICT
AB Sandholtz, Ringstaff, & Dwyer (1996) list five stages in the
   "evolution" of a teacher's capacity for computer-based
   instruction-entry, adoption, adaptation, appropriation and
   invention-which hereafter will be called the teacher's computer-based
   instructional evolution. In this study of approximately six hundred
   junior high school science and mathematics teachers in Taiwan who have
   integrated computing technology into their instruction, we correlated
   each teacher's stage of computer-based instructional evolution with
   factors, such as attitude toward computer-based instruction, belief in
   the effectiveness of such instruction, degree of technological practice
   in the classroom, the teacher's number of years of teaching experience
   (or "seniority"), and the teacher's school's ability to acquire
   technical and personnel resources (i.e. computer support and
   maintenance resources). We found, among other things, that the stage of
   computer-based instructional evolution and teaching seniority, two
   largely independent factors, both had a significant impact on the
   technical and personnel resources available in their schools. Also, we
   learned that "belief" in the effectiveness of computer-based
   instruction is the single biggest predictor of a teacher's successful
   practice of it in the classroom. Future research therefore needs to
   focus on how we can shape teachers' beliefs regarding computer-based
   learning in order to promote their instructional evolution.

AB This study, using content analysis technique, examined the types of

   the types of social support provided by reciprocal discussions in an
   online forum. Results indicated that role conflict, inadequate teacher
   induction policies, lack of required technological infrastructure and
   technical support, and the status of computer subject in school
   curriculum were the most frequently mentioned problems. In addition,
   87.9% of the messages were identified as providing emotional support,
   while 3.1% messages were identified as providing instrumental support.
   It is concluded that content analysis technique provides an invaluable
   tool to understand the nature of communication and social interaction
   patterns among users in online environments. CMC in education should
   not only be considered to be a tool for content delivery and
   instructional interaction, but also a feedback mechanism and a platform
   for professional support, as well as an informal learning environment.

   narrowing the digital divide by providing a practicable e-learning
   option for the millions living outside the ambit of high performance
   computing and communication technology. The concept is introduced of a
   learning computer, a low bandwidth tool that provides a simplified,
   specialised e-learning environment which works with or without an
   internet connection. This concept is contrasted with the Learning
   Management System model widely adopted by universities, in which
   teaching material is accessed as web pages from a central repository.
   The development of an initial prototype and its field testing under
   realistic conditions is reviewed, and plans for future work outlined.

   validity of the assessment system used in a semi presential web-based
   course. The course uses an authentic assessment system that includes
   online forums, online tests, self-evaluations, and the assessment of
   e-learner processes and products by a tutor, peers, and an expert. The
   validity of the system was checked using internal and external
   criteria. The results show that the authentic assessment system
   addresses technical problems, especially regarding reliability of
   instruments. Some suggestions are proposed to strengthen authentic
   assessment in web-based courses and to test it.

AB The paper discusses the results of a research project based on the
   field testing of a course aimed at developing arithmetic problem
   solving skills in primary school pupils. The course was designed to
   incorporate e-learning techniques, including the use of ARI@ITALES
   authoring tools. These tools allowed the integration in the course of
   constructivist activities based on interaction with a set of different
   microworlds. The aims of the project were twofold: to analyse how the
   adopted approach and tools could help the teacher design and manage
   classroom activities integrating technology; and to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the ARI@ITALES tools for supporting pupils'
   acquisition of mathematical skills.

AB This study focused on the relationship between Kolb learning styles and
   the enduring time of online learning behaviors, the relationship
   between Kolb learning styles and learning outcomes and the relationship
   between learning outcomes and the enduring time of a variety of
   different online learning behaviors. Prior to the experiment, 104
   students majoring in Educational Technology completed Kolb's Learning
   Style Inventory (KLSI). Forty students were chosen to be subjects in an
   online learning experiment. Results indicated that there was a
   significant effect of Kolb learning style on the total reading time and
   total discussion time of the subjects. Although there was no
   significant effect between Kolb learning styles and learning outcomes,
   data from the experiment showed that the mean of learning outcomes of
   Convergers and Assimilators was higher than that of Divergers and
   Accommodators. There were two models of linear regression between
   learning outcomes and the enduring time of different online learning
   behaviors. Both of them were significant at the 0.001 level, and they
   accounted for 54.9% and 60.8% of the variance of the dependent
   respectively. The findings of this study were instrumental to
   instructors and moderators of online courses. First, instructors using
   online courses should seriously consider the diversity of learning
   styles when designing and developing online learning modules for
   different students. Second, they should provide a large number of
   electronic documents for students and give enough time to let them
   absorb knowledge by online reading. These could be effective methods to
   improve the quality of online courses.

TI In an economy for reusable learning objects, who pulls the strings?
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY

DT Article
DE reusable learning object; reconfigurability; course design; complexity;
   learning object economy; repositories
AB It seems a foregone conclusion that repositories for reusable learning
   objects (RLOs), based on common standards and supported by suitable
   search facilities, will foster a global economic market in the
   production of RLOs. Actual reuse will support producers of high-quality
   RLOs, and other producers will be unable to compete, i.e. competition
   within the market will implicitly define the qualities that are needed.
   This paper challenges the suggestion that this will occur. If the
   marked is defined as cost versus value, then the set of qualities that
   distinguishes RLOs from other educational software prohibits the
   development scalable search engines to search the repositories. At a
   more sophisticated level of market analysis, it is the needs of the
   producers, rather than the purchasers, that will define quality in the
   market. Any attempt to limit this imbalance will, paradoxically,
   require acceptance of alternative constraints that many may find hard
   to accept.

AB Design Based Research (DBR) is a new and still-emerging approach to
   research about design, learning, and allied areas. This article reports
   one designer's experiences within a DBR project. Whereas most reports
   of DBR focus on the outcomes of the design itself, the current paper
   offers a hermeneutical perspective by focusing on the personal
   narrative of the designer. Using Edelson's (2002) categories of
   learning as a basis for the discussion, the author reports the
   development of his own domain theories, design frameworks, and design
   methodology. Implications for other designers who would consider using
   personal narrative and hermeneutics are offered.

TI Artificial intelligence approach to evaluate students' answerscripts
   based on the similarity measure between vague sets
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE similarity functions; students' answerscripts; vague grade sheets;
   vague membership values; vague sets; index of optimism
ID FUZZY-SETS; GRADING SYSTEM; INFORMATION
AB In this paper, we present two new methods for evaluating students'
   answerscripts based on the similarity measure between vague sets. The
   vague marks awarded to the answers in the students' answerscripts are
   represented by vague sets, where each element u(i) in the universe of
   discourse U belonging to a vague set is represented by a vague value.
   The grade of membership of u(i) in the vague set (A) over tilde is
   bounded by a subinterval [t((A) over tilde)(u(i)), 1 - f((A) over
   tilde)(u(i))] of [0, 1]. It indicates that the exact grade of
   membership mu((A) over tilde)(u(i)) of u(i) belonging the vague set (A)
   over tilde is bounded by t((A) over tilde)(u(i)) = mu((A) over
   tilde)(u(i)) = 1 - f((A) over tilde)(u(i)), where t((A) over
   tilde)(u(i)) is a lower bound of the grade of membership of u(i)
   derived from the evidence for u(i), f((A) over tilde)(u(i)) is a lower
   bound of the negation of u(i) derived from the evidence against u(i),
   t((A) over tilde)(u(i)) + f((A) over tilde)(u(i)) = 1, and u(i) is an
   element of U. An index of optimism lambda determined by the evaluator
   is used to indicate the degree of optimism of the evaluator, where
   lambda is an element of [0,1]. Because the proposed methods use vague
   sets to evaluate students' answerscripts rather than fuzzy sets, they
   can evaluate students' answerscripts in a more flexible and more
   intelligent manner. Especially, they are particularly useful when the
   assessment involves subjective evaluation. The proposed methods can
   evaluate students' answerscripts more stable than Biswas's methods
   (1995).

ID SYSTEM
AB In this paper, we present a web-based educational setting, referred to
   as SCALE ( Supporting Collaboration and Adaptation in a Learning
   Environment), which aims to serve leaning and assessment. SCALE enables
   learners to (i) work on individual and collaborative activities
   proposed by the environment with respect to learners' knowledge level,
   (ii) participate actively in the assessment process in the context of
   self-, peer- or collaborative-assessment activities, (iii) work with
   educational environments, embedded or integrated in SCALE, that
   facilitate the elaboration of the activities and stimulate learners'
   active involvement, (iv) use tools that support the synchronous and
   asynchronous collaboration/communication and promote learners'
   interaction and reflection, and (v) have access to feedback components
   tailored to their own preferences. Also, learners have control on the
   navigation route through the provided activities and feedback
   components, personalizing in this way the learning process. The results
   revealed from the formative evaluation of the environment are positive
   and encouraging regarding the usefulness of the supported capabilities
   and tools.

AB Five eighth grade science classes of students in at a middle school
   were assigned to three treatment groups: those who individually concept
   mapped, those who collaboratively concept mapped, and those who
   independently used their study time. The findings revealed that
   individually generating concept maps on computers during study time
   positively influenced science concept learning above and beyond
   independent use of study time, but that collaboratively generating
   concept maps did not. Students in both individual and collaborative
   concept mapping groups had positive attitudes toward concept mapping
   using Inspiration software. However, students in the collaborative
   concept mapping group did not like working in a group. This study
   contributes to the limited body of knowledge concerning the comparative
   effectiveness of individually and collaboratively-generating concept
   maps on computers for learning.

AB This paper investigates the correlation between the quality of
   instructional design and learning outcomes for early childhood students
   in the online synchronous cyber classroom. Today's generation of
   e-learners has access to highly engaging and well-designed multi-media
   synchronous classrooms. However little data exists on what constitutes
   'good practice' in instructional design for online synchronous cyber
   lessons. The synchronous cyber classroom outperforms all other modes of
   instruction in enabling students to simultaneously integrate visual,
   auditory and kinaesthetic processes. The online synchronous cyber
   classroom provides learners with more authentic and engaging learning
   activities enabling higher levels of learning compared to purely
   asynchronous modes of self-paced learning. During 2001-2007 a group of
   students aged 5 to 8 years collaborated with their teacher at Brisbane
   School of Distance Education, Australia in a trial of online
   synchronous learning. The trial identified 'best practice' in the
   instructional design of synchronous lessons delivered through the
   Collaborative Cyber Community (3C) learning platform at the National
   Sun Yat-sen University, Taiwan. A guideline for 'best practice' in the
   instructional design of online synchronous cyber lessons for early
   childhood students has been developed and discussed.

TI Optional student use of online lecture resources: resource preferences,
   performance and lecture attendance
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE absenteeism; course management system; lecture resources; note taking
AB One of the most common uses of a course management system in the
   on-campus environment is to offer lecture resources to students. Few
   researchers have investigated how students use such resources. This
   study considers student use of lecture resources that offer a
   representation of the lecture presented (i.e. lecture outline, lecture
   summary, audio recording) and the relationship of the use of such
   resources to examination performance and attendance. The present
   research is argued to be an extension of research that investigated the
   benefits of providing students instructor notes conducted some 30 years
   ago. The Internet provides a practical way to apply some of these ideas
   and to collect data on the reaction of students to the opportunity to
   view lecture resources. Students made very little use of the audio
   recordings. We suggest audio recordings may be regarded by students as
   less efficient and less useful than text-based lecture summaries. The
   use of online lecture resources, lecture attendance, and examination
   performance were positively related. For one of three examinations,
   there was a significant negative interaction of note use and attendance
   in predicting examination performance providing some support for the
   hypothesis that students may be able to successfully compensate by
   viewing online lecture resources when unable to attend class. Because
   students in this study were not asked to explain their use of these
   resources, the present findings are regarded as speculative. However,
   given the interests of many practitioners in providing students lecture
   resources, the descriptive data and the relationships observed here
   encourage additional investigation.

ID COMMUNICATION; TECHNOLOGY
AB The purpose of this study is to provide guidelines for teachers to
   carry out cross-national educational projects in schools through the
   introduction of virtual environments as a means of reshaping
   classroom-based activities. The theoretical foundations of the study
   are rooted in computer supported collaborative learning and the
   community of learners model. The case of Euroland is discussed as a
   successful example of mixing a face-to-face community with a larger
   community, which populates a virtual space. The virtual space used in
   this project features two pieces of software - a discussion forum and a
   three-dimensional virtual world - each of which are considered to be
   complementary. Students (ranging from 9 to 14 years old) from seven
   schools located in two European countries (Italy and The Netherlands)
   participated in the project. The development of Euroland took place
   across three temporal phases. These are described through four
   indicators, considered as relevant practices that are easily observed.
   The first indicator relates to the use of tools embedded within the
   virtual environments, very exploratory in the first phase, becoming
   more and more integrated in the phases that follow. The second
   indicator relates to the quality of interaction with partners at a
   distance, initially based on a simple representation and awareness of
   them, ultimately becoming more precise and detailed. The third
   indicator relates to the development of a sense of belonging to a
   community, initially limited to the in-the-classroom community and then
   progressively extended to the virtual community as indicated by the
   increased amount of time devoted to navigation and online activities
   and an increased use in quoting instances of activities in online life.
   The final indicator refers more specifically to the range of
   educational strategies' teachers should use in such contexts. As
   results of the analysis of how the indicators are set during each
   phase, teachers' guidelines are established. Teacher guidelines are
   given by differentiating between in-classroom and online contexts with
   the aim of obtaining the best possible results in accomplishing a
   project-like Euroland.

TI The practitioner perspective on the modeling of pedagogy and practice
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING

DT Article
DE learning theory; models of practice; pedagogy and e-learning
AB The promotion of e-learning in policies internationally has led to
   questions about how best to employ technology in support of learning. A
   range of models has since been developed that attempts to relate
   pedagogy to technology. However, research into the effectiveness of
   such models in changing teaching practice is sparse, and work that
   compares these models to practitioners' own representations of their
   practice is absent. The study described here involved asking
   practitioners to model their own practice, and to compare these with a
   model developed by a government organization. Practitioners were adept
   at using existing models and repurposing them to suit their own
   context. Our research provided evidence of broad acceptance of the
   existing model with practitioners, but indicated that practitioners
   would take this tool and remodel it for their own contexts of learning
   to make it meaningful, relevant and useful to them.

AB Most of our students complete most of their written assignments using a
   word processor, but they are still asked to handwrite responses in an
   examination. It could be argued that they have not practiced this task
   and the validity of the assessment could thus be questioned. This paper
   explores the possibility of bringing computers into the traditional
   essay-examination context, describes an appropriate hardware and
   software configuration, and provides feedback from initial evaluations
   with students and their reactions to the idea. Some of the implications
   and equity concerns that need to be considered before a decision can be
   made to use computers in essay exams are also discussed.

AB Internet technology has offered opportunities to develop ongoing
   assessment systems for classroom-based evaluation - on a daily basis.
   In this study, the researcher developed a web-based, curriculum-based
   measurement system with dynamic features which could generate different
   types of mathematics probes, track students' progress and provide
   diagnosed information as well as instructional suggestions for
   teachers. This paper explores the effects of the system on students'
   mathematical achievements. A total of 134 third-grade students (9- to
   10-year-olds) in four classes participated. The teachers in all groups
   used the web-based curriculum-based measurement system with different
   types of curriculum-based measurement probes and growth modeling. The
   results indicated that the use of class-wide dynamic-growth modeling
   combined with mixed-type probes enabled the students to perform better
   than those using single-type probes. This outcome was not seen with the
   linear-growth modeling groups. The positive findings suggested that
   applying class-wide dynamic-growth modeling as well as the assessment
   of integrated mathematics competency in the instructional processes
   facilitated students' mathematics learning. Therefore, the web-based,
   curriculum-based measurement system was not only an assessment system,
   but also a tool for teachers to integrate instructional strategies
   based on curriculum-based measurement.

ID LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS; NETWORKS
AB The introduction of elearning often leads to an increase in the time
   staff spends on tutoring. To alleviate the workload of staff tutors, we
   developed a model for organizing and supporting learner-related
   interactions in elearning systems. It makes use of the knowledge and
   experience of peers and builds on the assumption that (lifelong)
   learners, when instructed and assisted carefully, should be able to
   assist each other. The model operates at two levels. At level 1,
   prospective peer tutors are identified, based on a combination of
   workload and competency indicators. At level 2, the thus identified
   prospective peer tutors become the actual tutors; this is performed by
   empowering them with tools and guidelines for the task at hand. The
   article will situate the model in networks for lifelong learning. For
   one kind of interactions, answering content-related questions, we will
   review a set of existing approaches and emerging technologies and
   describe our model. Finally, we will describe and discuss the results
   of a simulation of a prototype of the model and discuss to what extent
   it matches our requirements.

AB This paper presents a blended learning model in which the online
   component is not used to replace some of the traditional on-campus
   activities of a course but to introduce new teaching objectives that
   would not have been possible to achieve, because of class time
   limitations and the nature of the course. The instructional model was
   aimed at integrating a theoretical layer of visual literacy in a
   traditional practical photography course, using various online
   individual and collaborative activities. The paper presents the model,
   details the instructional design of the web-based elements and their
   integration with the practical on-campus activity, and summarises an
   evaluation study performed with three classes. We suggest that this
   double blending approach combining online theory with on-campus
   practice could be used to cope with similar instructional challenges in
   other subject matter domains.

DT Article
DE E-learning; higher education; Internet; academics
AB This article reports major themes emerging from 41 semi-structured
   interviews conducted with staff from one 'old' and one 'new' university
   in England about the use of the web in teaching and learning for
   campus-based students. The research set out to explore real-life
   instances of the use of the web in teaching and learning to determine
   the relationship between this reality and the rhetoric surrounding the
   use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in
   universities. The focus of this paper is the motivations and/or
   barriers to adopting the WWW in teaching and learning at the
   institutional and individual staff level. The paper concludes by
   stressing that while there may be great potential for the use of ICTs
   for some aspects of teaching and learning, adoption of these new
   technologies is not straightforward; and, in the cases studied here,
   the use of the web in teaching and learning neither appears to be
   radically transforming teaching and learning within the university, nor
   to be providing (or even regarded as) a ready solution to the problems
   the sector currently encounters.

   programme delivery (FPD) in post-compulsory education. We highlight key
   features of FPD, including explicit and implicit assumptions about why
   flexibility is needed and the perceived barriers and solutions to
   implementing it. Our model addresses issues in implementing FPD at
   three levels within institutions: institutional, operational, and
   teaching and learning management, supporting strategic alignment at all
   three levels. It has been used to analyse four case studies at the
   University of Dundee and the UHI Millennium Institute.

DT Article
DE retention; first-year experience; transition; orientation
AB Common Time (CT) was a structured programme designed to enhance the
   social and academic engagement of a growingly diverse student body on a
   new campus that draws its population from a low-socioeconomic area. As
   a voluntary and non-remedial programme, it incorporated a range of
   formal and informal activities and processes to engage students. CT
   operates across degree programmes and involves the collaboration of
   academics, librarians and support staff such as learning advisers.
   Interviews with students reveal that the CT strategy achieved the
   objectives for which it was designed: to facilitate faculty-student
   informal interaction, provide the opportunity for students to interact
   and develop relationships with their peers, and provide a range of
   activities that would assist students with their academic and
   intellectual development. Further evidence of its success is borne out
   by high and consistent attendance, the longevity of the programme and
   its adoption as a model at other institutions.

AB The Patchwork Text has emerged as one of the most influential
   assessment innovations in Higher Education in recent years. As an
   assessment strategy with the potential to engage a wide range of
   learners, the patchwork has enjoyed a rising profile in the range of
   teaching, learning and assessment methods developed in the context of
   the widening participation agenda. The present article reports on the
   use of the patchwork on a foundation degree programme in work-based
   education, delivered for professionals with a role in instruction or
   training but with no formal teaching qualification. The study explores
   the student experience of working with the Patchwork Text by drawing
   upon exit interviews, questionnaire responses and sample 'patches' from
   a group of 19 students training for a teaching qualification. Key
   themes in the student experience of patchwork are identified and
   recommendations are offered regarding the use of this assessment form
   with diverse cohorts of students in the expanding Higher Education
   sector.

AB This paper reports the findings of a study which observed students'
   (aged 10-11) use of technology during project-based learning activities
   in science. As part of the overall process of project-based learning,
   students used computer technology as a tool for collecting information,
   organising it and presenting it to their peers. Students conducted
   research (through guided research processes), interacted with peers,
   teachers and the community (through personal interviews and visits),
   and displayed their understanding of knowledge through the presentation
   of web-pages. The results of the study indicate that all of the
   students achieved their research goals. Students' learning outcomes
   were observed based on their achievements in relation to developing
   skills and ability to synthesise and elaborate knowledge, to engage in
   scientific exploratory tasks, and to use the technology for supporting
   and reporting their research work. Teacher's support in relation to
   providing coaching skills is crucial to students' success in a
   project-based setting.

DT Article
DE eportfolios; women; returners; employability; gender
AB In 2002 the UK Government produced a report highlighting the problems
   faced by women returning to employment in science, engineering and
   technology (SET) after a career break. In response to this report, a
   national strategy was developed, with funding from the UK's Department
   of Trade and Industry and the European Social Fund 'Equal' Programme,
   to address the issues highlighted by the report. One of the key parts
   of the strategy was the creation of a short (100 hours), online course
   by the Open University (UK) aimed at supporting and empowering women
   who were returning to employment in SET after a break. An ePortfolio
   forms an integral part of the course experience. This paper reports the
   experiences of the first group of 100 women who participated in this
   course. A range of data sources have been used to analyse the responses
   of participants to the course including questionnaires, emailed
   'critical incident' narratives, discussion board postings and telephone
   interviews. This paper draws on that evaluation research to discuss the
   perceptions that women scientists, engineers and technologists had
   about the usefulness of personal/professional development planning
   (PDP) and an ePortfolio in helping them re-enter employment, and their
   intentions to use it in future. Some of these findings can be
   generalised to other groups (either employed or not) who might benefit
   from a similar approach, i.e. developing an ePortfolio through a set of
   structured and guided e-learning activities.

AB In the past decade, researchers have attempted to develop
   computer-assisted learning and testing systems to help students improve
   their learning performance. Conventional testing systems simply provide
   students with a score, and do not offer sufficient information in order
   to improve their learning performance. It would be of more benefit to
   students if the test results could be critically analysed and hence
   learning suggestions could be offered accordingly. This study proposes
   an algorithm for diagnosing students' learning problems and provides
   personalised learning suggestions for Science and Mathematics courses.
   An intelligent tutoring, evaluation and diagnosis system has been
   implemented based on the novel approach. Experimental results on a
   Mathematics course have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach
   in enhancing students' learning performance, making it highly promising
   for further study.

TI Integrating culture in the design of ICTs
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Nationally and internationally, designers are challenged with meeting
   the needs of diverse populations, and they are faced with the dilemma
   of how to integrate culture in the design of information and
   communication technologies (ICTs). This paper reviews the literature in
   the fields of human-computer interaction and instructional design to
   argue that the present methods of integrating culture in design serve a
   limited scope of what culture can be in the design process. Two
   conclusions were drawn from this research. First, it is apparent that
   integrating culture in the design of ICTs serves a broader scope, from
   the generic or culture-neutral, to the specialised or culture-specific.
   Second, this review indicates that design has not caught up with
   technology and that to create for diverse audiences the process must be
   deliberate.

TI Team conflict in ICT-rich environments: Roles of technologies in
   conflict management
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CLASSROOM; SKILLS
AB This study looks at how an information and communication technologies
   (ICT)-rich environment impacts team conflict and conflict management
   strategies. A case study research method was used. Three teams, part of
   a graduate class in instructional design, participated in the study.
   Data were collected through observations of team meetings, interviews
   with individual members, plus analysis of electronic documents
   exchanged among team members.
   Findings indicate that all teams experienced conflict at some level and
   that conflict management strategies evolved over time. ICT played a
   dual role in the conflict management of teams. These technologies
   seemed to facilitate conflict management by offering a formal means of
   communication, by making communication more effective with minimal
   waste or unnecessary effort, and by creating opportunities for more
   thoughtful reactions, with chances for reflection on the content.
   However, ICT also aggravated conflict, specifically when strategies for
   use were imposed, when team members became blunt and forthright, and
   when misinterpretations occurred because of differing senses of urgency
   in replying to emails.

TI Effects of motivational and volitional email messages (MVEM) with
   personal messages on undergraduate students' motivation, study habits
   and achievement
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL
AB This study investigated what kind of supportive information can be
   effective in improving the situation where there were severe
   motivational challenges. Motivational and volitional email messages
   (MVEM) were constructed based on an integrated model of four theories
   and methods, which are Keller's ARCS model, Kuhl's action control
   theory, Gollwitzer's Rubicon model of motivation and volition, and
   Visser & Keller's strategy of motivational messages, and distributed
   with personal messages created based on audience analysis to a large
   undergraduate class. In order to examine the effects of the messages on
   motivation for the course, study habits (study time), and achievement
   (test grade), MVEM were sent to 30 students (Personal Message Group:
   PMG) with personal messages and to 71 students (Non-Personal Message
   Group: NonPMG) without personal messages. Results indicated that PMG
   showed a higher level of motivation, especially in regard to
   confidence, than NonPMG. Also, the mean test grade of PMG increased so
   that the initial difference of the test grade between the two groups
   significantly decreased. Although there was no difference between the
   two groups in study habits, the findings suggest that personal messages
   addressing specific individual problems raise the positive effects of
   MVEM constructed based on the integrated model. Future research
   directions are discussed.

TI The impact of computer-mediated interaction on distance learning
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ACADEMIC QUALITY; ANOVA DESIGNS; EFFECT SIZE; EDUCATION; PERCEPTIONS
AB Distance-learning courses were classified with regard to their use of
   computer-mediated interaction and the degree to which such interaction
   was integrated into the curriculum and the assessment regime. This
   produced four groups of courses varying according to their use of
   interaction and integration. The impact of interaction and integration
   was investigated in terms of their effects on students' performance,
   their perceptions of academic quality and their approaches to studying.
   In all three respects, variations within the groups of courses proved
   to be more important than variations between the groups. Interpretation
   of these results suggests that the adoption of interactive environments
   within computer-mediated learning may not be enough in itself to lead
   to positive learning outcomes. We found no evidence for this assumption
   in terms of students' completion rates, pass rates, grades, perceptions
   of the quality of their courses or approaches to studying. Large
   variations in the measured indicators were found between courses, and
   these appeared to be largely independent of the effects of interaction
   and integration. Courses may differ markedly with regard to how they
   make use of computer-mediated interaction and how this is integrated
   into the curriculum and the assessment regime. A case study approach is
   suggested as being more likely to identify the impact of specific
   designs based on computer-mediated interaction and to bring together
   the diverse student responses arising from the use of such interaction
   in their studies.

AB With the development of the Internet in the era of knowledge-driven
   economy, e-learning is experiencing rapid growth. The online learning
   course websites are drawing more attention as well. This research
   combines the innovation diffusion theory and the technology acceptance
   model, and adds two research variables, perceived system quality and
   computer self-efficacy to propose a new hybrid technology acceptance
   model to study students' behavioural intentions to use the online
   learning course websites. This research finds that compatibility,
   perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived system quality
   and computer self-efficacy were critical factors for students'
   behavioural intentions to use the online learning course websites. By
   explaining students' behavioural intentions from a user's perspective,
   the findings of this research help to develop more user-friendly
   websites and also provide insight into the best way to promote new
   e-learning tools for students.

ID STRATEGIES
AB This paper considers the ways in which the interactive whiteboard may
   support and enhance pedagogic practice through whole-class teaching
   within literacy and numeracy. Data collected from observations of
   whole-class lessons, alongside individual interviews and focus group
   discussions with class teachers and Initial Teacher Education students,
   has provided opportunities to consider the potential of such technology
   to facilitate a more creative approach to whole-class teaching. The
   data suggests that, in the first instance, the special features of
   information and communications technology such as interactivity,
   'provisionality,' speed, capacity and range enhance the delivery and
   pace of the session. This research seems to indicate that it is the
   skill and the professional knowledge of the teacher who mediates the
   interaction, and facilitates the development of pupils' creative
   responses at the interface of technology, which is critical to the
   enhancement of the whole-class teaching and learning processes.

ID COMPUTER EXPERIENCE; CHILDREN; SCHOOL; PERCEPTIONS; HOME; SEX
AB Digital games are evolving beyond the solitary context into a
   ubiquitous, social and collaborative experience. Addressing beliefs
   about technology and attitudes towards technology-mediated processes is
   fundamental to the successful implementation of any innovation. In
   collaborative gaming, attitude towards gaming influences learners'
   interactions along the domain, technology and community dimensions.
   Building on various seminal works, an instrument was developed for
   measuring four components of attitude towards gaming-affective
   components, perceived control, perceived usefulness and behavioural
   components. The survey, including 21 statements each scored on a
   5-point Likert scale, was used with a sample of college students to
   investigate the influence of gender and gaming competence on attitude
   towards gaming. The pedagogical implications of the different attitude
   components are discussed in relation to game design and to the
   different interactions triggered by the gaming context.

TI The specific involvement of verbal and visuospatial working memory in
   hypermedia learning
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID MULTIMEDIA; HYPERTEXT; COMPREHENSION; METAANALYSIS; TEXT
AB Many models have hypothesized that multimedia comprehension requires
   the concurrent processing of verbal and visuospatial information by
   limited information processing systems. However, in spite of the
   emphasis devoted to the concurrent processing of verbal and
   visuospatial information, little research has so far investigated the
   specific role played by verbal and visuospatial abilities in multimedia
   comprehension. The present paper aims to study the specific involvement
   of verbal and visuospatial working memory in multimedia learning.
   Ninety-two students (39 boys and 53 girls) from a middle school in a
   small city in the northeast of Italy, were asked to learn new
   information on the physical and social geography of Germany from a
   hypermedium. Participants were also required to perform a reading
   comprehension test, two short-term memory tasks, and two working memory
   tasks, which assessed either verbal or visuospatial memory. The results
   support the hypothesis that both verbal and visuospatial working memory
   sub-components play a role in hypermedium processing, but with specific
   and distinct functions: the performance in the verbal working memory
   task was able to predict the semantic knowledge children can derive
   from hypermedia learning. In contrast, visuospatial working memory
   seemed to have lower connections to the semantic knowledge children
   derived from a hypermedia document, whereas its role emerged in the
   ability to construct a representation of the document structure.

TI We!Design: A student-centred participatory methodology for the design
   of educational applications
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CHILDREN
AB The development of educational applications has always been a
   challenging and complex issue, mainly because of the complications
   imposed by the cognitive and psychological aspects of student-computer
   interactions. This article presents a methodology, named We!Design,
   that tries to encounter the complexity of educational applications
   development from within the participatory design framework. The
   methodology enables computer literate students and designers to
   cooperate in the design of applications that (1) enhance typical
   educational processes for which students have extensive experience in,
   such as note taking or assessment, and (2) are well-suited to the
   technological, social and cultural particularities of each educational
   environment. The methodology can be easily applied in real educational
   contexts and consists of two phases. During the first phase, students
   participate in short-duration design sessions where they formulate
   needs, tasks and interface prototypes for the educational application
   under examination. In the second phase, the designers systematically
   analyse and then integrate student suggestions. In order to evaluate
   the methodology, it was applied in the design of two educational
   applications: an electronic assessment environment and a course
   website. A total of 86 undergraduate informatics students participated
   in 22 4-hour design sessions. The methodology was evaluated by
   collecting students' responses through questionnaires and by
   introspection on the video recordings of the design sessions. The
   design sessions proved to be a very intriguing experience for the
   students while the methodology's products managed to respond to their
   personal needs and expectations in an efficient and effective way.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

ID EDUCATION; COMPETENCE; BEHAVIOR; MODEL
AB Future health care professionals will require self-directed learning
   skills. e-Learning is a tool to assist in this process and therefore
   there is a need to develop the capacity and readiness to utilise
   e-learning within educational programmes. The aim of this study was to
   determine if extra-curricular online referencing and anti-plagiarism
   lectures would be utilised and would ultimately improve 1st-year
   undergraduate health sciences students' performance in written
   assessments. A series of six online archived multimedia lectures
   (asynchronous) were offered. Adult learning theory principles guided
   the resource design. Pre- and post-testing of knowledge, attitudes and
   computer skills was carried out. In-person tutorials and online email
   support were also offered. Less than 36% (self-report) of students
   accessed the online resources. The poor uptake revealed in this study
   is consistent with a number of other studies. These findings indicate
   the need for more careful scrutiny of the learning theory applied in
   e-learning design. Prochaska's transtheoretical model is suggested as a
   framework with strong potential for e-learning initiatives.

   CONTEXT
AB This case study examines the motivational structure of a group of male
   students (n=10) in a grade 11 General Science class at an independent
   single-sex school. We approach the concept of motivation through the
   integration of three different theoretical approaches: sociocultural
   theory, future time perspective and achievement goal theory. This
   framework allows us to stress the dialectical interdependence of
   motivation, as expressed through individual goals, and the socially and
   culturally influenced origins of these goals. Our results suggest that
   the boys internalised the administrative description of the course as
   meeting a diploma requirement, which they expressed in their perception
   of the course as being for "non-science" people who "just need a
   credit." However, we also found situational changes in students'
   motivational structure towards more intrinsic orientations when they
   were engaged in topics with personal everyday and future relevance.
   These situational changes in students' goal structures illustrate that
   our participants did not internalise classroom and school goal messages
   wholly and, instead, selectively and constructively transformed these
   goal messages depending on their own motivational structure and
   beliefs. These results stress the importance of teachers scaffolding
   not only for conceptual learning but also for student motivation in
   science classes, especially those that purposefully teach towards
   scientific literacy.

AB Introductory electromagnetism is a central part of undergraduate
   physics. Although there has been some research into student conceptions
   of electromagnetism, studies have been sparse and separated. This study
   sought to explore second year physics students' conceptions of
   electromagnetism, to investigate to what extent the results from the
   present study are similar to these results from other studies, and to
   uncover any new forms of alternative conceptions. Data for this study
   came from 15 in-depth interviews. Three previously unreported
   alternative conceptions were identified in the study: 1) induced
   current varies proportionately with current in solenoid; 2) there must
   be contact between magnetic flux and the external coil in order for any
   emf to be induced in the coil; 3) coulombic or electrostatic potential
   difference is present in an induced electric field. These alternative
   conceptions were manifested in these students' explanations of
   electromagnetic phenomena presented to them during the interviews.

DE aesthetic experience; elementary school; Dewey; science learning
ID SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE; DEWEYAN PERSPECTIVE; EDUCATION; CLASSROOM; WORK
AB The role of aesthetic experiences for learning was examined in
   elementary school science. Numerous authors have argued for a science
   education also involving aesthetic experiences, but few have examined
   what this means empirically. Recordings of children's talk with each
   other and with the teacher during hands-on activities in nine different
   science units were made. How the children and teachers used aesthetic
   judgements and how these judgements were part of aesthetic experiences
   of the science assignments were analysed. For the analysis a pragmatist
   perspective was used, especially drawing on Dewey and the later
   Wittgenstein. The results showed how aesthetic judgements occurred in
   moments of anticipation and moments when the science activities were
   brought to fulfilment. In this way children used aesthetic judgements
   normatively about what belonged in science class and what to include
   and exclude. In this way aesthetic judgements were an important part of
   learning how to proceed in science class. In using aesthetic judgements
   the children also talked about their own place in science class and
   whether they belonged there or not. In this way aesthetic experience is
   tightly related to learning science as participation. Learning science
   also meant learning a special kind of aesthetics, that is, learning how
   to distinguish the science context from other contexts. The fact that
   children liked or disliked something outside school did not necessarily
   mean that it was experienced aesthetically in the same way in school,
   but needed to be re-learnt. What these results mean for science
   education is discussed at length. The connection between aesthetics and
   learning to observe is also briefly discussed.

AB Socio-scientific issues in class have been proposed in an effort to
   democratise science in society. A micro-ethnographic approach has been
   used to explore how students elaborate arguments on a socio-scientific
   controversy in the context of small group discussions. Several
   processes of group argumentation have been identified. Students'
   arguments were elaborated from scientific data, common ideas and
   epistemological and strategic considerations. Students' social
   interactions influenced the patterns of argumentation elaborated within
   the group discussions. Implications of this study for the teaching of
   socio-scientific issues in class are discussed.

AB Although researchers in higher education propose alternatives to
   traditional approaches to assessment, traditional methods are commonly
   used in college or university science courses. The purpose of this
   study was to explore the feasibility and validity of Prospective
   Science Teachers' (PSTs) concept maps as authentic assessment tools in
   a student-centred approach to describe the changes in the conceptual
   understanding of the PSTs in general chemistry laboratory
   investigations. After the PSTs (n=47) decided on important issues, such
   as who would assess their concept maps and what scoring strategy and
   criteria would be used, they practiced assessing their own and peers'
   concept maps during the first five laboratory investigations. They
   subsequently constructed and assessed pre- and post-laboratory concept
   maps in a student-centred approach consisting of self, peer, and
   instructor assessments for the five remaining laboratory
   investigations. The results of the study showed using pre- and
   post-laboratory concept maps as authentic assessment tools in a
   student-centred approach was valid and reliable for describing the
   conceptual understanding of the PSTs in a university general chemistry
   laboratory course. The results of individual interviews indicated most
   PSTs had positive views of their assessment practices in the laboratory
   course. This study also provides pedagogical implications for the
   training of science teachers.

AB This research involved naive physics learners who were interested in
   majoring in science or engineering. In a semester-long
   quasi-experimental study, open-ended pretests and weekly interviews
   were used to analyse the progressive development of students'
   conceptions relating to sound and wave motion. Semi-structured
   interviews were also conducted to elucidate: (1) how their conceptions
   developed from everyday conceptions to unclear scientific conceptions
   to scientific conceptions, and (2) their beliefs of physics knowledge.
   Despite efforts to enable these students to learn physics, the findings
   showed that only two out of ten students developed acceptable physics
   conceptions during the course that would enable them to pursue the
   subject to a higher level. Also, students' conceptual development was
   found to be related to their cognitive understanding and to
   epistemological beliefs of physics. Therefore, to facilitate naive
   physics learners' success in a general physics course, in addition to
   the acquisition of content knowledge, explicit emphasis needs to be
   placed on the nature of physics knowledge.

AB This study is part of a 5-year professional development intervention
   aimed at improving science and literacy achievement of English language
   learners (or ELL students) in urban elementary schools within an
   environment increasingly driven by high-stakes testing and
   accountability. Specifically, the study examined science achievement at
   the end of the first-year implementation of the professional
   development intervention that consisted of curriculum units and teacher
   workshops. The study involved 1,134 third-grade students at seven
   treatment schools and 966 third-grade students at eight comparison
   schools. The results led to three main findings. First, treatment
   students displayed a statistically significant increase in science
   achievement. Second, there was no statistically significant difference
   in achievement gains between students at English to Speakers of Other
   Language (ESOL) levels I to 4 and students who had exited from ESOL or
   never been in ESOL. Similarly, there was no significant difference in
   achievement gains between students who had been retained on the basis
   of statewide reading test scores and students who had never been
   retained. Third, treatment students showed a higher score on a
   statewide mathematics test, particularly on the measurement strand
   emphasized in the intervention, than comparison students. The results
   indicate that through our professional development intervention, ELL
   students and others in the intervention learned to think and reason
   scientifically while also performing well on high-stakes testing. (c)

AB Teacher practices are essential for supporting students in scientific
   inquiry practices, such as the construction of scientific explanations.
   In this study, we examine what instructional practices teachers engage
   in when they introduce scientific explanation and whether these
   practices influence students' ability to construct scientific
   explanations during a middle school chemistry unit. Thirteen teachers
   enacted a project-based chemistry unit, How can I make new stuff from
   old stuff?, with 1197 seventh grade students. We videotaped each
   teacher's enactment of the focal lesson on scientific explanation and
   then coded the videotape for four different instructional practices:
   modeling scientific explanation, making the rationale of scientific
   explanation explicit, defining scientific explanation, and connecting
   scientific explanation to everyday explanation. Our results suggest
   that when teachers introduce scientific explanation, they vary in the
   practices they engage in as well as the quality of their use of these
   practices. We also found that teachers' use of instructional practices
   can influence student learning of scientific explanation and that the
   effect of these instructional practices depends on the context in terms
   of what other instructional practices the teacher uses. (c) 2007 Wiley

AB Contextualizing science instruction involves utilizing students' prior
   knowledge and everyday experiences as a catalyst for understanding
   challenging science concepts. This study of two middle school science
   classrooms examined how students utilized the contextualizing aspects
   of project-based instruction and its relationship to their science
   learning. Observations of focus students' participation during
   instruction were described in terms of a contextualizing score for
   their use of the project features to support their learning.
   Pre/posttests were administered and students' final artifacts were
   collected and evaluated. The results of these assessments were compared
   with students' contextualizing scores, demonstrating a strong positive
   correlation between them. These findings provide evidence to support
   claims of contextualizing instruction as a means to facilitate student
   learning, and point toward future consideration of this instructional
   method in broader research studies and the design of science learning
   environments. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In this study we investigated junior high school students' processes of
   argumentation and cognitive development in science and socioscientific
   lessons. Detailed studies of the relationship between argumentation and
   the development of scientific knowledge are rare. Using video and audio
   documents of small group and classroom discussions, the quality and
   frequency of students' argumentation was analyzed using a schema based
   on the work of Toulmin (1958). In parallel, students' development and
   use of scientific knowledge was also investigated, drawing on a schema
   for determining the content and level of abstraction of students'
   meaning-making. These two complementary analyses enabled an exploration
   of their impact on each other. The microanalysis of student discourse
   showed that: (a) when engaging in argumentation students draw on their
   prior experiences and knowledge; (b) such activity enables students to
   consolidate their existing knowledge and elaborate their science
   understanding at relatively high levels of abstraction. The results
   also suggest that students can acquire a higher quality of
   argumentation that consists of well-grounded knowledge with a
   relatively low level of abstraction. The findings further suggest that
   the main indicator of whether or not a high quality of argument is
   likely to be attained is students' familiarity and understanding of the
   content of the task. The major implication of this work for developing
   argumentation in the classroom is the need to consider the nature and
   extent of students' content-specific experiences and knowledge prior to
   asking them to engage in argumentation. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This longitudinal study investigated the progression in junior high
   school (JHS) students' conceptions of the structure of matter while
   studying a new instructional approach dealing with "Materials." In
   particular, we studied the progression of students' learning along two
   dimensions: (a) the conceptual model; and (b) the context of
   application. Students were asked to draw the structure of several
   materials and to write their explanations about the structure of these
   materials in questionnaires administered five times during a 3-year
   period. Results indicate students' progression in their microscopic
   conceptualization of materials. Toward the end of the instruction about
   85% of the students used a microscopic model in their representations,
   and 36% were able to give a molecular model. About 83% of the students
   retained a microscopic model. Different profiles of JHS students'
   progression in the conception of the structure of matter were
   identified. The study suggests that a long-term development of the
   particulate model requires: (a) constructing a solid foundation of
   knowledge about microscopic structure of materials; and (b) a spiral
   instruction. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This is an interpretive case study seeking to develop detailed and
   comparative descriptions of how two groups of fifth-grade students used
   two different Computer-based Programming Environments (CPEs) ( namely
   Microworlds Logo and Stagecast Creator) during scientific modelling.
   The primary sources of data that were used in this 4-month study
   include videotaped students' group work and whole-class discussions,
   and the instructors' reflective journals. For the data analysis,
   contextual inquiry was used in conjunction with analysis of student
   conversation in order to gain better insight into students' activity
   and conversation patterns while working with CPEs. Findings highlight
   the differences in the ways that the students used the two CPEs in the
   context of developing models of natural phenomena with respect to three
   distinct phases that emerged from data analysis, which include student
   approaches to (i) planning, (ii) writing and debugging code, and (iii)
   using code to represent the phenomenon under study. Lastly, findings
   highlight which aspects of students work during the three phases can be
   productive for scientific modelling, proposing possible relationships
   between student work and CPE features.

AB The aim of this study is to understand the influences on chemistry
   professors' use of educational technology. For this, we use activity
   theory to focus on two university chemistry professors and the broader
   activity system in which they work. We analyse their beliefs and past
   experiences related to teaching, learning, and technology as well as
   other components of the activity system of teaching chemistry with
   understanding. We employ a qualitative methodology with
   phenomenological and symbolic interactionist perspectives. Our findings
   illustrate various contradictions within and between the components of
   the activity system. Those include the insufficient level of
   collaboration, reflection, and communication among faculty members,
   constraints for reform-based chemistry teaching, limitations of large
   class sizes, and "poor" design of technology-enhanced classrooms. We
   propose several possible resolutions to transform undergraduate
   chemistry education, including the effective utilization of
   technology-enhanced teaching strategies and building a more uniform
   culture of teaching within science content departments.

AB The cram school in Taiwan offers additional after-school instruction to
   enhance students' academic performance, and it provides a unique
   educational context to investigate students' perspectives toward
   learning. The purpose of this study was to explore 45 cram school
   students' (around 14 years old) conceptions of learning and learning
   science. The research data were gathered from interviews with each of
   the students, and the interview responses were further analyzed by a
   phenomenographic method. It was found that most of these students
   conceptualized learning or learning science as memorizing school
   knowledge, preparing for tests, or practicing tutorial problems and
   processing calculations. This study also revealed that about 76% of the
   students expressed coherent views between conceptions of learning in
   general, and those of learning science in particular. Further analyses
   of student interview responses suggested that the students held a
   quantitative view of learning (science) and they tended to atomize
   school knowledge while learning (science). Their motivation for
   learning was mainly driven by external factors, such as examination
   scores, and they probably employed a surface approach to learning.
   Moreover, their conceptions of learning or learning science might imply
   a dualist epistemology for the nature of knowing and knowledge. This
   study also showed some evidence that the special educational context of
   cram schools might guide students develop certain conceptions of
   learning, thus leading to particular study and motivational approaches.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

DT Article
ID WORTH 10000 WORDS; THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK; VISUAL-SEARCH; CONTOUR MAPS;
   MEMORY; VISUALIZATION; SYSTEMS
AB This study investigates the strategies and assumptions that college
   students entering an introductory physical geology laboratory use to
   interpret topographic maps, and follows the progress of the students
   during the laboratory to analyze changes in those strategies and
   assumptions. To elicit students' strategies and assumptions, we created
   and refined a topographic visualization test that was administered
   before and after instruction to 26 students during the first semester
   of the study and to 92 students during the second semester. To more
   deeply understand how students think about and conceptualize
   topographic maps, we focused on eight individual students who were
   interviewed about their pretest and posttest answers as well as
   videotaped during three laboratory sessions. We found that even
   students who claim never to have worked with topographic maps often
   perform impressively on their pretests by making useful assumptions
   about symbolic topographic information. Some students, however, begin
   with less productive assumptions that may be unfamiliar to some
   instructors ( e. g., thinking that the spacing of contour lines
   indicates elevation instead of slope). Initial success should not be
   misinterpreted, however, as an integrated understanding of topographic
   maps. Only in posttest interviews do most students express explanations
   integrating multiple normative assumptions. In addition to highlighting
   the strategies and assumptions that college students use to interpret
   topographic maps, we outline the implications of these findings for the
   design of learning objectives, curricular activities, and assessments
   for topographic lessons in introductory college geology courses and the
   training of future geoscientists.

ID MENTAL MODELS; REPRESENTATION; EXPERTS; SPACE
AB Scale is one of the thematic threads that runs through nearly all of
   the sciences and is considered one of the major prevailing ideas of
   science. This study explored novice and experienced teachers' concepts
   of spatial scale with a focus on linear sizes from very small
   (nanoscale) to very large (cosmic scale). Novice teachers included
   undergraduates in science teacher education and students enrolled in a
   Masters of Arts in Science Teaching Program. Experienced teachers
   included students enrolled in a Master of Science Program.
   Participants' knowledge of conceptual categories of size, scale
   accuracy, and experiences learning scale were assessed. Results showed
   both experienced and novice teachers were most accurate in their
   knowledge of human scale (1 m or body length) and both groups were more
   accurate with large scale than small scale. Experienced teachers held
   more accurate concepts of small-scale measurements such as the
   nanometre than novice teachers. There was evidence that being able to
   directly experience objects and distances influenced concepts of size
   and scale. The role of in-school and out-of-school experiences in
   developing concepts of scale is discussed.

AB Reform efforts in science education emphasize the importance of
   rigorous treatment of science standards and use of innovative
   pedagogical approaches to make science more meaningful and successful.
   In this paper, we present a learning-goals-driven design model for
   developing curriculum materials, which combines national standards and
   a project-based pedagogical approach. We describe our design model in
   the context of the Investigating and Questioning our World through
   Science and Technology (IQWST) project, which is developing a
   three-year coordinated series of middle grades science curriculum
   materials. From using this model in the development and enactment of
   the curriculum, we identified three important characteristics:
   unpacking national science standards, developing a learning
   performances approach to specifying teaming goals, and aligning
   learning goals, instructional activities, and assessments. Using a case
   study of an IQWST unit from initial development through two cycles of
   enactment, we describe how these three characteristics help guide
   curriculum design, identify design issues in curriculum enactments, and
   guide the development of design solutions. The iterative use of the
   learning-goals-driven design model coupled with the analysis of
   multiple data sources informed our revision of the curriculum
   materials, resulting in substantial student learning gains for the
   targeted science content and scientific inquiry learning goals. (c)

SO SCIENCE EDUCATION

AB We investigated general chemistry students' intuitive ideas about the
   expected properties of the products of a chemical reaction. In
   particular, we analyzed college chemistry students' predictions about
   the color, smell, and taste of the products of chemical reactions
   represented at the molecular level. The study was designed to explore
   the extent to which novice learners intuitively use an additive
   framework to predict the properties of the product, rather than an
   approach that recognizes the emergent nature of the properties of
   chemical compounds. To this end, we used a mixed-methods research
   approach based on answers to multiple-choice questions and individual
   interviews with students enrolled in the first year of an introductory
   general chemistry course for science and engineering majors. Our
   results indicate that most students at this level rely on an additive
   heuristic to predict the properties of chemical compounds, overlooking
   the possibility of emergent properties resulting from the interaction
   of the atoms that compose the system. Chemistry instructors and
   chemical educators thus need to intentionally design learning
   opportunities for students to recognize and differentiate additive and
   emergent properties in a variety of contexts. (c) 2007 Wiley

AB Although misconceptions in science have been established in interview
   studies, their role during the learning process is poorly examined. In
   this paper, we use results from a classroom study to analyze to what
   extent nonscientific ideas in electrochemistry that students report in
   interviews enter into their learning in a more authentic setting. We
   audio-recorded talk between eight pairs of Swedish upper secondary
   students during a practical on electrochemical cells. Learning was
   operationalized on a discursive level as a description of what students
   do and say when taking part in an activity. This enabled an analysis of
   how encounters with misconceptions influenced the development of
   students' reasoning, compared to other encounters during the learning
   experience. Misconceptions did not constrain the development of
   students' reasoning. Rather, their reasoning developed in response to
   the contingencies of the specific situation. When misconceptions were
   encountered, they appeared as alternatives and questions not actively
   defended. Sometimes, encounters with these misconceptions were
   generative of the students' reasoning. The results indicate that
   demonstrating misconceptions in interviews is not enough to assume that
   they interfere with learning in other contexts. Educational
   implications and future lines of research based on these findings and
   on the methodology applied are discussed. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals,

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID LITERACY; PUPILS
AB Reading and writing stories with science-related themes make it
   possible for students to develop interest in and capacity for
   scientific thinking when specialist science and more popular genres
   converge. Additionally, feminist scholars have called for greater use
   of creative writing activities in school science to counter students'
   disengagement in participating in science discourses. However, few
   studies have been conducted into how students construct meaning as
   fictional and non-fictional science genres are merged in writing
   activities. The purpose of this interpretive study was to investigate
   what happens when a class of fourth-grade children co-creates a
   publishable eco-mystery that integrates both fiction and non-fiction -
   with their teacher. Interpretations are organized around two themes;
   namely, when genres clash, and scaffolding science learning. The study
   asserts that the children's engagement and interest in the writing
   tasks were sustained across genres and that the children demonstrated
   fluency in their use of canonically accurate knowledge of
   ecological/biological concepts embedded in the eco-mystery with
   scaffolding from their teacher. Additional evidence suggests that the
   children's fluency with scientific registers had more than a short-term
   effect.

AB The rapid growth of biotechnology knowledge during the past decades has
   made it necessary to rethink the contents of the school curriculum and
   has provoked a consideration of the ethical and social issues related
   to the use of biotechnological applications. With the financial
   assistance of the European Union, the European Initiative for
   Biotechnology Education was set up to develop units for use in the
   member the countries, organize the translations of these between the
   many languages involved, organize in-service courses for teachers,
   implement the materials in schools, as well as carrying out related
   research.
   This paper gives some findings of Spanish researchers when identifying
   and exploring the different cultural contexts in which biotechnology
   teaching and learning is embedded, being mainly concerned with the
   emerging attitudes and values of the students regarding such issues.
   After gathering information through case studies during the
   implementation phase, a questionnaire was developed in an interactive
   way by teachers and researchers in various stages, based on what
   students said.
   The results identify four main values: the "principle of the natural",
   the "principle of the welfare", the " principle of the technological
   solution" and the "principle of the individual decisions". Their
   interaction and dichotomy are discussed, as well as the problems
   teachers face when having to deal with topics beyond those immediately
   related to science.

AB This study explored the effects of a cognitive intervention programme,
   Cognitive Acceleration in Science at Key Stage 1 (CASE@KS1), on both
   the thinking skills and motivation of a rural population in the United
   Kingdom. It used a quasi-experimental design and measures of both near
   and far transfer in order to replicate the evaluation of this programme
   by Adey and colleagues with an urban population. In general, support
   was found for the positive findings of Adey and colleagues, with some
   significant findings on a near-transfer task but more inconclusive
   findings on a far-transfer task. The motivational measure used in this
   study identified some issues of interest, including gender difference
   in response, suggesting the value of motivational assessment in
   evaluation of the CASE@KS1 intervention programme.

ID ICT
AB Australia wide, all school systems are in the process of providing
   teachers with computers and there is an expectation that new teachers
   will possess the expertise to use them in their teaching. In addition
   to using computers for basic word processing and data manipulation,
   early-career science teachers need to be able to use a range of
   Information Communication Technology (ICT)-related resources
   effectively in the science classroom. The purpose of this research
   study was to examine the extent to which early-career ( less than 3
   years of experience) science teachers perceived that their preservice
   education prepared them to use ICT in their teaching role, to clarify
   the nature of their ICT use, and to identify factors that enhance or
   inhibit their use of ICT. Through questionnaire and interview, it was
   found that the most frequent uses of ICT were word processing, Internet
   research, email, and PowerPoint while the least frequent uses were palm
   top computers, web page design, online discussion groups, and virtual
   excursions. The factors that most enhanced ICT use were access to the
   Internet and computers, teacher confidence, and skills and workload.
   The factors that most inhibited ICT use were workload, behaviour
   management issues, and access to computers and the Internet. The
   findings of this study will inform preservice science education and
   professional development workshops.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID STUDENTS DIFFICULTIES; ELEMENTARY ASTRONOMY; CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; READING
   IMAGES; SCIENCE; EXPLANATIONS; ARTIFACTS; ENERGY
AB Visual representations play an important role in science teaching. The
   way in which visual representations may help children to acquire
   scientific concepts is a crucial test in the debate between
   constructivist and socio-cultural oriented researchers. In this paper,
   the question is addressed as a problem of how to contextualize
   conceptions and explanations in cognitive frameworks and visual
   descriptions in cultural contexts. Eleven children aged 6-8 years were
   interviewed in the presence of a globe. Those children who expressed
   views of the Earth that deviated from the culturally accepted view did
   not show any difficulties in combining these different ideas with the
   globe model. The way that this is possible is explained using a model
   of conceptual development as a process of differentiation between
   contexts and frameworks. The child must differentiate not only between
   the Earth as an area of flat ground in a common-sense framework and the
   planet Earth in a theoretical framework, but also between these
   frameworks and the framework of the representation. It is suggested
   that a differentiation on a meta-level is needed to distinguish which
   problems and explanations belong to which cognitive framework. In
   addition, the children must contextualize the visual description of the
   Earth in the globe in a cultural context to discern which mode of
   representation is used.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine how prior knowledge of
   cellular transport influenced how high school students in the USA
   viewed and interpreted graphic representations of this topic. The
   participants were Advanced Placement Biology students (n = 65); each
   participant had previously taken a biology course in high school. After
   assessing prior knowledge using the Diffusion and Osmosis Diagnostic
   Test, two graphical representations of cellular transport processes
   were selected for analysis. Three different methods of data collection
   - eye tracking, interviews, and questionnaires - were used to
   investigate differences in perceived salient features of the graphics,
   interpretations of the graphics, and processing difficulty experienced
   while attending to and interpreting the graphics. The results from the
   eye tracking data, interviews, and instructional representation
   questionnaires were triangulated and revealed differences in how high
   and low prior knowledge students attended to and interpreted particle
   differences, concentration gradient, the role of adenosine
   triphosphate, endocytosis and exocytosis, and text labels and captions.
   Without adequate domain knowledge, low prior knowledge students focused
   on the surface features of the graphics ( ex. differences in particle
   colour) to build an understanding of the concepts represented. On the
   other hand, with more abundant and better-organised domain knowledge,
   high prior knowledge students were more likely to attend to the
   thematically relevant content in the graphics, which enhanced their
   understanding. The findings of this study offer a more complete
   understanding of how differentially prepared learners view and
   interpret graphics and have the potential to inform instructional
   design.

AB Previous studies have indicated that A-level students in the UK and
   Singapore have difficulty learning the topic of ionisation energy. A
   two-tier multiple-choice instrument developed in Singapore in an
   earlier study, the Ionisation Energy Diagnostic Instrument, was
   administered to A-level students in the UK, advanced placement high
   school students in the USA, and first-year university students in
   China, New Zealand, and Spain to determine whether the students from
   different countries and educational systems had similar conceptions and
   difficulties as the students in Singapore with the concepts assessed in
   the instrument. The results showed that, in general, the students in
   all six samples had similar alternative conceptions, which were grouped
   under the categories of octet rule framework, stable fully-filled and
   half-filled subshell conceptions, and conservation of force thinking.
   The students also resorted to relation-based thinking when answering
   items involving the trend of ionisation energies across Period 3.
   Implications for teaching and further research are discussed.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE; THINKING
AB In order to enhance teachers' professional awareness, it is necessary
   to understand and value their subjective or personal knowledge and
   beliefs. This study investigated the change of science teachers'
   personal knowledge about teaching models and modelling in science
   within the context of educational reform in The Netherlands. The study
   followed nine experienced science teachers during the first years of
   the implementation of a new syllabus, which emphasises models and
   modelling. Data collection consisted of the repeated administration of
   a Repertory Grid instrument. From the results, three different types of
   personal knowledge concerning teaching models and modelling in science
   were identified, each of which showed significant change over time.
   Type 1 combined modelling as an activity undertaken by students with
   the learning of specific model content. In Type 2, the learning of
   model content was combined with critical reflection on the role and
   nature of models in science. Finally, in Type 3, the learning of model
   content involved both students' production and revision of models, and
   a critical examination of the nature of scientific models in general.
   Implications for the teachers' professional development are discussed.

TI Analysis of five high school biology textbooks used in the united
   states for inclusion of the nature of science
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENTIFIC LITERACY THEMES; TEACHERS CONCEPTIONS; LIFE-SCIENCE;
   STUDENTS; INQUIRY; IDEAS
AB Five high school biology textbooks were examined to determine the
   inclusion of four aspects of the nature of science: (a) science as a
   body of knowledge, (b) science as a way of investigating, (c) science
   as a way of thinking, and (d) science and its interactions with
   technology and society. The textbooks analyzed were BSCS Biology-A
   Human Approach (Kendall/ Hunt), BSCS Biology-An Ecological Approach
   (Kendall/ Hunt), Biology-The Dynamics of Life (Glencoe), Modern Biology
   (Holt), and Prentice Hall Biology (Prentice Hall). The same six
   chapters or sections were analyzed in each textbook, which were the
   methods of science, cells, heredity, DNA, evolution, and ecology. A
   scoring procedure was used that resulted, for the most part, in good
   intercoder agreement with Cohen's kappa values ranging from 0.36-1.00.
   The five recently published biology textbooks in the United States have
   a better balance of presenting biology with respect to the four themes
   of science literacy used in this research than those analyzed 15 years
   ago, especially with regard to devoting more text to engaging students
   in finding out answers, gathering information, and learning how
   scientists go about their work. Therefore, these biology textbooks are
   incorporating national science education reform guides that recommend a
   more authentic view of the scientific enterprise than similar textbooks
   used 15 years ago.

AB The study was a pre-test treatment post-test control design. Three
   educational districts from the Niger Delta region of Nigeria were
   treated as clusters. Twenty boys and 20 girls were randomly selected,
   making up a total of 40 students, in each of Group A, Group B, and
   Group C. Students in Group A were taught ecology by taking them to the
   school farm, pond, and nearby stream, while students in Group B were
   taught ecology strictly in the classroom. Students in Group C were not
   taught but have knowledge of ecology. Findings of the study revealed a
   highest performance of Group A relative to Group B and Group C.
   Students in Group A (field trip) were thus able to perform highest
   because of their opportunity of having first-hand experience of
   organisms in their natural habitat.

   science and mathematics: An analysis of systemic reform data
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

DT Article
ID ACHIEVEMENT; VALIDATION; AUSTRALIA; TAIWAN
AB Using secondary analysis of a large database from a Statewide Systemic
   Initiative, we examined the effects of several types of environments on
   student outcomes. Over 3 years, nearly 7,000 students in 392 classes in
   200 different schools responded to a questionnaire that assesses class,
   home, and peer environments as well as student attitudes. Students also
   completed an achievement measure that, developed by scientists,
   teachers, and science educators, was not aligned with any particular
   curriculum. Students were enrolled in middle-school science and
   mathematics classes in schools that had participated in the Statewide
   Systemic Initiative. Rasch analyses allowed us to compare across
   student cohorts and across schools. Findings confirmed the importance
   of extending research on classroom learning environments to include the
   learning environments of the home and the peer group. Although all
   three environments accounted for statistically significant amounts of
   unique variance in student attitudes, only the class environment
   (defined in terms of the frequency of use of standards-based teaching
   practices) accounted for statistically significant amounts of unique
   variance in student achievement scores. The findings are supported by
   other studies of systemic reform in the United States.

ID SCIENCE; EDUCATION; COMICS
AB The Chemedian and the Crazy Football Match" is a comic strip developed
   by the authors to bring humour to aspects of the UK primary science
   curriculum. The comic strip was tested in six English primary school
   classes (years 3-5; ages 7-10); over 150 children participated in the
   project, together with six teachers. Children found the comic strip fun
   to read and engaged with the character. In addition, children were able
   to provide explanations for the ` science' performed by the Chemedian
   based on their own experience. However, it was notable that children
   found it hard to project actions the Chemedian would take in other
   similar situations that were based on the same scientific premises used
   in the comic strip. Instead, children seemed to draw on either their
   own preferences for actions or on actions they expected other more
   generalised comic characters might undertake. From the teacher
   assessments of class behaviour, it was clear that the comic strip
   format had engaged children, particularly boys, in what was essentially
   a reading and discussion based activity. This approach might open up
   new avenues for cross curricular links between science and literacy.

ID ACHIEVEMENT; MATHEMATICS; RESOURCES
AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences among
   schools using student responses in the Trends in Mathematics and
   Science Study-1999 (TIMSS-99) data. Schools were classified into two
   groups based on eighth grade students' overall achievement in science.
   Two different discriminant function analyses were performed to
   distinguish high- and low-performing schools, based both on classroom
   practices and factor structures (student-centered activities,
   teacher-centered activities, attitudes toward technology use,
   socioeconomic status [SES], and doing well in science). The results
   indicate that there were significant differences between the two
   classifications of schools on ten variables regarding classroom
   practices and activities, and 29 variables regarding classroom
   practices, attitudes toward science, use of the computer and overhead
   projector (OHP), parental background characteristics, and need to do
   well in science. Contrary to general expectations, technology use
   (computer, OHP, etc.) was found to be negatively related to science
   achievement. Teachers should be trained on how to use technology in
   their classrooms. Turkey recently revised its curriculum to a
   student-centered approach and this might increase students' ability to
   transfer knowledge into real life. Teachers and schools should pay more
   attention to SES effects. Teachers should also work toward building
   students' confidence in science. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID META-ANALYSIS
AB This project consisted of a meta-analysis of U.S. research published
   from 1980 to 2004 on the effect of specific science teaching strategies
   on student achievement. The six phases of the project included study
   acquisition, study coding, determination of intercoder objectivity,
   establishing criteria for inclusion of studies, computation of effect
   sizes for statistical analysis, and conducting the analyses. Studies
   were required to have been carried out in the United States, been
   experimental or quasi-experimental, and must have included effect size
   or the statistics necessary to calculate effect size. Sixty-one studies
   met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The following
   eight categories of teaching strategies were revealed during analysis
   of the studies (effect sizes in parentheses): Questioning Strategies
   (0.74); Manipulation Strategies (0.57); Enhanced Material Strategies
   (0.29); Assessment Strategies (0.51); Inquiry Strategies (0.65);
   Enhanced Context Strategies (1.48); Instructional Technology (IT)
   Strategies (0.48); and Collaborative Learning Strategies (0.95). All
   these effect sizes were judged to be significant. Regression analysis
   revealed that internal validity was influenced by Publication Type,
   Type of Study, and Test Type. External validity was not influenced by
   Publication Year, Grade Level, Test Content, or Treatment Categories.
   The major implication of this research is that we have generated
   empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of alternative teaching
   strategies in science. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID EARLY ADOLESCENTS; ATTITUDES; VALIDATION; EDUCATION
AB The Women in Science Scale (WiSS) was first developed in 1984, and is
   still being used in contemporary studies, yet its psychometric
   properties have not been evaluated with current statistical methods. In
   this study, the WiSS was administered in its original 27-item form to
   1,439 middle and high school students. Confirmatory factor analysis
   based upon the original description of the WiSS was modestly supportive
   of the proposed three-factor structure, but the claimed dimensions
   showed substantial redundancy. Therefore, we split our sample and
   performed exploratory factor analyses on one half. The most
   satisfactory solution, a two-factor model, was then applied to the
   crossvalidation sample with a confirmatory factor analysis. This
   two-factor structure was supported with a total of 14 items. Factor 1,
   Equality, contains eight items, and factor 2, Sexism, six items.
   Although our data are limited to adolescents, the WiSS, with improved
   psychometric properties, may be used descriptively to assess attitudes
   toward women in science and with additional stability and repeatability
   testing, may be used in evaluation research. The shortened WiSS should
   result in shorter administration time, fewer missing data, and
   increased acceptance among survey administrators in classroom settings.

TI An evolutionary approach to harnessing complex systems thinking in the

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID COGNITION; STUDENTS; KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION
AB Educational efforts to incorporate ethical decision-making in science
   classrooms about current science and technology issues have met with
   great challenges. Some research suggests that the inherent complexity
   in both the subject matter content and the structure and dynamics of
   classrooms contribute to this challenge. This study seeks to
   investigate the viability of an educational heuristic based on a
   complex systems evolutionary approach to both harness complexity
   inherent in the learning system of the classroom and to improve student
   knowledge of a complex scientific issue. The evolutionary mechanisms of
   variation, interaction, and selection were used to construct a 10-day
   curriculum and instruction unit on the topic of genetic engineering.
   Eleven Grade 9 students participated in the study. The data analysis
   was completed using three data sources: daily database discussions and
   ratings and rationales provided over four time-points, probing student
   opinions and understanding of genetic engineering research. A
   repeated-measures analysis of variance conducted on 43 student
   rationales indicated a continuing trend of increasing understanding of
   complex systems concepts over time. There is also evidence to show that
   students as a whole group operated as a complex system in their
   patterns of decision-making. A number of themes identified in student
   database discussions reveal processes students themselves believed
   influenced change at the social and conceptual level, including the
   evolutionary mechanisms upon which the program was designed.

TI Careful! It is H2O? Teachers' conceptions of chemicals
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CHEMISTRY; KNOWLEDGE; STUDENTS; SCIENCE; CONTEXT; EXPERT; NOVICE
AB A concept commonly used by both teachers and students is the term
   "chemical." Many students and teachers think of chemicals as
   artificial, poisonous, and dangerous. The purpose of the study was to
   investigate science teachers' ideas about" chemicals," along with their
   awareness of students' alternative conceptions and teaching practices
   that attempt to address alternative conceptions. Two main data sources
   were used: chemical surveys completed by 43 science teachers and
   interviews with nine chemistry teachers. Both surveys and the
   interviews were analyzed qualitatively to discern themes in teachers'
   conceptions of " chemicals" and its teachability. Survey analysis
   yielded four categories for teachers' conceptions: ( a) sound
   understanding; (b) coherent alternative conception; (c) inconsistent
   views; or (d) vague ideas. A most prominent finding from interviews was
   that, except for one teacher, all chemistry teachers either provided a
   correct definition of the term " chemical" from the beginning or
   eventually articulated it as the interview progressed, with three
   teachers changing their statements during the interview. All of the
   teachers except one were aware that their students have some kind of
   alternative conceptions. The teachers suggested a few possible sources
   of students' alterative conceptions, such as lack of relevancy of
   material in chemistry courses, insufficient expositions to chemistry
   courses, and faulty usage of the term in everyday language and the
   media. The teachers' suggestions for addressing alternative students'
   conceptions were varied. The nature of teachers' conceptions is
   discussed as dynamic. Implications such as the use of dialog and word
   reflection for problematic scientific terms by teachers are presented
   and discussed.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID SECONDARY STUDENTS; TEXT COMPREHENSION; SENSE; KNOWLEDGE; SCHOOL
AB This study discusses preservice elementary science teachers' (PSTs)
   epistemological beliefs and the relationships among their
   epistemological beliefs, epistemological world views, and self-efficacy
   beliefs. Four hundred and twenty-nine PSTs who were enrolled in five
   large universities completed the Schommer Epistemological Questionnaire
   (SEQ), the Epistemological World Views Scale, and the Science Teaching
   Efficacy Belief Instrument. Factor analysis results revealed four
   factors for the SEQ. These factors were Innate Ability, Simple
   Knowledge, Certain Knowledge, and Omniscient authority. Multiple
   regression analysis suggests that for "Innate Ability" factor scores,
   three of the predictor variables-self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, and
   world view-contributed significantly to the model. For "Simple
   Knowledge," only one predictor variable-epistemological world
   view-contributed significantly to the model. For " Certain Knowledge"
   factor scores, only one predictor variable-outcome
   expectancy-contributed significantly to the model. None of the
   predictor variables significantly contributed to the " Omniscient
   Authority" factor scores. Results revealed that in Turkish culture,
   PSTs' epistemological beliefs support the multidimensional theory. In
   addition, while PSTs developed more sophisticated beliefs in some of
   the SEQ dimensions, they had less sophisticated beliefs in other
   dimensions. Also PSTs indicated that, when they want to teach science
   with student-centered methods, they believed that they would be
   successful only if their students memorize the scientific concepts and
   facts.

ID GENDER-DIFFERENCES; COLLEGE CHEMISTRY; STRATEGY USE; STUDENTS; SCIENCE;
   INVENTORY
AB Our experience suggests that pre-service primary school teachers have
   problems with learning science, especially chemistry, and that this
   negative attitude towards science influences their future teaching. On
   that premise, the purpose of the study was to determine the level of
   the pre-service primary school teachers' intrinsic motivation for
   learning science in relation to some other subjects. The focus of the
   research was on the intrinsic motivation for learning chemistry and its
   correlation to students' academic achievements in chemistry. The study
   included 140 first-year pre-service primary school teachers who
   completed the questionnaire about their intrinsic motivation and a
   knowledge test about general chemistry concepts. Their results show
   that students are more or less equally motivated for chemistry as for
   any other subject, but that the intrinsic motivation plummets as the
   level of abstraction in individual subjects, such as chemistry and
   mathematics, increases. It has been similarly established that of the
   three levels of chemistry learning namely, macroscopic, submicroscopic,
   and symbolic-students were the least motivated to study concepts at the
   symbolic level. The correlation between the level of motivation and the
   knowledge test results is not strong; nevertheless, it is statistically
   significant, while the correlation between motivation and the mark
   achieved in chemistry is statistically not significant. The research
   results will assist us in our future search for more effective
   approaches to motivating students to study science. They can also be of
   assistance in encouraging students to devise educational strategies
   that will help them motivate their own students for science learning.

AB This study investigates the relationship between the students'
   understanding of the aims of an investigative activity and their
   performance when conducting it. One hundred and eighty-one year nine
   students from a public middle school in Brazil took part in the study.
   Students working in pairs were asked to investigate two problems using
   a computer-based environment. All their attempts to collect information
   were recorded in a log file, which registered the history of each duo
   investigation. After completing each investigation, all the
   participants were asked to explain in writing what the objective of the
   task was. Results obtained showed that a proportion of the students had
   some difficulties recalling the declared aims of the activities.
   However, those who succeeded in recognising the stated aims of the
   tasks showed a superior performance in conducting their investigations.
   This performance was graded according to both the proportion of
   adequate and consistent tests carried out and the quality of the
   investigation which was done.

AB Motivation and pressure are considered two factors impacting vocational
   senior high school student learning. New communication technology,
   especially mobile communication technology, is supposed to be effective
   in encouraging interaction between the student and the instructor and
   improving learning efficiency. Social presence and information richness
   theory was applied to analyze the media and their impacts on the
   instruction process firstly. Then the author observed firstly the
   impact of using individual communication technologies - namely Short
   Message Service (SMS), email, and online forum - on student learning
   motivation, pressure, and performance, based on a comparative
   investigation of 176 students. Then the impacts of using combination of
   mobile and Internet communication technology - SMS + email, SMS +
   online forum - were examined with another experiment of 45 students.
   The result showed that instant messaging helps bonding the two roles -
   student and instructor - in the instruction process effectively. When
   combined with Internet communication media, it can significantly
   increase student extrinsic motivation without causing higher pressure.
   Additionally, communication media demanding public expression rather
   than private dialogue should be adopted with careful consideration,
   since they may raise student pressure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB This study aims to provide teachers with ways and means to facilitate
   learners to develop nomenclature knowledge of family trees through the
   establishment of resource-based learning environments (RBLEs). It
   discusses the design of an RBLE in the classroom by selecting an
   appropriate context with the assistance of computer-mediated learning
   resources and tools and employing the inquiry learning approach as the
   pedagogy. This study reports on the creation of the RBLE within the
   learning context of family trees. The computer-mediated learning
   resources and tools comprise three components: an audio-visual database
   for guided and coupled inquiry, an interactive interface for
   conceptualising the nomenclature and a tool for learners to construct
   their own family trees. Scaffolds were designed for an inquiry mode of
   learning and teaching to support the use of the resources and tools in
   learning about family trees. The learning and teaching process,
   including the outcomes for learners, through the RBLE with inquiry
   learning approach are studied. The findings of an interview and a
   pre-test/post-test study indicate that the RBLE can assist learners to
   build knowledge of family trees. The role of teachers in such an
   environment is to guide and encourage learners to inquire during the
   learning process. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE decimal misconception; CAL; cognitive conflict; online review system
AB The study focused on the effects of the CAL system constructed via
   cognitive conflict of decimal numbers for the sixth graders. The
   purpose of the system is to gauge decimal concepts of students. When
   students entertain misconceptions or misleading ideas, the system will
   in accordance with the types of the wrong answer generate appropriate
   cognitive conflicts as feedback to help the students realize the
   irrational part of their ideas. Then through the instruction screen for
   cognitive adjustment students' original concepts are corrected.
   Research objects of this study were sixth-grade students from an
   elementary school in Taipei. The study took a quasi-experimental
   approach that employed pretest-posttest, non-equivalent-group design.
   The two groups of students were given the pretest, posttest, and
   postponed test in order to measure the effect of the system. They were
   also interviewed to see how their concepts had changed. This study
   found that, although most of the sixth graders did not understand the
   basic concepts of decimal numbers very well and their misconceptions
   were similar to those identified by other studies, the result of the
   experiments showed significant improvement following the use of the
   computer-aided learning system. The learning system helped students
   better retain the decimal concepts they acquired. Data from the
   interviews also indicated that the system, constructed on cognitive
   conflicts, can help students clear their misconceptions of decimals
   numbers. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID TEACHER; SCIENCE
AB The portability and immediate communication properties of mobile
   devices influence the learning processes in interacting with peers,
   accessing resources and transferring data. For example, the short
   message and browsing functions in a cell phone provide users with
   timely and adaptive information access. Although many studies of mobile
   learning indicate the pedagogical potential of mobile devices, the
   screen size, computational power, battery capacity, input interfaces,
   and network bandwidth are too restricted to develop acceptable
   functionality for the entire learning processes in a handheld device.
   Therefore, mobile devices can be adopted to fill the gap between
   Web-based learning and ubiquitous mobile learning. This study first
   creates a website, providing functions enabling learning to take place
   anytime and anywhere with any available learning device, for ubiquitous
   learning according to various properties of mobile devices. Nowadays,
   learners' behaviors on a website can be recorded as learning portfolios
   and analyzed for behavioral diagnosis or instructional planning. A
   student model is then built according to the analytical results of
   learning portfolios and a concept map of the learning domain. Based on
   the student model and learners' available learning devices, three
   modules are developed to build a ubiquitous learning environment to
   enhance learning performance via learning status awareness, schedule
   reminders and mentor recommendation. Finally, an experiment is
   conducted with 54 college students after implementation of the
   ubiquitous learning website. Experimental results indicate that the
   proposed system can enhance three learning performance indicators,
   namely academic performance, task accomplishment rates, and learning
   goals achievement rates. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Especially in vocational education, attention should be paid not only
   to the use of new technological solutions but also to collaborative
   learning and cooperative working methods in order to develop students'
   skills for their future jobs. This study involves a design experiment
   including the design process of a new game environment, description of
   the script developed for this game, as well as the empirical study with
   multiple data collection methods, data analysis, results and
   conclusions for further work. The aim of the study was twofold.
   Firstly, we aimed to develop a game environment to simulate the work
   context of a vocational design process, and secondly, to investigate
   how effective the game environment is in vocational learning and how
   scripting affected students' group processes during the game. It seems
   that, at their best, such "edugames" may enrich learning and the
   pedagogical use of technology. Although integrating learning and games
   provides tempting possibilities, it also contains many challenges, such
   as different group-specific learning processes despite the scripted
   environment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of an educational electronic book (e-book) on 149 five-to
   six-year-old kindergarteners' emergent literacy levels were researched
   in two SES groups: low (LSES) (79 children) vs. middle (MSES) (70
   children). In each SES group, children were randomly assigned to four
   groups. Three groups were assigned to work individually in one of three
   e-book activity modes: "Read story only", "Read with dictionary", or
   "Read and play" during three similar activity sessions and the fourth
   group served as a control which received the regular program of the
   kindergarten. Pre- and post-intervention emergent literacy measures
   included word meaning, word recognition, and phonological awareness.
   Results show that word meaning of children from both middle and low SES
   improved following the educational e-book activity, regardless of mode.
   Second, LSES children's emergent literacy levels showed relatively
   greater improvement rates than did those of the MSES children. Third,
   children in the "Read with dictionary" and "Read and play" activity
   modes showed more improvement in their emergent literacy levels than
   did those in the "Read story only" mode. Implications for future
   research and for education are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB This paper explores the application of distributed cognition theory to
   educational contexts by examining a common learning interaction, the
   `Copy and Paste' function. After a discussion of distributed cognition
   and the role of mediating artefacts in real world cognitions, the `Copy
   and Paste' function is redesigned to embed an effective interaction
   strategy, based on encoding strategies, into the interface. The current
   affordances of the `Copy and Paste' interaction derived from its
   business heritage (speed and accuracy of reproduction) are contrasted
   with those needed for a learning interaction (the meaningful processing
   of content for understanding). An empirical study was conducted to test
   the efficacy of the redesigned function through an experimental
   treatment. The study examined the impact of an experimental treatment
   based on changes to the `Copy and Paste' function in terms of:
   (a) changes to interaction strategies employed by learners;
   (b) changes in learner familiarity with note taking and summarisation
   interaction strategies;
   (c) changes to the features of the text produced by learners.
   The experimental task consisted of participants completing three short
   written assessment tasks based on multiple text resources using either:
   (i) Control treatment: standard notepad tools supplemented by a
   text-based resource outlining notetaking and summarisation strategies;
   or (ii) Experimental treatment: the modified notepad. The results of
   the study showed that participants in the experimental group spent
   significantly more time engaged in activities that indicated higher
   levels of cognitive processing and produced notes that contained text
   features that also indicated significantly higher levels of cognitive
   processing. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Studies have demonstrated that students prefer PowerPoint and respond
   favorably to classes when it is used. Few studies have addressed the
   physical structure of PowerPoint. In this study, students enrolled in
   several psychology classes on two campuses completed a 36 item
   questionnaire regarding their preferences for the use of PowerPoint in
   the classroom. Students preferred the use of key phrase outlines,
   pictures and graphs, slides to be built line by line, sounds from
   popular media or that support the pictures or graphics on the slide,
   color backgrounds, and to have the lights dimmed. It is recommended
   that professors pay attention to the physical aspects of PowerPoint
   slides and handouts to further enhance students' educational
   experience. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Educational software games aim at increasing the students' motivation
   and engagement while they learn. However, if software games are
   targeted to school classrooms they have to be usable and likeable by
   all students. Usability of virtual reality games may be a problem
   because these games tend to have complex user interfaces so that they
   are more attractive. Moreover, if the games acquire an educational
   content they may lose the attractiveness and appeal that they have on
   users who are familiar with commercial games. Consequently, likeability
   may also be questioned. In this paper, we address the issue of
   usability and likeability of a virtual reality game that is meant to
   teach students geography. We describe the evaluation experiments
   conducted, which involved three categories of students in terms of
   their level of game-playing expertise: novice, intermediate and expert
   game players. The evaluation results showed that the game was indeed
   usable and likeable but there was scope for usability and likeability
   improvement so that the educational benefits may be maximised for all
   categories of students. The evaluation studies reported in this paper,
   revealed important issues about further research on virtual reality
   educational games. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Program animation systems have not been as widely adopted by computer
   science educators as we might expect from the firm belief that they can
   help in enhancing computer science education. One of the most notable
   obstacles to their adoption is the considerable effort that the
   production of program animations represents for the instructor. We
   present here an approach to reduce such a workload based on the
   automatic generation of visualizations and animations. The user may
   customize them in a user-friendly way to construct more expressive
   program animations. These operations are carried out by means of a
   user-friendly manipulation based on the metaphor of office documents.
   We have applied this approach to the functional paradigm by extending
   the WinHIPE programming environment. Finally, we report on the
   successful results of an evaluation performed to measure its ease of
   use. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We take a socio-cultural approach to comparing how dual control of a
   new user interface paradigm - Separate Control of Shared Space (SCOSS)
   - and dual control of a single user interface can work to mediate the
   collaborative decision-making process between pairs of children
   carrying out a multiple categorisation word task on a shared computer.
   Qualitative analysis focuses on how the interface properties of SCOSS
   can encourage each child to participate in the task and to represent
   their own opinions as part of the process of reaching final joint
   agreement. We conclude by suggesting additional features to improve the
   content of collaborative conversations and by proposing other contexts
   that may benefit from this interface. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

TI Blending asynchronous discussion groups and peer tutoring in higher

SO COMPUTERS & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE computer-supported collaborative learning; CSCL; higher education; peer
   tutoring
AB In the present study cross-age peer tutoring was implemented in a
   higher education context. Fourth-year students (N = 39) operated as
   online tutors to support freshmen in discussing cases and solving
   authentic problems. This study contributes to a better understanding of
   the supportive interventions of tutors in asynchronous discussion
   groups. Peer tutor interventions were studied by means of a content
   analysis scheme based on the e-moderating model of Salmon [Salmon, G.
   (2000). A model for CMC in education and training. E-moderating. The
   key to teaching and learning online. London: Kogan Page]. The
   descriptive results reveal that the type of tutor activities varies
   over the consecutive discussion themes. No evidence was however found
   for a significant evolution from introductory and social talk to
   contributions eliciting cognitive processing and critical thinking
   along the themes. Tutors' social support seems to be of continuous
   importance. Further, cluster analysis resulted in a classification of
   the tutors into three different subtypes or tutor styles ('motivators',
   'informers' and 'knowledge constructors'), which was interpreted as
   confirmation of Tutor-dependent online peer tutoring behaviour. (c)

AB The purpose of this study was to identify factors influencing teachers'
   decisions about using technology in the classroom setting and examine
   the degree to which teaching experience affects these decisions.
   Specifically, the items employed in this study were derived from the
   teachers' perceptions of technology use. We discovered six factors
   which influenced teachers use technology in their classroom: adapting
   to external requests and others' expectations, deriving attention,
   using the basic functions of technology, relieving physical fatigue,
   class preparation and management, and using the enhanced functions of
   technology. Interestingly, these factors do not correspond to the
   common sense theory of instructional technology. Additionally, we
   analyzed the patterns of factors' scores by teachers' level of teaching
   experience. From this study we deduced that although the majority of
   teachers intend to use technology to support teaching and leaning,
   experienced teachers generally decide to use technology involuntarily
   in response to external forces while teachers with little experience
   are more likely to use it on their own will. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Students can practice skills and construct knowledge by carrying out
   coursework. However, every student is assigned the same problem in
   general hands-on coursework activities, with no consideration for
   learners' diversity. Hence, some students do not take the task
   seriously when producing their coursework. Furthermore, what one has
   learned - that is, the knowledge constructed by learners - cannot be
   shared efficiently during traditional coursework activity. This paper
   proposes the construction of a journal-publishing community, connecting
   through a publication called Coursework Journal, in a web-based
   coursework environment designed to improve the efficiency of knowledge
   sharing for a programming course by endowing learners with roles. This
   paper extends the organizational development concept of a community of
   practice to the web-based coursework environment, following the
   definition of a community of practice for situated learning described
   by Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger, who suggested sociocultural theories
   of learning as alternatives for cognitive theories of learning. Results
   of data analysis and questionnaires indicate that the Coursework
   Journal can promote knowledge sharing effectively, improve the quality
   of students' coursework, and advance learning performance accordingly.

AB Bearing in mind the importance of a transition from teacher-centred,
   lecture-based teaching to student-centred, technology-based learning,
   this study examined teachers' interest to achieve educational
   technology standards (INTEREST) in terms of their computer attitude
   (ATTITUDE), computer experience (EXPERIENCE) and the professional
   support to achieve these standards offered to them from their
   institutions (SUPPORT). The study used a sample of 129 elementary
   student teachers from Finland and Serbia. The two groups of teachers
   differed in all examined variables: EXPERIENCE was higher for the
   Finnish students, whereas ATTITUDE, INTEREST and SUPPORT were higher
   for the Serbian students. Furthermore, contrary to the Finnish
   students, the Serbian student indicated that they received some
   instruction on ET standards during their studies and designed learning
   activities to promote the examined standards. By applying a two-group
   path analysis, it was found that to improve INTEREST, we need to
   improve ATTITUDE by means of EXPERIENCE. The analyzed data evidence
   that a desired role of SUPPORT (positive impact on EXPERIENCE and
   ATTITUDE) can be achieved when SUPPORT respects EXPERIENCE.
   Implications for practice and directions for further research are
   examined. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Le@rning Federation, an agency funded by Australian and New Zealand
   governments, initiated a Field Review project as the start of a
   long-term research study to evaluate the impact, application and
   effectiveness of the online digital content developed according to the
   learning object model. In terms of content, the pilot Field Review
   found that many learning objects provided stimulating and diverse
   learning experiences for students. It is one of the potential strengths
   of learning objects that they are able to provide new geographical
   experiences and simulate dangerous or expensive learning activities at
   low relative cost. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Technology-based instruction represents a new recent pedagogical
   paradigm that is rooted in the realization that new generations are
   much more comfortable with, and excited about, new technologies. The
   rapid technological advancement over the past decade has fueled an
   enormous demand for the integration of modern networking, informational
   and computational tools with classical pedagogical instruments.
   Consequently, teaching with technology typically involves utilizing a
   variety of IT and multimedia resources for online learning, course
   management, electronic course materials, and novel tools of
   communication, engagement, experimental, critical thinking, and
   assessment.
   The NSF-funded Statistics Online Computational Resource (SOCR) provides
   a number of interactive tools for enhancing instruction in various
   undergraduate and graduate courses in probability and statistics. These
   resources include online instructional materials, statistical
   calculators, interactive graphical user interfaces, computational and
   simulation applets, tools for data analysis and visualization. The
   tools provided as part of SOCR include conceptual simulations and
   statistical computing interfaces, which are designed to bridge between
   the introductory and the more advanced computational and applied
   probability and statistics courses. In this manuscript, we describe our
   designs for utilizing SOCR technology in instruction in a recent study.
   In addition, present the results of the effectiveness of using SOCR
   tools at two different course intensity levels on three outcome
   measures: exam scores, student satisfaction and choice of technology to
   complete assignments. Learning styles assessment was completed at
   baseline. We have used three very different designs for three different
   undergraduate classes. Each course included a treatment group, using
   the SOCR resources, and a control group, using classical instruction
   techniques. Our findings include marginal effects of the SOCR treatment
   per individual classes; however, pooling the results across all courses
   and sections, SOCR effects on the treatment groups were exceptionally
   robust and significant. Coupling these findings with a clear decrease
   in the variance of the quantitative examination measures in the
   treatment groups indicates that employing technology, like SOCR, in a
   sound pedagogical and scientific manner enhances overall the students'
   understanding and suggests better long-term knowledge retention. (c)

AB Within the context of an introductory CS I unit on algorithmic
   problem-solving, we are exploring the pedagogical value of a novel
   active learning activity-the "studio experience"-that actively engages
   learners with algorithm visualization technology. In a studio
   experience, student pairs are tasked with (a) developing a solution to
   an algorithm design problem, (b) constructing an accompanying
   visualization with a storyline, and finally (c) presenting that
   visualization for feedback and discussion in a session modeled after an
   architectural "design crit." Is a studio experience educationally
   valuable? What kind of technology can best support it? To explore these
   questions, we conducted an empirical study of two alternative CSI
   studio experiences in which students used one of two different kinds of
   algorithm development and visualization technology: (a) a text editor
   coupled with art supplies, or (b) ALVIS Live!, a computer-based
   algorithm development and visualization tool. We found that the
   students who used ALVIS Live! developed algorithms with significantly
   fewer semantic errors. Moreover, discussions mediated by ALVIS Live!
   had significantly more student audience contributions, and retained a
   sharper focus on the specific details of algorithm behavior, leading to
   the collaborative identification and repair of semantic errors. In
   addition, discussions mediated by both ALVIS Live! and art supplies
   contained substantial evidence of higher order thinking. Based on our
   results, we make recommendations for educators interested in exploring
   studio-based approaches, and we propose an agenda for future research
   into studio-based learning in computer science education. (c) 2006

AB People expect Web technology to facilitate learning, particularly in
   higher education. A key issue involves the factors motivating the
   adoption of the Web for learning. Drawing upon social cognitive theory
   (SCT) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study adopts a
   cognition-motivation-control view to assess learner adoption intentions
   for Web-based learning. The proposed model is validated by surveying
   319 undergraduate students who had enrolled in Web-based courses and
   attended a 12-hour training program on using a Web-based system for
   academic learning. The empirical findings identified that efficacy
   control and efficacy expectations can be used to guide learner
   adaptation learning behaviors on the Web. The limitations of this study
   are discussed and future research directions suggested. (c) 2006

AB This study discusses the pedagogical potential of an interactive voting
   system used in conjunction with interactive whiteboard technology. The
   data discussed here are drawn from a qualitative study, carried out in
   the context of a British university pre-sessional programme in English
   for Academic Purposes and Study Skills for international students in
   the summers of 2003 and 2004. Research data were collected via a
   variety of ethnographic research instruments, namely classroom
   observations and feedback from critical colleagues, teacher's field
   notes, video recording of classes, semi-structured interviews with
   students, and pre- and post-course student questionnaires. The findings
   indicate that the electronic voting system was seen to increase
   considerably the scope of interactivity during the lessons by helping
   students to enhance their development into active participants.
   However, the data have also indicated that the levels of interactivity
   in the approaches adopted in the context investigated could still be
   considered relatively "shallow", and some suggestions have been
   provided to improve this aspect of technology use. (c) 2006 Elsevier

   categorization performance using the incoming question items. PKIP tool
   has an advantage over the traditional document categorization methods
   in that it can correctly categorize the question item which lacks
   keywords since it adopts the feature selection technique and support
   vector machine approach to item bank text categorization. In our
   initial experimentation, PKIP was designed and implemented to manage
   the Thai high primary mathematics question items. PKIP was tested and
   evaluated in terms of both system accuracy and user satisfaction. The
   evaluation result shows that the system accuracy is acceptable and PKIP
   satisfies the need of the users. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The interaction spaces between instructors and learners in the
   traditional face-to-face classroom environment are being changed by the
   diffusion and adoption of many forms of computer-based pedagogy. An
   integrated understanding of these evolving interaction spaces together
   with how they interconnect and leverage learning are needed to develop
   meaningful strategies for effective teaching and learning. The 18i
   collaborative interaction spaces model was designed based on
   constructivist principles, and describes 18 mixed instructor-learner
   spaces contextualized at a finer operational scale that makes explicit
   a wider range of interactions. The model was implemented during the
   life cycle of an undergraduate GIS-based multimedia cartography course.
   One output was the generation of a repository of rule-based trajectory
   plans for rapid planning and problem solving. The model provides an
   integrated workflow to manage course contents, products, interactions,
   individuality, and learning styles in blended environments. (c) 2006

AB The purpose of this case study is to better understand the
   relationships between Web usability and students' perceived learning in
   the design and implementation of Web-based multimedia (WBMM) tutorials
   in blended courses. Much of the current research in this area focuses
   on the use of multimedia as a replacement for classroom instruction
   rather than as a complement to teaching practices in courses that meet
   face-to-face. This study analyzed data collected from 41 undergraduate
   students who accessed a series of WBMM tutorials to learn Web design in
   an upper-level undergraduate information science course that combines
   both in-class and online instruction. We provide a descriptive analysis
   of student survey responses and apply Kendall's rank correlation
   coefficient to examine significant relationships (p < 0.05) between
   usability factors and students' perceived learning performance. We also
   explore the impact of WBMM on other aspects of the course, such as
   readings, email, office hours, and computer lab. Findings indicate that
   students responded favorably to most of the usability factors defined
   in this study and that course lectures and readings may have been
   enhanced by this virtual resource. In addition, we identified a
   significant correlation between usability factors of the WBMM tutorials
   and how students perceive their own learning. This study suggests that
   multimedia instruction is an effective approach to teaching Web design
   in blended learning environments that include both face-to-face and
   Web-based resources. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Assessment of the NEOTHEMI virtual museum project - An on-line survey
SO COMPUTERS & EDUCATION
LA English

   evaluation of CAL systems
AB The NEOTHEMI Comenius 3 network focused on cultural heritage and aimed
   to produce a virtual museum of cultural heritage from ten countries in
   Europe, including Hungary, which joined the EU in 2004, and Norway, an
   associated country, to encourage users to develop an understanding of
   the cultural heritage of other European countries and to feel more
   European. This paper assesses the effectiveness of the project in
   reaching its target audience.
   Most of the questionnaire respondents were students in large
   (secondary) schools, primarily in suburban areas. Adult users were
   mostly teachers, including senior staff; half were in smaller (under
   500) and nearly a third in rural schools, suggesting NEOTHEMI was
   reaching its target of making cultural heritage available to those who
   could not readily access it in the real world for geographical reasons
   and helping them to understand others.
   NEOTHEMI had been most used in language work and had helped students
   understand both their own and other cultures better, and to understand
   different points of view and difficult issues.
   Factor analysis showed teachers' views were more differentiated than
   those of students; teachers simultaneously emphasized problems and
   benefits, in a differentiated and subject-related way. Rural students
   were significantly more positive about the educational use of the
   Internet, though their cultural attitudes were more parochial than
   those of urban students. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB By focusing on two dimensions of the digital divide-computer use and
   computer knowledge, this study explores four research questions: (1)
   What are the undergraduates doing with the computers they use at
   colleges? (2) How do undergraduates perform in regard to computer
   knowledge and skills? (3) With what is the digital divide among college
   students correlated? (4) What consequences does the digital divide have
   for student academic performance? In order to answer these research
   questions, a national survey was conducted. The survey investigated
   3083 first-year college students of 12 4-year universities in Taiwan. A
   total of 2719 of them completed the questionnaires resulting in a
   response rate of 88.2%. In this study, the digital divide is measured
   in terms of computer use, which includes a variety of purposes for
   using computers and academic-related work as a proportion of total
   computer hours, and computer knowledge. Multiple regressions and a
   generalized ordered logit, i.e. a partial proportional odds model, are
   employed. The main findings include the following: (1) Undergraduates
   use computers not only for fulfilling their academic requirements and
   searching for information, but also for entertainment. On average,
   undergraduates spend about 19 h per week using computers, of which 5 h
   are academic-related. (2) Most undergraduates perform at the middle
   average level in terms of computer knowledge. (3) No significant
   differences among correlates in relating to demographic and
   socioeconomic family background were found in predicting the various
   purposes in using computers. (4) Students who are female, whose fathers
   and/or whose mothers are from minorities, whose fathers are blue-collar
   workers or unemployed, who study in the fields of the humanities and
   social sciences, and who enter private universities are at a
   disadvantage in terms of computer skills and knowledge. However, female
   students, students whose mothers were less educated and students who
   enroll in private universities are more focused computer users in terms
   of allocating time to academic-related work. (5) Computer knowledge and
   devotion to using computers for academic-related work have a moderate
   effect on college student learning, while the various other uses of
   computers do not. Of the different kinds of computer knowledge, it is
   the knowledge of software that helps students to learn the most. (c)

   towards democracy
AB The aims of this study are to find out (1) how student teachers'
   attitudes toward Internet affect their attitudes toward democracy, (2)
   how student teachers' attitudes toward democracy are in terms of their
   purpose of using Internet and (3) benefits provided by the Internet.
   The research is carried out in Ziya Gokalp Education Faculty at Dicle
   University during 2005-2006 academic year by the participation of 440
   student teachers in total. "Likert Type Attitude Scale Toward the Use
   of Internet", was used to determine the student teachers' attitudes
   toward the Internet and "The Attitude Scale Toward Democracy" was used
   to find out the attitudes of the student teachers toward democracy. The
   data are analyzed by using variance analysis and correlation (Pearson)
   techniques. Scheffe test is used for significance test. A positive
   significant correlation was determined between subscales ("using
   Internet in teaching", "using Internet in research", "liking to use
   Internet in teaching", "using Internet in communication" and "using
   Internet in sharing information") of attitude scale towards using
   Internet and subscales ("inclination to democracy", "devotion to
   democracy" and "qualities of democracy") of attitude scale towards
   democracy. However, a negative significant correlation is found between
   the attitudes of student teachers toward "using Internet in teaching",
   "using Internet in research", "liking to use Internet in teaching" and
   "negative view to democracy". According to student teachers' purpose of
   using Internet, the difference between their attitudes towards
   "devotion to democracy" and "qualities of democracy" is significant. In
   addition, the difference between their attitudes toward "devotion to
   democracy" is significant in terms of the benefits provided by
   Internet. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The effect of increasing conceptual challenge in primary science
   lessons on pupils' achievement and engagement
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID ATTITUDE
AB This paper reports research into the effect on 11-year-old pupils of
   introducing more cognitively challenging, practical, and interactive
   science lessons. Our hypothesis was that such lessons would increase
   the children's enthusiasm for science and their engagement with the
   scientific process, thereby improving educational performance. Schools
   in England are under pressure to raise achievement, as measured by the
   results of national tests. This has an impact on teaching, where
   revision of subject knowledge often dominates and can be particularly
   detrimental to more able pupils. The research was a controlled trial
   which took place in thirty-two English primary schools as part of a
   project "Conceptual Challenge in Primary Science". Teachers from 16
   intervention schools participated in continuing professional
   development (CPD) and developed science lessons that had more practical
   work, more discussion, more thinking and less (but more focused)
   writing. The proportion of pupils achieving the highest level (level 5)
   in the national science tests at age 11 was compared in the
   matched-school pairs before and after the intervention. Focus group
   interviews were also held with a group of pupils in each intervention
   school. There was a 10% (95% Confidence Interval 2-17%) increase in the
   proportion of children achieving the top score in the intervention
   schools. The pupils and teachers reported greater engagement and
   motivation. These findings suggest that moving from rote revision to
   cognitively challenging, interactive science could help improve science
   education. They merit replication in other international settings to
   test their generalisability.

TI Classroom discourse as a tool to enhance formative assessment and
   practise in science
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This study details an innovative approach to coordinating and enhancing
   multiple levels of assessment and discursive feedback around an
   existing multi-media curricular environment called Astronomy
   Village(R). As part of a broader design-based research programme, the
   study analysed small group interactions in feedback activities across
   two design cycles. The goal of this analysis is to develop an
   understanding of the ways that a situative approach to assessment and
   practise supports learning. Findings demonstrate ways that student and
   teacher engagement in collaborative activities support and constrain
   meaningful understanding, which we consider in terms of a trajectory of
   participation in and across conversations and written assessments, as
   well as individual learning gains on formal classroom examinations and
   standards-oriented external tests. Analyses of complementary
   formulations of domain concepts-discourse practises and assessment
   performance-suggest that participation in social forms of scientific
   engagement supports both learning and subsequent performance in more
   formal contexts. We suggest design principles for integrating the
   formative functions of discursive feedback with the summative functions
   of traditional assessment, through participation in different forms of
   science discourse(s).

TI Comparing an inquiry-based approach known as the science writing
   heuristic to traditional science teaching practices: Are there
   differences?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SECONDARY SCIENCE; STUDENTS; ARGUMENTATION; LITERACY
AB Many state and federal governments have mandated in such documents as
   the National Science Education Standards that inquiry strategies should
   be the focus of the teaching of science within school classrooms. The
   difficult part for success is changing teacher practices from perceived
   traditional ways of teaching to more inquiry-based approaches.
   Arguments are often made about the effectiveness of these traditional
   strategies. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness
   of the inquiry-based approach known as the Science Writing Heuristic
   approach as a treatment to traditional teaching practices on students'
   post-test scores in relation to students' achievement level and
   teacher's implementation of the approach. A mixed-method research
   approach was used to analyze the teacher observational data and
   students' test results. The major findings of this study are that the
   quality of the implementation does have an impact on student
   performance on post-test scores and that high-quality implementation of
   the Science Writing Heuristic approach has significant advantages in
   closing the achievement gap within science classrooms.

TI A new educational perspective for teaching gravity
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; COGNITIVE CONFLICT; CHILDRENS IDEAS; SCIENCE;
   ANALOGIES; WEIGHT
AB Today's method of teaching the concept of falling bodies in French
   physics classes is ineffective, not only because it ignores the
   physical aspect of the phenomenon by addressing only its mathematical
   aspect, but also because it does not take into account students'
   initial conceptions, which are often incompatible with scientific
   knowledge. The goal of the present study was to assess the
   effectiveness of a new educational perspective for teaching gravity,
   based on an analogical presentation of Einstein's theory of the
   deformation of space-time. The conceptions of French 15-year-old ninth
   graders and how they evolve are analyzed and compared for two different
   teaching methods, the new perspective (n = 102) and an approach based
   on Newton's theory of bodies interacting at a distance. The data
   obtained are used to describe students' initial conceptions of falling
   bodies, and confirm the lesser effectiveness of the teaching approach
   based on Newton's theory. The results provide evidence of two phases of
   conceptual change: "positive substitution" (when a correct explanatory
   system replaces an erroneous one) and "generalization" (when the domain
   of validity of a correct explanatory system is extended). They also
   show that Einstein's theory can be understood by ninth graders and
   promotes more conceptual change than a method based on Newton's theory
   of bodies interacting at a distance. The new perspective appears to
   help students not only to extend the domain of validity of the correct
   conception - that bodies fall because they are attracted - but also to
   change their conception of attraction, now understood as the effect of
   a property of space rather than a property of bodies.

AB Evidence of a gap in student understanding has been well documented in
   chemistry: the typical student holds an abundance of misconceptions.
   The current expectation is that educational reform will foster greater
   student achievement via inquiry teaching within classrooms. Using
   assessments involving both conceptual and algorithmic knowledge of gas
   behaviour, gas laws, and phase changes in chemistry, this study aims to
   determine the relationship between inquiry teaching and student
   achievement. The topics were tested in the context of a unit from a
   reform-based curriculum that features inquiry, hands-on activities, and
   cooperative learning. This curriculum provides step-by-step guidance
   for each lesson in the teacher materials, in order to promote quality
   inquiry teaching. Two schools were involved in this study, with two
   high school chemistry teachers from each school. Each teacher
   participated in professional development and implemented this
   curriculum with sufficient training and guidance to develop reform
   methods. Student achievement was found to positively correlate with the
   use of inquiry teaching about the assessed concepts, regardless of
   teacher experience or school context.

SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES

ID GUIDANCE; DIALOGUE; CSCL
AB This article investigates the conditions under which diagrammatic
   representations support collaborative argumentation-based learning in a
   computer environment. Thirty dyads of 15- to 18-year-old students
   participated in a writing task consisting of 3 phases. Students
   prepared by constructing a representation (text or diagram)
   individually. Then they discussed the topic and wrote a text in dyads.
   They consolidated their knowledge by revising their individual
   representation. There were 3 conditions: Students could use either (a)
   the individual texts they wrote, (b) the individual diagrams they
   constructed, or (c) a diagram that was constructed for them based on
   the text they wrote. Results showed that students who constructed a
   diagram themselves explored the topic more than students in the other
   conditions. We also found differences in the way collaborating dyads
   used their representations. Dyads who engaged in deep discussion used
   their representations as a basis for knowledge construction. In
   contrast, dyads who engaged in only shallow discussion used their
   representations solely to copy information to their collaborative text.
   We conclude that diagrammatic representations can improve collaborative
   learning, but only when they are used in a co-constructive way.

TI To disagree, we must also agree: How intersubjectivity structures and
   perpetuates discourse in a mathematics classroom
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID TEACHER; COMMUNITY; CONVERSATION; VYGOTSKY
AB Learning in a socially mediated context like a classroom places
   emphasis on the ability of learners to communicate their ideas to
   others, and for members of a class to achieve shared meaning or
   intersubjectivity (IS). We take a participatory view of IS, where both
   consensual agreement and disagreement are regarded as aspects of a
   common set of processes that mediate collective activity. Interlocutors
   need not demonstrate convergence toward a common idea or solution to
   exhibit IS and, indeed, they appear to need a shared understanding to
   express substantive disagreement through divergent views. Multilevel,
   multimodal analyses of videotape of a middle school mathematics
   classroom, including speech, gestures, drawing, and object use, reveal
   a discourse that is organized into recurrent sequences of event triads.
   The dynamics toward and away from convergent ideas appears to be
   instrumental in fostering sustained and engaging discourse and
   influencing the representations that Students propose during problem
   solving. Participants frequently exhibited IS, but, as allowed for in
   the participatory view, the interactions did not seem to convert many
   students from their initial interpretations. Instead, disagreements and
   a desire to establish common understanding appeared to lead
   participants to express their divergent views in more refined and
   accessible ways. Advancement of our understanding of the role that IS
   serves in socially mediated learning has the potential to inform both
   educational theory and emerging areas in embodied cognition and
   cognitive neuroscience that addresses imitation and empathy, and thus
   help to bridge research between brain function and social cognition.

TI When the rules of discourse change, but nobody tells you: Making sense
   of mathematics learning from a commognitive standpoint
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID CLASSROOM; INSCRIPTIONS
AB The interpretive framework for the study of learning introduced in this
   article and called commognitive is grounded in the assumption that
   thinking is a form of communication and that learning mathematics is
   tantamount to modifying and extending one's discourse. These basic
   tenets lead to the conclusion that substantial discursive change,
   rather than being necessitated by an extradiscursive reality, is
   spurred by commognitive conflict, that is, by the situation that arises
   whenever different interlocutors are acting according to differing
   discursive rules. The framework is applied in 2 studies, one of them
   featuring a class learning about negative numbers and the other
   focusing on 2 first graders learning about triangles and
   quadrilaterals. In both cases, the analysis of data is guided by
   questions about (a) features of the new mathematical discourse that set
   it apart from the mathematical discourse in which the students were
   conversant when the learning began; (b) students' and teachers' efforts
   toward the necessary discursive transformation; and (c) effects of the
   learning-teaching process, that is, the extent of discursive change
   actually resulting from these efforts. One of the claims corroborated
   by the findings is that school learning requires an active lead of an
   experienced interlocutor and needs to be fueled by a learning-teaching
   agreement between the interlocutor and the learners.

AB This study reports findings from a 10-day professional development
   institute on curricular trends involving 19 secondary mathematics and
   science teachers and administrators from Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia,
   Thailand, Korea, Philippines, the United States, and People's Republic
   of China. Participants explored the roles of culture, place, and
   personal experience in science education through writings and group
   discussions. Initially, Asian participants tended to view indigenous
   knowledge and practices more negatively than U.S. peers. After a
   presentation on indigenous Hawaiian practices related to place and
   sustainability, they evaluated indigenous practices more positively and
   critiqued the absence of locally relevant science and indigenous
   knowledge in their national curricula. They identified local issues of
   traffic, air, and water quality they would like to address, and
   developed lessons addressing prior knowledge, place, and to a lesser
   extent, culture. These findings suggested critical professional
   development employing decolonizing methodologies articulated by
   indigenous researchers Abbott and Smith has the potential to raise
   teachers' awareness of the connections among personal and place-based
   experiences, cultural practices and values, and teaching and learning.
   An implication was the development of a framework for professional
   development able to shift science instruction toward meaningful,
   culture, place, and problem-based learning relevant to environmental
   literacy and sustainability. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study examined the impact of a professional development
   intervention aimed at helping elementary teachers incorporate elements
   of students' home language and culture into science instruction. The
   intervention consisted of instructional units and materials and teacher
   workshops. The research involved 43 third- and fourth-grade teachers at
   six elementary schools in a large urban school district. These teachers
   participated in the intervention for 2 consecutive years. The study was
   conducted using both quantitative and qualitative methods based on
   focus group interviews, a questionnaire, and classroom observations.
   The results indicate that as teachers began their participation in the
   intervention, they rarely incorporated students' home language or
   culture into science instruction. During the 2-year period of the
   intervention, teachers' beliefs and practices remained relatively
   stable and did not show significant change. Possible explanations for
   the limited effectiveness of the intervention are addressed, and
   implications for professional development efforts are discussed. (c)

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the ways in which elementary
   teachers applied their understanding of conceptual learning and
   teaching to their instructional practices as they became knowledgeable
   about conceptual change pedagogy. Teachers' various ways to interpret
   and utilize students' prior ideas were analyzed in both epistemological
   and ontological dimensions of learning. A total of 14 in-service
   elementary teachers conducted an 8-week-long inquiry into students'
   conceptual learning as a professional development course project. Major
   data sources included the teachers' reports on their students' prior
   ideas, lesson plans with justifications, student performance artifacts,
   video-recorded teaching episodes, and final reports on their analyses
   of student learning. The findings demonstrated three epistemologically
   distinct ways the teachers interpreted and utilized students' prior
   ideas. These supported Kinchin's epistemological categories of
   perspectives on teaching including positivist, misconceptions, and
   systems views. On the basis of Chi's and Thagard's theories of
   conceptual change, the teachers' ontological understanding of
   conceptual learning was differentiated in two ways. Some teachers
   taught a unit to change the ontological nature of student ideas,
   whereas the others taught a unit within the same ontological categories
   of student ideas. The findings about teachers' various ways of
   utilizing students' prior ideas in their instructional practices
   suggested a number of topics to be addressed in science teacher
   education such as methods of utilizing students' cognitive resources,
   strategies for purposeful use of counter-evidence, and understanding of
   ontological demands of learning. Future research questions were
   suggested. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This article investigates three teachers' conceptions and use of
   inquiry-based instructional strategies throughout a professional
   development program. The professional development program consisted of
   a 2-week summer inquiry institute and research experience in university
   scientists' laboratories, as well as three academic year workshops.
   Insights gained from an in-depth study of these three secondary
   teachers resulted in a model of teacher conceptions that can be used to
   direct future inquiry professional development. Teachers' conceptions
   of inquiry teaching were established through intensive case-study
   research that incorporated extensive classroom observations and
   interviews. Through their participation in the professional development
   experience, the teachers gained a deeper understanding of how to
   implement inquiry practices in their classrooms. The teachers gained
   confidence and practice with inquiry methods through developing and
   presenting their institute-developed inquiry lessons, through observing
   other teachers' lessons, and participating as students in the workshop
   inquiry activities. Data analysis revealed that a set of four core
   conceptions guided the teachers' use of inquiry-based practices in
   their classrooms. The teachers' conceptions of science, their students,
   effective teaching practices, and the purpose of education influenced
   the type and amount of inquiry instruction performed in the high school
   classrooms. The research findings suggest that to be successful inquiry
   professional development must not only teach inquiry knowledge, but it
   must also assess and address teachers' core teaching conceptions. (c)

AB This study investigated the national impact of the Collaboratives for
   Excellence in Teacher Preparation program (CETP). Impact of the program
   was examined in two different settings: institutions of higher
   education, and K-12 science and mathematics classrooms. The focus of
   this study was to determine the impact of the CETP program on the
   institutional culture and collaborations among faculty, and changes in
   instructional techniques used by higher education faculty and K-12
   teachers. Data were gathered over a 3-year period from 12 different
   CETP projects. At the higher education level faculty reported more
   collaboration and a slight increase in the use of standard-based
   teaching. At the K-12 level, students of teachers who were prepared by
   the CETP program viewed classroom instruction as slightly more
   standards-based than comparable students of non-CETP prepared teachers.
   Additionally, external observers rated classes taught by teachers
   educated in CETP projects as more standards-based than classes taught
   by non-CETP teachers educated in other programs. Implications of the
   results for national large-scale reform of science and mathematics
   education are discussed. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study explored the dynamics of power relationships in secondary
   science methods courses taught at an urban university in Southern
   California for credential candidates. Data collection extended over 10
   academic semesters. Employing frameworks of power, self-study, and
   critical pedagogy, the study analyzes the multifaceted and intricate
   roads (or multimirrored reflections) of an instructor on her way to
   becoming a transformative intellectual. Findings suggested that power
   sources and their use may vary according to the credential candidates'
   needs and the demands and perceptions of the different tasks performed
   in class. Perceptions of the instructor's goals and perceived attitudes
   during classroom tasks seemed to relate to power shifts ultimately
   influencing classroom dynamics. The major implications of this study
   was to reemphasize the acute need for instructor self-studies in
   science education as a way of improving practice and fulfilling the
   demands of the changing and challenging science credential candidate
   population as well as their K-12 students. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals,

AB The museum visit is an important part of elementary school science
   teaching. However, a divide exists between teachers, who require
   curricular accountability, and museums, who emphasize free-choice
   exploration. Can a carefully constructed worksheet bridge this divide
   by providing free-choice exploration of curricular topics during the
   museum visit? In the present study, a theoretical framework was
   constructed to inform the design of worksheets as free-choice learning
   devices. This framework was used to analyze the design of an existing
   museum worksheet. Subsequently, curriculum-related conversations among
   school groups visiting a museum were monitored in groups supplied with
   the worksheet and in control groups without. Overall, the worksheet
   complied well with design criteria synthesized from the free-choice
   learning literature. Furthermore, the use of the worksheet increased
   the number and diversity of curriculum-related conversations among
   school groups during the visit. This study documents that the use of
   carefully designed worksheets may increase students' exposure to
   curriculum during a museum visit, and thus may help build better
   bridges between teacher needs and museum free-choice identities. (c)

AB This paper will present a review of design-based research conducted
   over the past 10 years that has modeled and promoted students'
   reasoning, conceptual change and argumentative dialogue processes and
   practices through designing a number of digital dialogue games. This
   line of work was inspired by some challenges and insights that emerged
   during projects dealing with conceptual change in science. Since then,
   the dialogical and pedagogical requirements for improved reasoning,
   knowledge development and conceptual understanding in a range of
   contexts have been addressed through projects that have designed and
   evaluated intelligent and highly interactive dialogue game tools, such
   as CoLLeGE (Computer-based Laboratory for Language Games in Education),
   AcademicTalk and InterLoc (Collaborative Interaction through
   scaffolding Locutions). This article will review this line of work
   through justifying and describing the rationale for its trajectory
   before presenting ongoing work that synthesizes and operationalizes its
   findings and insights. The ongoing work emphasizes an inclusive and
   personalized approach to learning dialogue that stimulates reasoning,
   collaborative thinking and the development of argumentative dialogue
   practices. This is arguably relevant to most learning contexts, and
   especially to contemporary science education. Finally, conclusions are

AB A computer-assisted music-learning system (CAMLS) has been developed to
   help the hearing impaired practice playing a musical melody. The
   music-learning performance is evaluated to test the usability of the
   system. This system can be a computer-supported learning tool for the
   hearing impaired to help them understand what pitch and tempo are, and
   then learn to play songs thereby increasing their interest in music
   classes and enhancing their learning performance. The results indicated
   that CAMLS could enhance hearing-impaired students' learning
   performance in a music course. A questionnaire survey also demonstrated
   that the computer-aided method did benefit hearing-impaired students in
   their music leaning. Actually, this system can also be applied to
   non-disabled students as a music-supportive tool to help their music
   learning.

AB This research aims to use hierarchical topic maps to compile digital
   learning material and to discuss its design and application
   possibilities. The system renders tremendous original assets and then
   embeds a self-organizing map (SOM) in the material database to produce
   topical learning materials, as in this case, an illustration through
   Chinese herb medication. It helps to demonstrate robust professional
   information as well as knowledge structures, and provides a customized
   and interactive learning dynamic to support both progressive and
   constructive learning styles.
   The paper first gives a detailed procedural description of the material
   construction, explains how topic map techniques were applied, and
   observes the implications and potentials of the technology to education.
   Both the technical and educational evaluations of using SOM topic maps
   in compilation of learning materials have resulted in positive
   feedback. SOM allows users to review the complete databank in
   structural hierarchical order, which provides comprehensive
   understanding of the entire set of learning materials, and also brings
   opportunities to users to discover knowledge related to their study
   area.

ID COMPUTER-SIMULATIONS; CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; INSTRUCTION
AB This paper proposes a reconsideration of use of computer simulations in
   science education. We discuss three studies of the use of science
   simulations for undergraduate distance learning students. The first
   one, The Driven Pendulum simulation is a computer-based experiment on
   the behaviour of a pendulum. The second simulation, Evolve is concerned
   with natural selection in a hypothetical species of a flowering plant.
   The third simulation, The Double Slit Experiment deals with electron
   diffraction and students are provided with an experimental setup to
   investigate electron diffraction for double and single slit
   arrangements. We evaluated each simulation, with 30 students each for
   The Driven Pendulum and Evolve simulations and about 100 students for
   The Double Slit Experiment. From these evaluations we have developed a
   set of the features for the effective use of simulations in distance
   learning. The features include student support, multiple
   representations and tailorability.

DE affordance; epistemology; knowledge; meaning; perception
ID MIND
AB The issues raised by the design and development of technologies to
   enhance learning has led to a demand for an appropriate language and
   form of conceptualization. However, we are insufficiently familiar with
   the way in which different types of mediated tool use occur, to develop
   the theoretical models needed for the development of this language and
   form of conceptualization. In its absence a somewhat eclectic variety
   of concepts and research, such as the concept of affordance, are
   recruited in accounts of learning with new technologies. In looking
   briefly at the relevant area in philosophy this paper will consider
   whether or not the use of concepts such as affordance give adequate
   weight to social practice, meaning and knowledge in the design of
   educational technology. A fruitful source for work in this field which
   has not been sufficiently exploited is philosophy, particularly recent
   work in epistemology.

AB This paper investigates and compares the utilization of online
   resources to support teaching and learning in two different educational
   sectors with overlapping student groups in Scotland: secondary schools
   and further education (FE) colleges. The online 'Core Skills' materials
   included Numeracy, Communication, Information Technology (IT), Problem
   Solving and Working With Others. The research involved two large-scale
   national surveys with representative samples of staff drawn from
   secondary schools and FE colleges, and four qualitative case studies
   purposively selected to represent a range of geographic locations. The
   most popular resources were for Numeracy. In the majority of colleges,
   respondents' attitudes to the materials were positive and the
   e-resources were used in conjunction with other teaching approaches.
   The evidence suggested that less motivated learners benefited from the
   materials when they were contextualized. Among secondary teacher
   respondents, however, the resources were virtually unknown. The
   majority of secondary teachers reported that they needed time to
   evaluate the materials and that they would benefit from specific
   training related to curriculum-linked e-resources. In conclusion, as
   the Numeracy materials have been found useful, e-learning in
   mathematics warrants further investigation among less motivated
   students who are currently not achieving their potential in secondary
   schools.

AB The aim of the paper is to integrate notions of the improvement of
   student learning through a focus on the concept of engagement, and adds
   to that broader discussion through a recent empirical study of the
   perceptions of students gathered through a case study in a UK
   university. It is proposed that student engagement lies on a continuum
   from disengaged to engaged, and also exists at a number of levels
   within which the same student may exhibit different degrees of
   engagement. We argue that if the built-in alienating influences within
   higher education are to be countered, multi-faceted engagement is
   required. Learners, we conclude, are more likely to engage if they in
   turn are supported by teaching staff who engage with: students, with
   the subject, and with the teaching process, and furthermore that the
   classroom teacher requires support in achieving this.

ID PLAGIARISM
AB This paper reports on the first part of a recent research study into
   current initiatives to support the learning of non-English speaking
   background (NESB) transnational students in Asia who are studying
   off-shore at Australian universities. Learning support and development
   staff in 12 universities were surveyed using a questionnaire. The
   survey yielded data on the varied modes of learning support for
   transnational students, many of which are Web-based; their perceived
   effectiveness; their evaluation status and the number and nature of
   those with a focus on assisting students to avoid plagiarism. The
   questionnaire elicited responses about future plans, challenges and
   barriers in relation to the effective learning support of transnational
   students. Critical themes to emerge were: the importance of
   person-to-person contact; embedding of learning resources into course
   delivery; interventions to assist students to avoid plagiarism that
   acknowledge cultural factors; the need for planning, professional
   development; adequate resources and attitudinal change.

   history as part of the political science curriculum today, ranging from
   'what to teach' to 'how to teach'. Assuming the necessity in
   contemporary information society of selecting information rather than
   only accessing it, we propose approaches, such as topics networking, to
   create political arguments by using historical facts. We also propose
   successfully tested teaching methods, such as facilitation and
   hermeneutical procedure, aimed at upgrading lecturer-student
   interaction and equipping students with precious communication skills.

AB Podcasting has become a popular medium for accessing and assimilating
   information and podcasts are increasingly being used to deliver audio
   recordings of lectures to campus-based students. This paper describes a
   simple, cost-effective and file size-efficient method for producing
   video podcasts combining lecture slides and audio without a requirement
   for any specialist software. The results from a pilot scheme delivering
   supplementary lecture materials as audio and video podcasts are also
   presented, including data on download patterns and responses to a
   survey of students on podcast use. These results reveal students'
   enthusiasm for podcast recordings of lecture materials and their
   primary use by students in revision and preparation for assessments.
   Survey responses also suggest little likely impact on lecture
   attendance as a consequence of podcasting, but indicate that podcast
   recordings of lectures may not be effective in facilitating mobile
   leaming.

ID NURSE TEACHER; STUDENTS; PATIENT; GAP; MODEL; CARE
AB In health care education a balance needs to be struck between
   theoretical and practical teaching. Undergraduates typically split
   their time between clinical placement and university-based teaching
   blocks. A proportion of the time spent in preparation for clinical
   practice placements will be spent in the classroom or in simulation
   suites. The challenge to engage students in clinical skills education
   in this environment can be met by providing locally created video
   sequences showing the application of what is being taught in the
   clinical environment. This paper describes how Mini-DV format video
   cameras can be used to provide a practical way to gather this material.
   Also described is how the video is edited, stored and used.

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB The study described in this paper outlines an attempt to explore those
   factors that contribute to learning performance improvement in
   laboratory instruction. As a case study, the educational methodology
   involved in a basic microcontroller course was analyzed. Traditional
   lab sessions based on the control of peripherals with low interactivity
   have been replaced with new sessions based on mobile technology and the
   Short Message Service (SMS). This allows the development of greater
   interactivity and the provision of more motivating features. Using the
   key tenets of the three basic learning theories (behaviorist,
   cognitivist and constructivist) and the notion of interactivity as
   causal factors, the study described in this paper presents a
   performance learning model based on the theory of reasoned action. This
   learning model identifies the variables with a significant influence on
   the learning performance, allowing a statistical analysis to quantify
   their influence. The results obtained demonstrate the important roles
   of interactivity and motivating features in a laboratory instruction
   from both a qualitative and a quantitative point of view.

TI Gender differences in introductory university physics performance: The
   influence of high school physics preparation and affective factors

AB The attrition of females studying physics after high school is a
   growing concern to the science education community. Most undergraduate
   science programs require introductory physics coursework. Thus, success
   in introductory physics is usually necessary for students to progress
   to higher levels of science study. Success also influences attitudes;
   if females are well prepared, feel confident, and do well in
   introductory physics, they may be inclined to study physics further.
   This quantitative study using a hierarchical linear model focused on
   determining factors from high school physics preparation (content,
   pedagogy, and assessment) and the affective domain that predicted
   female and male performance in introductory university physics. The
   data analyzed came from 1973 introductory university physics surveys
   that included variables used as controls for student demographic and
   academic background characteristics. The results highlight high school
   physics and affective experiences that differentially predicted female
   and male performance. These experiences include learning requirements,
   long-written problems, cumulative tests/quizzes, father's
   encouragement, and family's belief that science leads to a better
   career. There were also factors that had a similar effect on female and
   male performance among which mathematics preparation was the overall
   strongest predictor of university physics performance.

AB In this paper, instructional strategies for sustaining model-based
   inquiry in an undergraduate chemistry class were analyzed through data
   collected from classroom observations, a student survey, and in-depth
   problem-solving sessions with the instructor and students. Analysis of
   teacher-student interactions revealed a cyclical pattern in which
   students generated, evaluated, and modified (GEM) hypotheses throughout
   the course. It is hypothesized that sustained involvement in the GEM
   cycle contributed to students' engagement with scientific inquiry and
   model construction and revision. As such, GEM represents a promising
   approach toward achieving process and content goals in the
   undergraduate chemistry classroom.

TI Item readability and science achievement in TIMSS 2003 in South Africa
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID LANGUAGE; MATHEMATICS; PERFORMANCE; SCHOOLS
AB This study investigated the relationship between readability of 73
   text-only multiple-choice questions from Trends in International
   Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003 and performance of two
   groups of South African learners: those with limited English-language
   proficiency (learners attending African schools) and those with better
   English-language proficiency (learners attending non-African schools).
   Both groups were exposed to the same intended curriculum, but differed
   with respect to the quality of teaching they received, the availability
   of resources, and the level of functionality of their schools. Learners
   from non-African schools performed significantly better than learners
   from African schools. Three readability factors (sentence complexity,
   unfamiliar words, and long words) were analyzed. High sentence
   complexity resulted in random guessing in non-African schools, and
   favoring an incorrect answer in African schools. Some TIMSS items have
   complex wording, with numerous prepositional phrases and clauses, and
   unclear questions. Recommendations for maximum readability and
   comprehensibility were not met, and these items are therefore invalid
   for learners with limited English-language proficiency. Learners employ
   a range of strategies in attempting to answer questions that they do
   not understand. Overall, though, poor readability of TIMSS items does
   not fully account for South African learners' poor performance in TIMSS.

TI Keeping the local local: Recalibrating the status of science and
   traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) in education
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE; SOCKEYE-SALMON; UNIVERSALISM; MULTICULTURALISM;
   SEARCH
AB The debate on the status of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) in
   science curricula is currently centered on a juxtaposition of two
   incompatible frameworks: multiculturalism and universalism. The aim of
   this paper is to establish a framework that overcomes this opposition
   between multiculturalism and universalism in science education, so that
   they become but one-sided expressions of an integrated unit. To be able
   to do so, we abandon the concept of "truth." Instead, we adopt a
   contemporary epistemology that (a) entails both the cultural and
   material aspects of human, intersubjective reality; (b) concerns the
   usefulness of knowledge; and (c) highlights the dynamic, heterogeneous,
   and plural nature of products of human being and understanding. Drawing
   on narratives of scientists and aboriginal people explaining a
   comparable natural phenomenon (a salmon run), we show that both TEK and
   scientific knowledge, though simultaneously available, are
   incommensurable and irreducible to each other, as are the different
   processes of knowledge construction/evolution inherent to the
   constituting artifacts. Drawing on social studies of science, we point
   out that the transcendent nature of scientific knowledge implies
   absence of local heterogeneity, dynamic, and plurality making it
   useless in local contexts other than itself. We discuss the educational
   implications of this recalibration.

AB This case study describes a teacher's development of and creativity in
   manipulating physical models in an astronomy course for in-service
   science teachers of K-8. Specifically, she organized a data table from
   several charts of numbers, constructed a moon-ball model in addition to
   a 2-D model, and created a hula hoop model as a concrete realization of
   her mental model. Examination of the transformation and construction
   processes revealed how she revised existing models and added new
   elements. These reconstruction experiences afforded her with a higher
   level of comprehension and self-awareness of her mental models. Three
   of the teacher's actions contributed to her increased understanding and
   deployment of the models: she enhanced her autonomy by changing the
   given models and solving problems she was interested in; she
   communicated with her partners and shared her knowledge by
   materializing her models; and she constructed new models on the basis
   of her experience. This case study shows that the transformation
   process, especially a cascade of small steps with the emergence of a
   more dramatic departure, is a key to generating scientific knowledge.

TI Educational value of different types of exhibits in an interactive
   science and technology center
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MUSEUM; SIMILARITY; LIGHT; MODEL
AB This study analyzes the short-term consequences of visitors' use of
   different types of exhibits (i.e., "exemplars of phenomena" and
   "analogy based") together with the factors affecting visitors'
   understanding of and their evaluation of the use of such exhibits. One
   hundred and twenty five visitors (either alone or in groups) were
   observed during their interaction and interviewed immediately
   afterwards. Findings suggest that the type of exhibit constrains the
   nature of the understanding achieved. The use of analogical reasoning
   may lead to an intended causal explanation of an exhibit that is an
   exemplar of a phenomenon, but visitors often express misconceptions as
   a consequence of using this type of exhibit. Analogy-based exhibits are
   often not used as intended by the designer. This may be because
   visitors do not access the source domain intended; are unaware of the
   use of analogy per se (in particular, when the exhibit is of the
   subtype "only showing similarities between relationships"); only
   acquire fragmentary knowledge about the target; or fail to use
   analogical reasoning of which they were capable. Furthermore, exhibits
   related to everyday world situations are recognized to have an
   immediate educative value for visitors. Suggestions for enhancing the
   educative value of exhibits are proposed.

DT Article
ID PARADIGM; BEHAVIOR
AB Over the last few decades, environmental work has increased
   significantly. An important part of this has to do with attitudes. This
   research presents the design and validation of an environmental
   attitudes scale aimed at university students. Detailed information on
   development and validation of the scale is provided. Similarly, it
   presents the data derived from its application to a specimen group of
   students. The number of students involved in the whole research is 952.
   The results of the work show that a certain level of worry exists among
   the students regarding environmental problems, which is apparent in the
   need to increase environmental education and research. Some differences
   in environmental attitudes were also found between first year students
   and final year students and male and female students. These results
   lead us to insist on the importance of bringing about changes in the
   curriculum to increase environmentalism in the university.

AB Mixed methods research conducted across three semesters in introductory
   college geology classes (n = 187, 190, 138) attempted to ascertain
   whether integrated study of petrified wood could serve as a portal to
   improved student geobiological understanding of fossilization, geologic
   time, and evolution. The Petrified Wood Survey(TM) was administered as
   a preinstructional and postinstructional assessment in control and
   experimental classes; the experimental class received integrated
   petrified wood instruction. Paired t tests of differences in students'
   pre- and postinstructional scores for control and experimental groups
   revealed significance (alpha = 0.05, effect size = 0.79, confidence
   interval 0.56-1.01). The students with integrative study showed greater
   knowledge gains about petrified wood's abundance, properties, nature,
   location, and geologic time. However, understanding of fossilization
   geochemistry remained problematic for both groups. 0 2006 Wiley

   equation model between the freshmen's physics achievement and selected
   affective characteristics related to physics. These characteristics are
   students' situational interest in physics, personal interest in
   physics, aspiring extra activities related to physics, importance of
   physics, importance of electricity, physics course anxiety, physics
   test anxiety, physics achievement motivation, student motivation in
   physics, self-efficacy in physics, self-concept in physics, and locus
   of control. The researchers developed the affective characteristics
   questionnaire that consisted of 12 subdimensions, and has 53 items
   related to these subdimensions. The questionnaire was applied to 890
   freshmen physics students at the universities in Ankara. Two models
   were tested: a unidimensional model and a multidimensional model.
   However, a third model, which is more similar to the multidimensional
   model, exhibited the best fit for the freshmen. Moreover, the results
   revealed that achievement motivation was the most influential affective
   characteristic on physics achievement. On the other hand, motivation in
   physics had a negative influence on physics achievement in the model,
   and the influence of the students' attitudes towards physics was not
   statistically significant. Thus, one should especially pay attention to
   the students' achievement motivation in physics if the aim is to
   increase students' physics achievement. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study exemplifies how faculty members can develop instruments to
   assess affective responses of students to the specific features of the
   courses they teach. Means for assessing three types of affective
   responses are demonstrated: (a) student attitudes towards courses with
   differing instructional objectives and methodologies, (b) student
   self-efficacy (confidence) in completing tasks common to practicing
   experts, and (c) interests in subject-specific topics and associated
   intellectual skills. The iterative processes used in refining the
   instruments and performing the statistical analyses of their
   effectiveness are detailed. An analysis of data obtained using these
   instruments is also included. Positive attitudes towards courses
   emphasizing analytical thinking increased significantly over the course
   of a 14-week semester, as did the measures of self-efficacy. Despite
   the rigorous analytical nature of the course experience, the initial
   strong interest in cell biology topics and higher order thinking skills
   remained unchanged. There were no significant differences based on
   gender in any of the affective measures. We discuss the apparent
   dichotomy, revealed in these assessments, between students' idealistic,
   academic attitudes towards the course's effectiveness and their
   opinions of its effects on them personally. We conclude by reporting
   how insights garnered both from these formal assessments and from
   anecdotal communications have prompted experimental modifications in
   the design and conduct of the course. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB A theoretical model of nonscience majors' motivation to learn science
   was tested by surveying 369 students in a large-enrollment college
   science course that satisfies a core curriculum requirement. Based on a
   social-cognitive framework, motivation to learn science was
   conceptualized as having both cognitive and affective influences that
   foster science achievement. Structural equation modeling was used to
   examine the hypothesized relationships among the variables. The
   students' motivation, as measured by the Science Motivation
   Questionnaire (SMQ), had a strong direct influence on their
   achievement, as measured by their science grade point average. The
   students' motivation was influenced by their belief in the relevance of
   science to their careers. This belief was slightly stronger in women
   than men. Essays by the students and interviews with them provided
   insight into their motivation. The model suggests that instructors
   should strategically connect science concepts to the careers of
   nonscience majors through such means as case studies to increase
   motivation and achievement. (C) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB To enhance the learning outcomes achieved by students, learners
   undertook a computer-simulated activity based on an acid-base titration
   prior to a university-level chemistry laboratory activity. Students
   were categorized with respect to their attitudes toward learning.
   During the laboratory exercise, questions that students asked their
   assistant teachers were used as indicators of cognitive focus. During
   the interviews, students' frequency and level of "spontaneous" use of
   chemical knowledge served as an indicator of knowledge usability.
   Results suggest that the simulation influenced students toward posing
   more theoretical questions during their laboratory work and, regardless
   of attitudes, exhibiting a more complex, correct use of chemistry
   knowledge in their interviews. A more relativistic student attitude
   toward learning was positively correlated with interview performance in
   both the control and treatment groups. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Students' views about science were correlated with their approaches to
   lab practice. Three distinct cases are discussed in detail:
   empiricist-oriented, rationalist-oriented, and constructivist-oriented
   students. A coherent epistemological theory was constructed for each
   case, by considering the different degrees of certainty and confidence
   each student attributed to theoretical versus experimental knowledge in
   science. These theories could explain the difference between the
   students' methods of preparation for the lab session and their
   approaches to writing the lab report. It was shown that overconfidence
   in one type of knowledge led to oversimplification of the relation
   between theory and evidence. Findings suggest that epistemological
   theories play a crucial role in determining whether and how students
   coordinate theory and empirical evidence in their lab practice.
   Inspecting and correcting students' lab reports in accordance with
   these findings can offer an easy way to identify students'
   epistemological theories and to provide appropriate feedback. (C) 2007

AB This study explores effects of participation by second-semester college
   general chemistry students in an extended, open-inquiry laboratory
   investigation. Verbal interactions among a student lab team and with
   their instructor over three open-inquiry laboratory sessions and two
   non-inquiry sessions were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. Coding
   categories were developed using the constant comparison method.
   Findings indicate that, during open-inquiry activities, the student
   team interacted less often, sought less instructor guidance, and talked
   less about chemistry concepts than during their non-inquiry activities.
   Evidence suggests that the students employed science process skills and
   engaged in higher-order thinking during both types of laboratory
   activities. Implications for including open-inquiry experiences in
   general chemistry laboratory programs on student understanding of
   science as inquiry are discussed. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In this study, we develop a model of science identity to make sense of
   the science experiences of 15 successful women of color over the course
   of their undergraduate and graduate studies in science and into
   science-related careers. In our view, science identity accounts both
   for how women make meaning of science experiences and how society
   structures possible meanings. Primary data included ethnographic
   interviews during students' undergraduate careers, follow-up interviews
   6 years later, and ongoing member-checking. Our results highlight the
   importance of recognition by others for women in the three science
   identity trajectories: research scientist; altruistic scientist; and
   disrupted scientist. The women with research scientist identities were
   passionate about science and recognized themselves and were recognized
   by science faculty as science people. The women with altruistic
   scientist identities regarded science as a vehicle for altruism and
   created innovative meanings of "science," "recognition by others," and
   "woman of color in science." The women with disrupted scientist
   identities sought, but did not often receive, recognition by meaningful
   scientific others. Although they were ultimately successful, their
   trajectories were more difficult because, in part, their bids for
   recognition were disrupted by the interaction with gendered, ethnic,
   and racial factors. This study clarifies theoretical conceptions of
   science identity, promotes a rethinking of recruitment and retention
   efforts, and illuminates various ways women of color experience, make
   meaning of, and negotiate the culture of science. (C) 2007 Wiley

AB This study examined the processes of change in thinking as a means of
   learning about the professional development of two science teacher
   educators. A qualitative methodology was used. The main research tool
   was a semistructured in-depth interview. The primary data analyzed came
   from two science teacher educators, selected from a broader set of
   seven. Findings emphasize the importance of questions regarding the
   knowledge possessed by teacher educators and of the questions regarding
   the role of science teacher educators. That is, the knowledge of an
   expert science teacher educator was more than a list of givens; it was
   personal and context-bound. This study contributes new insight into the
   processes of teacher educators' professional development and change in
   their thinking. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB There is growing concern over graduating trainee teachers' insufficient
   level of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literacy. The
   main purpose of this research was to describe the nature of trainee
   teachers' ICT literacy at the beginning of preservice training: (a) to
   explore the structure and to identify the main components of
   ICT-related capabilities, and (b) to examine possible relationships
   between these components. Data from trainee teachers' ICT literacy
   self-assessment survey were examined using exploratory and confirmatory
   factor analysis. Two elements of ICT-related general cognitive
   capabilities and three elements of technical capabilities were
   identified, respectively: (a) problem solving, (b) communication and
   metacognition, (c) basic ICT capabilities, (d) analysis and production
   with ICT, (e) information and Internet-related capabilities. It was
   found that general cognitive and technical capabilities are two
   separate areas of ICT literacy; however basic ICT capabilities are an
   important component of both areas.

AB The focus of this study was to understand knowledge flows among
   teachers by examining what types of knowledge was shared by teachers,
   as well as what motivates or hinders teachers to share knowledge
   online. We examined an electronic mailing list (listserv) supporting a
   community of practice of literacy teachers. Data were gathered on the
   teachers in the listserv through online observations. Additional data
   were collected through semi-structured telephone interviews with 20
   teachers. Findings suggest that two motives of community
   involvement--collectivism, and principlism appear to be the main
   motivators for knowledge sharers to share knowledge, while lack of
   knowledge and competing priority appear to be the main barriers.
   Practical implications for knowledge sharing and suggestions for future
   research are discussed. The findings of this study inform teachers,
   listserv moderators, teacher associations, as well as researchers of
   educational technology who are interested in knowledge sharing among
   teachers within communities of practice mediated by computer networks.

AB This article describes the development and evaluation of STARstreams, a
   pilot effort to utilize videos and online discussions in a conflict
   resolution curriculum that acknowledges the inherent socio-personal
   aspects of conflict. The STARstreams curricula includes a set of
   video-based scenarios depicting conflict situations and potential
   resolutions to those conflicts, a web-based conferencing system for
   cross-classroom discussion of the scenarios, and a handbook to guide
   teacher implementation of the curriculum. These materials were
   evaluated in a 2-week field trial with four geographically diverse 5th
   and 6th grade classrooms. The experimental STARstreams curriculum was
   well-received by participating students and teachers, engendered
   extensive participation in online discussions about the scenarios, and
   had a statistically significant effect on measures of social problem
   solving, self-efficacy toward conflict resolution, and perceived value
   and satisfaction with the materials. The overall program and its
   development are described; classroom experiences, online discussion,
   and quantitative outcome measures are presented; and implications for
   future efforts are discussed.

ID CONTINUING MOTIVATION
AB This study investigated self-presentation bias in the self-reports of
   teachers about their practices in six topic areas in educational
   technology (Instructional Design, Assessment, Learner-Centered
   Instruction, Curriculum Alignment, Attitudes about Computers, and Use
   of Computers with Students). Subjects were 50 middle-school teachers.
   Data were collected using a 30-item Likert-type survey containing five
   items per topic area. Teachers responded to items in two forms: "what I
   do" and "what other teachers do." Significant differences favoring the
   "I" form were obtained in three of the six areas (Instructional Design,
   Learner-Centered Instruction, and Curriculum Alignment) and on nine of
   the 30 items, indicating a rather strong self-presentation bias.
   Responses were generally positive across both forms. Results are
   discussed with implications for working with teachers and for using
   additional assessment measures that complement teacher self-reports.

ID DESIGN; TOOLS
AB The development of instructional software is a complex process, posing
   high demands to the technical and didactical expertise of developers.
   Domain specialists rather than professional developers are often
   responsible for it, but authoring tools with pre-structured templates
   claim to compensate for this limited experience. This study compares
   instructional software products made by developers with low production
   experience (n = 6) and high production experience (n = 8), working with
   a template-based authoring tool. It is hypothesized that those with
   high production experience will be more productive and create software
   with a higher didactical quality than those with low production
   experience, whereas no differences with regard to technical and
   authoring quality are expected. The results show that the didactical
   quality was unsatisfactory and did not differ between groups.
   Nevertheless the templates compensated for differences in experience
   because the technical and authoring quality was equal for both groups,
   indicating that templates enable domain specialists to participate
   successfully in the production process.

ID VISIONS
AB Since the advent of technologies available for teaching and learning,
   schools have been advocating considerable amount of their funds for the
   procurement of hi-tech technologies. Despite this huge investment,
   there is a little success achieved so far. It is obvious that
   technology integration is a complex and demanding issues and this puts
   more burdens on schools. On the other hand, technology planning, as a
   process and product, holds a number of promises to overcome those
   problems. Thus, the purpose of this present study was to illustrate how
   technology planning process was carried out in a private K-12 school in
   Turkey. Data were collected from 105 teachers, 25 administrative staff,
   and 376 students. Teachers and administrative staff were asked to fill
   out a questionnaire to gather data on their perceived computer
   literacy, issues related to ICT usage. Students were also asked about
   their perceptions on the current utilization of ICT at their school.
   Additionally, unstructured interviews were conducted with
   administrative staff and teachers to validate data obtained through
   questionnaires. Data were descriptively analyzed to provide necessary
   input for the technology planning process. Findings indicated that even
   teachers and administrator staff felt themselves competent in using ICT
   available at the school; they reported a lack of guidelines that would
   lead them to successful integration. On the other hand, students
   reported that ICT is not utilized sufficiently in their classes.
   Finally, the study illustrated how necessary data were collected and
   findings were transformed into suggestions to frame a technology plan
   for a school. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   structural and measurement model for the technological acceptance (TAM)
   of a web-based educational tool. The aim consists of measuring not only
   the use of this tool, but also the external variables with a
   significant influence in its use for planning future improvements. The
   tool, designed with Shockwave (TM) and Macromedia Director (TM), is a
   web-based educational environment that has been applied as a teaching
   methodology in an undergraduate course involved with modern
   microprocessors architectures and applications. The proposed
   methodology may be extensible to similar tools and tries to fill the
   lack of scientific studies in the validation and acceptance of
   computer-based educational tools. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This study evaluates the reliability of self-assessment as a measure of
   computer competence. This evaluation is carried out in response to
   recent research which has employed self-reported ratings as the sole
   indicator of students' computer competence. To evaluate the reliability
   of self-assessed computer competence, the scores achieved by students
   in self-assessed computer competence tests are compared with scores
   achieved in objective tests. The results reveal a statistically
   significantly over-estimation of computer competence among the students
   surveyed. Furthermore, reported pre-university computer experience in
   terms of home and school use and formal IT education does not affect
   this result. The findings call into question the validity of using
   self-assessment as a measure of computer competence. More generally,
   the study also provides an up-to-date picture of self-reported computer
   usage and IT experience among pre-university students from New Zealand
   and South-east Asia and contrasts these findings with those from
   previous research. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aims at highlighting the collaborative activity of two high
   school students (age 14) in the cases of modeling the complex
   biological process of plant growth with two different tools: the 'paper
   & pencil' concept mapping technique and the computer-supported
   educational environment 'Models Creator'. Students' shared activity in
   both cases is carried out in the presence of a facilitator providing
   technical as well as cognitive support when necessary. The objective of
   the study is to highlight the ways in which the collaborating students
   are engaged in the plant growth modeling activity in the two cases and
   also identify the activity's similar and different aspects in each one.
   Our analysis is carried out on two complementary axes, the first of
   which concerns the process of collaboratively creating a plant growth
   model with each different tool, while the second has to do with the
   students' conceptualizations of the biological aspect of the modeling
   task in each case. A two-level analytic tool for the modeling process
   has been derived within the theoretical framework of 'activity theory'
   on the basis of the OCAF scheme for basic modeling operations and the
   scheme of Stratford et al. [Stratford, S. J., Krajcik, J., & Soloway,
   E. (1998). Secondary students' dynamic modeling processes: analyzing,
   reasoning about, synthesizing, and testing models of stream ecosystems.

   and cognitive support) performed through a plethora of modeling
   operations define the steps of the modeling process in both cases,
   while specific qualitative differences can be actually identified.
   Finally, the students' conceptualizations of the biological aspect of
   the modeling task in the two-case activity is analyzed in regard with
   their capability of shifting reasoning between macro- and micro-levels,
   while educational implications are also discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier

AB The paper reports on the outcomes of a British Educational
   Communications and Technology Agency (BECTa) funded study which
   explored the views of teacher trainees and their mentors in two
   different school subjects on what strategies, interventions and
   resources had a positive impact on their ability to use ICT effectively
   in their subject teaching.
   The research aimed to explore both commonalities in trainees' views of
   which strategies and interventions had a positive influence on their
   ability to use ICT effectively in subject teaching, and subject
   discipline dimensions of ICT use, i.e. the ways in which training needs
   might vary between trainees in different school subjects.
   The study focused on the views of two successive cohorts of science and
   history trainees (133 trainees in all), and 21 of their supervising
   mentors. The outcomes showed that some important determinants of
   progression in the ability to deploy ICT confidently and effectively in
   subject teaching were common to both subject groups, but that there
   were differing views on which ICT applications offered most potential
   for enhancing teaching and learning in their subject and differences in
   their preferred priorities for investment in ICT. The study also
   revealed that trainees felt that many of the experiences and resources
   which they had encountered in the course of their training had not been
   helpful.
   A follow up survey was undertaken of 114 trainees across six subject
   areas to further explore some of the findings from the initial survey.
   The concluding section of the paper suggests ways in which trainee
   teachers might be prepared more effectively for using ICT in their
   subject teaching. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the effects of visualization of participation
   during computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). It is
   hypothesized that visualization of participation could contribute to
   successful CSCL. A CSCL-environment was augmented with the
   Participation Tool (PT). The PT visualizes how much each group member
   contributes to his or her group's online communication. Using a
   posttest-only design with a treatment (N = 52) and a control group (N =
   17), it was examined whether students with access to the PT
   participated more and more equally during collaboration, reported
   higher awareness of group processes and activities, collaborated
   differently, and performed better than students without access to the
   PT. The results show that students used the PT quite intensively.
   Furthermore, compared to control group students, treatment group
   students participated more and engaged more in coordination and
   regulation of social activities during collaboration by sending more
   statements that addressed the planning of social activities. However,
   equality of participation, awareness of group processes and quality of
   the group products was not higher in the treatment condition. Still,
   the results of this study demonstrate that visualization of
   participation can contribute to successful CSCL. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The trend of using e-learning as a learning and/or teaching tool is now
   rapidly expanding into education. Although c-learning environments are
   popular, there is minimal research on instructors' and learners'
   attitudes toward these kinds of learning environments. The purpose of
   this study is to explore instructors' and learners' attitudes toward
   e-learning usage. Accordingly, 30 instructors and 168 college students
   are asked to answer two different questionnaires for investigating
   their perceptions. After statistical analysis, the results demonstrate
   that instructors have very positive perceptions toward using e-learning
   as a teaching assisted tool. Furthermore, behavioral intention to use
   e-learning is influenced by perceived usefulness and self-efficacy.
   Regarding to learners' attitudes, self-paced, teacher-led, and
   multimedia instruction are major factors to affect learners' attitudes
   toward e-learning as an effective learning tool. Based on the
   findings.. this research proposes guidelines for developing e-learning
   environments. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the rapid development of the information communication and
   technology (ICT) infrastructure in the Caribbean, there is an
   increasing demand for skilled software developers to meet the ICT needs
   of the region. Consequently, the web-based applications course offered
   at the University of the West Indies, has been redeveloped. One major
   part of its upgrading is the use of virtual worlds, such as the
   negotiate and deal environment (NADE) system, to bridge the disconnect
   that can occur between the technical/academic skills and the issues
   associated with developing software in a competitive business
   environment. NADE is a role-playing virtual environment for teaching
   the art of creating secure, Java, web-based systems for information
   processing and backend applications. The system provides an environment
   where group interactivity and strategic planning are key success
   factors. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Does lego training stimulate pupils' ability to solve logical problems?
SO COMPUTERS & EDUCATION

DT Article
DE robotic toys; problem solving; constructionism
AB The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a one-year
   regular robotic toys (lego) training on school pupils' performance. The
   underlying pedagogical perspective is the constructionist theory, where
   the main idea is that knowledge is constructed in the mind of the pupil
   by active learning.
   The investigation has been made in two steps. The first step was before
   the treatment and the second after treatment. For both cases we have
   constructed and included control groups. The data was gathered from
   different pupils from two different age categories, from different
   classes, from different schools, and finally from different places in
   Sweden. We have investigated whether the approach of involving the lego
   training in the schools activities might lead to improving the adoption
   process and that the pupils would perform better in mathematics and
   technique. Our null hypothesis states that the lego robots do not have
   a positive or negative effect on the pupils' ability to solve
   mathematical and logical problems. A one-way ANOVA test leads to
   acceptance of the null hypothesis. However, when ANOVA test was
   performed on sub groups of pupils, the null hypothesis was rejected in
   some cases. This indicates that lego training may be useful for some
   groups of students. Furthermore, a hypothesis test regarding certain
   correlation measures was conducted, supporting this theory. In general,
   the statistical analysis suggest that there is no obvious over-all
   effect of lego, though there are significant positive effects of lego
   for sub groups of pupils. In all, we find the results promising enough
   to suggest a larger experiment to be performed.
   The pupils have different learning styles in their approach to LEGO
   training. The role of the teacher, as a mediator of knowledge and
   skills, was crucial for coping with problems related to this kind of
   technology.
   The teacher must be able to support the pupils and to make them
   understand the LEGO Dacta material on a deeper level. (C) 2006 Elsevier

AB This article investigates the relation between home computer use and
   performance in English at school. The sample consists of 656
   tenth-class students (age 15-16) in upper-secondary schools in Bergen,
   Norway. Data collection took place in the spring of 2002 and was
   administrated by the county education office. After correcting for
   gender, subject interest, reading disabilities and different PC
   activity categories, it was still possible to predict performance in
   English on a significant level from the total time spent in front of
   the PC-screen. Both boys and girls who seldom used home computers
   achieved low scores in English. However, of those students who spent
   two or more hours per day in front of the screen, girls performed very
   well in English while boys failed to show similar performance gains.
   Moreover, youths who were classified as poor readers benefited more
   from using home computers than those who were more competent readers.

AB This paper presents a field study carried out with learners who used a
   grammar checker in real writing tasks in an advanced course at a
   Swedish university. The objective of the study was to investigate how
   students made use of the grammar checker in their writing while
   learning Swedish as a second language. Sixteen students with different
   linguistic and cultural backgrounds participated in the study. A
   judgment procedure was conducted by the learners on the alarms from the
   grammar checker. The students' texts were also collected in two
   versions; a version written before the session with the grammar
   checker, and a version after the session. This procedure made it
   possible to study to what extent the students followed the advice from
   the grammar checker, and how this was related to their judgments of its
   behavior. The results obtained demonstrated that although most of the
   alarms from the grammar checker were accurate, some alarms were very
   hard for the students to judge correctly.
   The results also showed that providing the student with feedback on
   different aspects of their target language use; not only on their
   errors, and facilitating the processes of language exploration and
   reflection are important processes to be supported in second-language
   learning environments.
   Based on these results, design principles were identified and
   integrated in the development of Grim, an interactive language-learning
   program for Swedish. We present the design of Grim, which is grounded
   in visualization of grammatical categories and examples of language
   use, providing tools for both focus on linguistic code features and
   language comprehension. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to determine whether the addition of
   interactivity to a computer-based learning package enhances the
   learning process. A sample of 33 (22 male and I I female)
   undergraduates on a Business and Management degree used a multimedia
   system to learn about the operation of a bicycle pump. The system
   consisted of a labelled diagram of the pump, followed by a description
   of twelve stages in its operation. The sample was randomly divided into
   two groups who used either an interactive (1) or a non-interactive (NI)
   version involving both images and text. The I system differed from the
   NI system by the incorporation of control of pace, self-assessment
   questions and an interactive simulation. Students then undertook two
   different types of tests to assess their learning: one designed to
   evaluate their memory by recalling facts from the lesson, and another
   designed to assess their understanding through solving novel diagnostic
   problems. Students using the I system outperformed those using the NI
   system in the problem-solving test, and needed less time to complete
   both memory and problem-solving tests. This result is consistent with
   the hypothesis that interactive systems facilitate deep learning by
   actively engaging the learner in the learning process. This suggests
   that educational designers who seek to foster deep learning (as opposed
   to mere factual recall) should adopt the incorporation of interactivity
   as a design principle. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purposes of this study were to explore the effects and the validity
   of on-line peer assessment in high schools and to analyze effects of
   various types of peer feedback on students. The participating students,
   a total of 184 10th graders, developed their individual course projects
   by involving the on-line peer assessment learning activities in a
   computer course. The peer assessment activities consisted of three
   rounds, and each of the students acted as an author and a reviewer.
   Research data as evaluated from peers and experts indicated that
   students significantly improved their projects as involving the peer
   assessment activities. The scores determined by the learning peers were
   highly correlated with those marked by the experts, indicating that
   peer assessment in high school could be perceived as a valid assessment
   method. Moreover, this study also examined the relationships between
   the types of peer feedbacks in which students obtained from peer
   assessment and the subsequent performance of their projects. We
   categorized peer feedbacks into four types: Reinforcing, Didactic,
   Corrective and Suggestive. It was found that Reinforcing peer feedback
   was useful in helping students' development of better projects;
   however, Didactic feedback and perhaps Corrective feedback provided by
   peers might play an unfavorable role for subsequent improvement of
   students' projects. The Suggestive feedback may be helpful in the
   beginning of peer assessment activities; however, in the later parts of
   peer assessment, the effect of this type of feedback on learning might
   not be significant. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
