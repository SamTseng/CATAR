AB This paper analyses the varied socio-economic implications of ICT-based
   educational change. Drawing from a rich, 3-year long research project
   with 20 secondary schools throughout Europe, the social, human,
   professional, institutional, and economic costs for building the school
   of tomorrow in close alliance with ICT are discussed. The aim of this
   paper is to show the real costs involved in such a comprehensive model
   of educational change, which cannot be reduced to the cost of
   installing computers in classrooms. Rather, it must aim at capturing
   the varied long-term requirements necessary for educational change in
   conjunction with ICT. Great emphasis is placed on questions concerning
   the very sustainability of innovation and the necessity to adopt a
   long-term perspective that provides us with a realistic socio-cconomic
   evaluation. We argue that the real costs of educational change only
   become apparent when short-term improvements have been converted into
   sustainable changes that last beyond a project's life-time. Key aspects
   for lasting contributions are identified, among which "network
   building" and applying a "bottom-up strategy" for change are given
   particular importance. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Computerphobic adults including first-year university students have
   been reported to range from 25% to 50%. Although self-reported computer
   anxiety has reduced in the past decade, it continues to be a
   significant issue for many. This is especially true for students of
   today where the stakes are high when using computers for their course
   work. Anxiety becomes even more critical when students are taking
   online courses. Past research has shown that computer experience is a
   strong predictor of whether or not a user will suffer anxiety symptoms
   while using a computer. Moreover, a substantial amount of work has been
   done to study the effect of previous computer experience on anxiety and
   on ease of use of information technologies using the technology
   acceptance model. However, few, if any, have investigated the role of
   anxiety in mediating technology usage experience on perceived ease of
   use. In this study, technology usage is viewed from two perspectives,
   the computer and the internet. We study the influence of anxiety in
   mediating the impact of computer and internet experiences on perceived
   ease of use. Questionnaire data from 114 university students were
   analyzed. The context was the use of a quiz tool to practice multiple
   choice questions. Contrary to most related studies, results indicated
   that anxiety has no mediating role on the impact of computer experience
   and perceived ease of use. However, anxiety was shown to present some
   moderating influence on perceived ease of use. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Automatic test generating system in distributed computing context is
   one of the most important links in on-line evaluation system. Although
   the issue has been argued long since, there is not a perfect solution
   to it so far. This paper proposed an innovative approach to
   successfully addressing such issue by the seamless integration of
   genetic algorithm (GA) and multi-agent system. In the design phase, a
   test ontology was firstly defined for smoothing the communication among
   agents. For the implementation of GA, The fitness function and the
   structure of chromosome were identified on the basis of the analysis of
   constraint conditions associated with a test. To demonstrate the task
   execution flow and messages passing among agents, the activity diagram
   and sequence diagram were also shown on the AUML basis. In the phase of
   implementation, the JADE based agent behavior model was described in
   detail and the implementation platform was also demonstrated. The final
   simulation results validated the feasibility of the proposed approach.

AB Like any other product, service and Web-based application, the success
   of Web-based learning depends largely on learners' satisfaction and
   other factors that will eventually increase learners' intention to
   continue using it. This paper integrates the concept of subjective task
   value and fairness theory to construct a model for investigating the
   motivations behind learners' intention to continue using Web-based
   learning. The model theorizes that four components of subjective task
   value (i.e., attainment, utility, intrinsic, and cost) and three
   dimensions of fairness (i.e., distributive, procedural, and
   interactional) affect learners' satisfaction. We also argue that
   satisfaction and four distinct components of subjective task value
   influence learners' intention to continue using Web-based learning. The
   hypothesized model is validated empirically using data collected from
   202 learners of a Web-based learning program designed for continuing
   education. The results showed that attainment value, utility value,
   intrinsic value, distributive fairness, and interactional fairness
   exhibited significant positive effects on satisfaction. Utility value
   and satisfaction play significant roles in shaping learners' intention
   to continue using Web-based learning. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The following paper presents a computer-based learning strategy to
   assist in introducing and teaching water quality modelling to
   undergraduate civil engineering students. As part of the learning
   strategy, an interactive computer-based instructional (CBI) aid was
   specifically developed to assist students to set up, run and analyse
   the output from a commercially available water quality model (WQMAP)
   for a hypothetical raw sewage spill. The CBI aid comprised a Hypertext
   Markup Language (HTML) module with helpful text and still graphics, and
   links to on-screen recorded motion movie clips showing on-screen
   actions and voice narrations during the instructors absence. An
   anonymous class questionnaire to assess the students' perceptions of
   the developed approach found that most students felt they were able to
   complete the project with minimum supervision, and have acquired a
   basic understanding of water quality modelling as a result of the
   activity. Additionally, almost all of the students found the CBI aid
   helpful and easy to follow. (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study analyzes the relationship between class size and student
   online activity patterns in a series of 28 graduate level computer
   conferencing courses. Quantitative analyses of note production, average
   note size, note opening and note reading percentages found a
   significant positive correlation between class size and mean number of
   notes generated. Significant negative correlations were found between
   class size and average note size and between class size and percent of
   notes opened. Analyses of average reading speeds among large classes
   and small classes revealed that students in large classes were more
   likely to scan lengthy notes (i.e... notes that contain more than 350
   words). Possible explanations for these results are discussed. (C) 2006

SO COMPUTERS & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE elementary education; pedagogical issues; interactive learning

AB The paper reports a small-scale, long-term pilot project designed to
   foster strategic and reasoning abilities in young primary school pupils
   by engaging them in a number of computer games, mainly those usually
   called mind games (brainteasers, puzzlers, etc.). In this paper, the
   objectives, work methodology, experimental setting, and tools used in
   the project are outlined, together with an analysis of some findings.
   In particular, we perform a brief analysis of some of the cognitive
   processes involved in playing with the computer games considered; we
   then discuss software features that, in our experience, help children
   tackle different cognitive tasks. The quantitative data collected
   during the pilot allow us, also, to take account of children's
   performance according to a number of different parameters, such as
   their level of achievement, the game's degree of difficulty and the
   type of data handled. Moreover, we reflect on the general impact of the
   project on children's reasoning abilities. The extent and duration of
   the study mean that, whilst the findings are not generalizable, they do
   offer insights into mechanisms underpinning basic strategic and
   reasoning skills as well as the educational potentialities offered by
   some of the existing computer games; they also point to some areas for
   further research. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MULTIPLE REPRESENTATIONS
AB Research findings show the difficulties younger students have in
   working with graphs. Higher mental operations are necessary for a
   skilled interpretation of abstract representations. We suggest
   connecting a concrete representation of the modeled problem with the
   related graph. The idea is to illustrate essential mental operations
   externally. This is called supplantation. We provide this special kind
   of support in a multimedia learning environment using several
   computer-specific features. Based on an information-processing model we
   identify two different types of supplantation of mental operations on
   graphs: first, supplantation of how to relate a certain point of the
   graph to the underlying concrete object or situation. Second,
   supplantation of how a point of the graph and the underlying fact or
   situation co-vary. In an empirical study, combinations of these types
   were investigated. The results indicate that such a supplantation of
   mental operations on graphs can become a useful tool to support
   adequate understanding of graphs. However, supplantation should be
   adjusted to individual abilities. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Remote laboratories can provide distant learners with practical
   acquisitions which would otherwise remain precluded. Our proposal here
   is a remote laboratory on a behavioural test (open field test), with
   the aim of introducing learners to the observation and analysis of
   stereotyped behaviour in animals. A real-time video of a mouse in an
   experimental arena is streamed over the Internet from a server computer
   connected with the laboratory apparatus to a client computer managed by
   an instructor. Learners observe the video projected by the client
   computer and record on their PCs the positions of the mouse in the
   arena and the behavioural patterns produced. Input-output interactions
   with the test apparatus are made possible by a remote, concurrently
   operated digital interface. Learners' recordings can be individually
   and collectively analysed, to assess behavioural trends and effects
   induced by client-commanded experimental treatments; the quality and
   the improvements in accuracy of the learners' recordings can also be
   estimated. A first implementation of the remote laboratory, carried out
   on two groups of undergraduate students, gave positive indications on
   the feasibility and the efficiency of the project, and on its didactic
   efficacy. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Annotation can be a valuable exercise when trying to understand new
   information. The technique can be used to create a 'condensed' version
   of the original information for later review and to add additional
   information into the existing document. The growth in web-based
   learning materials and information sources has created requirement for
   systems that allow annotations to be attached to these new sources and,
   potentially, shared with other learners. This paper discusses
   annotation in an educational context and introduces some of the web
   annotation systems currently available. It also provides an overview of
   the development of a new system, eLAWS, by the authors, based upon the
   Web Service architecture. Finally. the paper provides suggestions for

AB Recent research studies have reported on how novices and experts differ
   in storing, organizing, and retrieving subject matter knowledge and on
   how they apply their knowledge to solve new problems. These findings
   have been integrated and implemented in a computer environment to help
   novices improve their problem solving skills. An outline of this
   implementation and the manner in which it is used in an undergraduate
   hydraulic engineering course are presented. Student feedback on the
   educational value of this approach as well as data to demonstrate the
   improvement in their problem-solving abilities are also included.
   Preliminary evidence supporting the validity of computerized assessment
   of problem-solving skills is also included. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB First year students at the University of the Witwatersrand in
   Johannesburg, South Africa, were surveyed about their perceptions of
   Computer Science before and towards the end of their first year
   courses. The aim of this research was to investigate how the students'
   attitudes changed during these courses and to assess the impact of the
   innovative breadth-first curriculum that has been developed in the
   School of Computer Science which emphasises the fundamentals of the
   discipline and the mathematical nature of Computer Science. The results
   show that most perceptions did not change much or that there were
   changes in both directions. More students, and particularly female
   students, were positive about their own understanding of the nature of
   Computer Science after the course than before. However, when asking
   specifically about jobs and course content, there was not a
   substantially deeper understanding at the end of the course of what
   content they would expect to encounter in a Computer Science course or
   working as a Computer Scientist. Fewer students, particularly male
   students, thought that Computer Science and mathematics were closely
   related after the course than before and this was an unexpected result,
   which may be the result of discrete mathematics topics being taught in
   courses separate from those in which continuous mathematics topics are
   taught. Students became less positive about working with computers
   after the course, a result which supports prior research, but is an
   issue for concern as computers will play some role in their future
   careers. The students found the courses challenging and different from
   their expectations with few students finding the courses unenjoyable.

ID AWARENESS; SITUATION
AB An integrated learning object, a web-based inquiry environment "Young
   Scientist" for basic school level is introduced by applying the
   semiosphere conception for explaining learning processes. The study
   focused on the development of students' (n = 30) awareness of the
   affordances of learning objects (LO) during the 3 inquiry tasks, and
   their ability of dynamically reconstructing meanings in the inquiry
   subtasks through exploiting these LO affordances in "Young Scientist".
   The problem-solving data recorded by the inquiry system and the
   awareness questionnaire served as the data-collection methods.
   It was demonstrated that learners obtain complete awareness of the LO
   affordances in an integrated learning environment only after several
   problem-solving tasks. It was assumed that the perceived task-related
   properties and functions of LOs depend on students' interrelations with
   LOs in specific learning contexts. Learners' overall awareness of
   certain LO affordances, available in the inquiry system "Young
   Scientist", developed with three kinds of patterns, describing the
   hierarchical development of the semiosphere model for learners. The
   better understanding of the LO affordances, characteristic to the
   formation of the functioning semiosphere, was significantly related to
   the advanced knowledge construction during these inquiry subtasks that
   presumed translation of information from one semiotic system to
   another. The implications of the research are discussed in the frames
   of the development of new contextual gateways for learning with virtual
   objects. It is assumed that effective LO-based learning has to be
   organized through pedagogically constrained gateways by manifesting
   certain LO affordances in the context in order to build up the dynamic
   semiosphere model for learners. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The introduction of computer technology has touched off an actual
   revolution for teaching and learning activities. In the present study,
   we investigated the impact of the implementation and use of computers
   in the public school system, from the elementary grades to high school,
   in Niteroi city, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). This city, with a total
   population of approximately 500,000, was chosen for this study based on
   the claim it offers the best educational project in Brazil, and on the
   fact that it is ranked as the first city in terms of digital inclusion
   in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and the second one in all Brazil,
   according to IBGE - Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography
   (Census 2000). This is a rather significant standings and represents an
   important qualitative and quantitative feature in comparison to other
   Brazilian municipalities and even to the experience in other countries.
   In our survey, we found that 82% of the municipal elementary schools
   (from the 1st to 4th grades, equivalent to the elementary school system
   in the US, and to the first phase of secondary education in France, and
   32% of the state schools, including secondary school (high school
   system in the US, and the 2nd phase of secondary education in France)
   have computer laboratories. Difficulties were observed, such as the
   adequacy of teachers' training and continuing education, computer
   laboratory schedule, number of computers available, and equipment
   maintenance.
   In this context, this work is useful for the establishment of policies
   of implementation and use of this technology in Brazil, since as yet
   there is no established world policy, despite UNESCO initiatives. (C)

AB This paper reports on a longitudinal study of developments in use of
   the Internet by science student-teachers on Post Graduate Certificate
   of Education (PGCE) courses in five higher education institution-school
   partnerships in England. These are 1-year, full-time, teacher training
   courses for graduate scientists. The aim of the research was to examine
   changes in attitudes to, and use of, the Internet to support science
   teaching and the perceived challenges and barriers to practice in
   schools, against a background of high national expectations reflected
   in the qualification standards of the teacher education courses. The
   research has involved nearly 600 student-teachers, representing between
   7% and 8% of those training on PGCE science courses in England, and has
   employed mixed methods, with questionnaires serving as the main basis
   for analysing trends, and focus groups and case studies used to gain
   deeper insight to the particular issues identified. The process has
   been an iterative one, with the outcomes of each year's research being
   used to inform further research and course developments in the
   institutions involved. The findings indicate that attitudes and
   confidence in use of the Internet have improved over the period, with
   evidence of increased application directly in the classroom. However,
   in addition to some of the generic technological issues that may hinder
   developments in the use of Information and Communication Technology in
   schools, there are continuing concerns relating to limited pedagogical
   guidance and availability of good role models. The implications of this
   for developments in science teacher education programmes are discussed.

TI Investigating the relationship between subject content knowledge and
   pedagogical practice through the analysis of classroom discourse
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English

ID SCIENCE TEACHERS; MATTER KNOWLEDGE; ANALOGIES; BIOLOGY; INSTRUCTION;
   PHYSICS; SCHOOL
AB A previous study highlighted the perception among secondary science
   teachers that they faced considerable challenges to their pedagogical
   practice when teaching unfamiliar areas of the curriculum; for example,
   when teaching out of subject specialism. One of the major challenges
   cited by the teachers was being able to give appropriate and effective
   science teaching explanations in the classroom. Since talking in order
   to explain science is at the centre of what science teachers do, this
   concern is a significant one for teacher educators. This article
   considers some of the methodological issues about how to investigate
   the relationship between teachers' subject content knowledge and their
   pedagogical practice. The research outlined focuses on a single science
   teacher's practice in giving science teaching explanations when
   teaching in and out of subject specialism. Although the findings from a
   single case are of limited value in terms of generalisability, this
   study adds to the discussion about future research into the
   relationship between teachers' professional knowledge bases and their
   pedagogical practices.

TI Gender effects in children's development and education
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL MODELS; CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; ELEMENTARY ASTRONOMY; EARTH;
   COSMOLOGIES; KNOWLEDGE; CHILDHOOD; ROTATION; PHYSICS; CYCLE
AB This paper attempts to clarify several lines of research on gender in
   development and education, inter-relating findings from studies on
   intuitive/informal knowledge with those from research on achievements
   and attitudes in science. It acknowledges the declining proportions of
   male teachers world-wide and examination successes which indicate a
   reversal of educational disadvantage from female to male; as well as
   the recent evidence on the effects of the gender of teachers upon
   student success. An empirical contribution to the literature is
   offered, drawing from the gender-related findings from research on
   children's cosmologies in China and New Zealand with 346 boys and 340
   girls (of whom 119 boys and 121 girls participated in the current
   study). The investigation focused on children's concepts of the motion
   and shape of the Earth through observational astronomy and gave
   children opportunities to express their ideas in several modalities.
   The in-depth interviews allowed children to share their meanings with
   gender differences becoming apparent (e. g. girls' superior ability to
   visually represent their cosmologies and boys' greater awareness of
   gravity). However, these differences were not universal across genders
   or cultures and marked similarities were apparent both in the content
   of children's responses and in their reasoning processes. By comparing
   boy/girl cosmological concept categories and by tracking their
   developmental trends by age, statistical evidence revealed the extent
   of the similarities within and across these diverse cultures. The
   findings reinforce those from the authors' knowledge restructuring and
   cultural mediation studies and provide support for the view that boys
   and girls have similar, holistic-rather-than-fragmented, cosmologies
   which have features in common across cultures and ethnic groups.

TI Students' understanding of conservation of matter, stoichiometry and
   balancing equations in Indonesia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY; TEACHERS CONCEPTIONS; LEVEL
AB This study examines Indonesian students' understanding of conservation
   of matter, balancing of equations and stoichiometry. Eight hundred and
   sixty-seven Grade 12 students from 22 schools across four different
   cities in two developed provinces in Indonesia participated in the
   study. Nineteen teachers also participated in order to validate the
   25-question survey used with all students. Significant differences in
   student success in answering specific questions occurred when comparing
   high-achievement and low-achievement schools. However, in general,
   student understanding of this fundamental principle in chemistry was
   low. The study found that the average score for all students on the
   survey was 41%. The findings suggest that students are most successful
   in solving problems used by teachers and textbooks that are
   algorithmic-based (i. e., stoichiometry). As there were no strong
   positive correlations between student performance on conceptual
   questions and algorithmic questions, we suggest that further research
   should focus on teaching practices and curricula that support the
   development of the students' conceptual understanding.

TI Curricula and the use of ICT in education: Two worlds apart?
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID TEACHERS; SCHOOLS; PERSPECTIVES; COMPUTERS
AB In many countries, information and communication technology (ICT) has a
   clear impact on the development of educational curricula. In Flanders,
   the education government has identified and defined a framework of ICT
   competencies for expected outcomes, related to knowledge, skills and
   attitudes that pupils are expected to achieve at the end of primary
   school. However, it has never been examined whether teachers are using
   ICT in accordance with the competencies proposed by the Flemish
   government. In order to answer this question, a survey was conducted
   among 570 respondents in a stratified sample of 53 primary schools.
   Results show that teachers mainly focus on the development of technical
   ICT skills, whereas the ICT curriculum centres on the integrated use of
   ICT within the learning and teaching process. This indicates the
   existence of a gap between the proposed and the implemented curriculum
   for ICT. The paper concludes with the potential value of a school-based
   ICT curriculum that 'translates' the national ICT-related curriculum
   into an ICT plan as part of the overall school policy.

   the e-rater program. There was a good agreement between human and
   machine marking. Scripts with highly discrepant scores were flagged and
   assessed blind by expert markers for characteristics considered likely
   to produce human-machine discrepancies. As hypothesised, essays marked
   higher by humans exhibited more abstract qualities such as interest and
   relevance, while there was little, if any, difference on more
   mechanical factors such as paragraph demarcation.

AB Although researchers have developed various scales for measuring users'
   computer anxiety or Internet anxiety, none of the literature has
   addressed the measurement of mobile computer anxiety (MCA). The purpose
   of this study is to develop and validate a multidimensional mobile
   computer anxiety scale (MCAS) based on previous research on computer
   anxiety and Internet anxiety. In this study, I introduce and define the
   construct of MCA, provide an empirical validation of the construct and
   its underlying dimensionality, develop a generic MCA scale with
   desirable psychometric properties and explore the scale's theoretical
   and practical applications. By analysing data from a sample of 287
   respondents, this study proposes a 7-factor, 38-item MCAS. This
   empirically validated scale will be useful to researchers in developing
   and testing mobile learning (m-learning) theories, as well as to
   educators and m-learning managers in understanding an individual's MCA
   and in promoting the use of mobile computing and learning systems.

ID EMOTION; PERFORMANCE
AB The purpose of this study was to examine whether a video-induced
   positive and negative mood has a differential effect on subsequent
   problem-solving activities in a web-based environment. The study also
   examined whether task conditions (task demands) moderated the mood
   effect. As in traditional experimental mood-effect studies, the
   affective video materials were not related to the tasks. The results
   show that affective video clips did impact performance on an insight
   task but not on a divergent-thinking task. This provides evidence that
   in some cases affective video has an effect on the performance of
   unrelated tasks in a web-based environment.

AB Currently, for educators and researchers, diagnosing the online
   interactions specifically related to knowledge and expertise exchanges
   is challenging. To address the problem, this paper describes a
   framework for the understanding and measurement of expertise presence
   in computer conferences. Expertise presence is defined as a persistent
   contribution of knowledge relevant to the purposes of the computer
   conferences. The paper includes a technique for measuring the strength
   of expertise presence from transcripts of computer conferences, and it
   also envisages a number of applications in online learning diagnosis
   and research. A case study of the application of the framework to the
   computer conferences of several online courses is discussed.

   participation in a CSCL environment
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
ID COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION; GENDER; EDUCATION
AB Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) is often presented as
   a promising learning method. However, it is also facing some new
   challenges. Apart from answering the question of whether or not working
   with CSCL generates satisfying learning outcomes, it is important to
   determine whether or not all participants profit from collaboration,
   with the computer as a means of communication. This paper describes the
   implementation and effects of an experimental program in 5 classes with
   a total of 120 students in elementary education who, in groups of four,
   engaged in Knowledge Forum discussion tasks on the subject of healthy
   eating. The study explores whether or not differences occur in the
   participation of students who differ in gender, sociocultural
   background and ability, and whether or not computer skills, computer
   attitudes, comprehensive reading scores and popularity with classmates
   are related to student participation. Students' participation in this
   CSCL environment appears to be dependent on a number of learner
   characteristics. Girls contribute more words to the discussions than
   boys do and are more dependent on their computer skills in this
   production. Students who are good at comprehensive reading also
   contribute more words. Popularity among classmates appears to influence
   the degree of participation further. We also found indications that
   students with immigrant parents write fewer contributions than those
   whose parents are not immigrants.

AB The paper addresses how the construct of zone of proximal development
   was used as an analytical lens to examine teachers' integration of
   computer technology for teaching. The research question 'What are the
   teachers' psychological insights that serve to mediate student
   learning?' was the focus of the study. Six secondary school science
   teachers took part in the 5-month study. Data were collected using
   qualitative methods. Analysis of participants' natural metaphoric
   language revealed four themes that framed participants' psychological
   insights: mediation as a journey; mediation as adopting roles;
   mediation as mutual investment; and, mediation as liberating and/or
   domesticating. Collectively, these psychological insights mediated
   learning actions within the zone of proximal development.

TI Using a two-tier test to assess students' understanding and alternative
   conceptions of cyber copyright laws
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PERCEPTIONS; SCIENCE
AB The purpose of this study is to explore students' understanding of
   cyber copyright laws. This study developed a two-tier test with 10
   two-level multiple-choice questions. The first tier presented a
   real-case scenario and asked whether the conduct was acceptable whereas
   the second-tier provided reasons to justify the conduct. Students in
   Taiwan (123 college students and 121 high school students) were
   selected to answer these questions. The results indicated that 66.16%
   correctly answered the first-tier questions, but only 36.84% students
   correctly chose the second-tier reasons. The researchers found that
   college students had significantly higher scores on both tiers than did
   high school students, but gender made no difference between the two
   groups. Three alternative conceptions that students have regarding
   cyber copyright laws were concluded from this study: (1) the Internet
   content is entirely open for the public to use; (2) the Internet is
   always free; and (3) all educational use is fair use. Implications of
   these results for college and high school courses and future research
   directions are discussed.

TI A comparison of student feedback obtained through paper-based and
   web-based surveys of faculty teaching
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Many colleges have either begun or are contemplating using the
   web-based survey to gather student feedback on faculty teaching. Unlike
   the paper-based method, the web-based approach gives every student in
   the class the opportunity to provide feedback. Hence, the populations
   that participate in the web-based and paper-based methods may be quite
   different, and so may be the feedback. This paper compares the results
   of student feedback gathered through paper-based and web-based
   approaches. The results provide information to faculty and
   administrators on any differences they may expect as they make the
   transition from a paper-based to a web-based survey of faculty teaching.

TI The quest for deeper learning: An investigation into the impact of a
   knowledge-pooling WebQuest in primary initial teacher training
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper explores the impact on learning in higher education of the
   integration of a knowledge-pooling stage into a WebQuest. We explain
   the concept of WebQuests, consider recent literature regarding the
   effects and difficulties of this approach to learning, and examine
   students' perceptions of the impact of this tool on high-order
   learning. The level of learning achieved by respondents is analysed
   using Biggs' Structure of the Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO)
   taxonomy. With judicious use of a 'pooling knowledge stage', and
   provided that students are fully aware of the desired learning
   outcomes, the findings suggest that WebQuests do have the potential to
   promote high-order learning. The paper concludes by suggesting the need
   for further research into the potential of WebQuests to promote
   high-order learning within different disciplines in higher education.

TI Conversations about science across activities in Mexican-descent
   families
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID MATERNAL TEACHING STRATEGIES; THINKING; CHICANO
AB Parent-child "everyday" conversations have been suggested as a source
   of children's early science learning. If such conversations are
   important, then it would be pertinent to know whether children from
   different family backgrounds have different experiences talking about
   science in informal settings. We focus on the relation between parents'
   schooling and both their explanatory talk in science-related activities
   and the styles of interaction they use with their children. Families
   from different schooling backgrounds within one under-represented group
   in science education-Mexican-descent families-were included in this
   study. Forty families were observed in two science-related activities.
   In the sink-or-float task, families were asked to predict which of a
   variety of objects would sink and which would float, and then to test
   their predictions in a tub of water. The second activity was an
   open-ended visit to a local children's museum. Results showed similar
   patterns in scientific talk on the sink-or-float task across the two
   groups. However, the interaction style varied with schooling across the
   two activities; parents with higher schooling were more directive than
   parents with basic schooling. Interaction style was also found to vary
   with task structure, with more open-ended tasks affording more
   collaborative interactions. Such research into parent-child
   conversations in science-related activities can help begin to guide us
   in bridging children's learning environments-home, school, and
   museum-and potentially fostering children's science learning,
   particularly in those groups under-represented in the sciences.

   ARGUMENTATION; PARTICIPATION; DEMOCRACY; MUSEUM; KNOWLEDGE; FUTURE;
   ISSUE
AB In the past five years, informal science institutions (ISIs), science
   communication, advocacy and citizen action groups, funding
   organizations, and policy-makers in the UK and the USA have become
   increasingly involved in efforts to promote increased public engagement
   with science and technology (PEST). Such engagement is described as
   taking place within the context of a "new mood for dialogue" between
   scientific and technical experts and the public. Mechanisms to increase
   PEST have taken a number of forms. One of the most visible features of
   this shift towards PEST in ISIs is the organization and staging of
   adult-focused, face-to-face forums that bring scientific and technical
   experts, social scientists, and policy-makers into discussion with
   members of the public about contemporary scientific and socioscientific
   issues related to the development and application of science and
   technology. A significant aspect of the literature on efforts to
   increase PEST has focused on the development of a unifying evaluative
   framework for determining what counts as success for PEST mechanisms,
   and how success (or lack thereof) can be empirically measured. In this
   article, we draw from our experiences as UK-based and US-based
   "dialogue event" practitioners and researchers/evaluators to suggest
   that these existing evaluative criteria are insufficient to explore the
   role and value of ISI-based "dialogue events." Instead, we suggest that
   it may be productive to research and evaluate these ISI-based "dialogue
   events" as sites of learning. Secondly, however, we show through a
   discussion of our own research frameworks that understanding these
   "dialogue events" as sites of learning does not intuitively provide a
   framework for understanding what counts as success for these efforts.
   Instead, research on the role of "dialogue" within the educational
   literature- and the connections between "dialogue" and competing
   understandings of the nature of science and society-offers a
   multiplicity of approaches to defining the terms and goals of these
   events. Finally, we identify two broader implications of researching
   and evaluating these "dialogue events" as sites of learning for ISIs
   and all efforts to increase PEST.

TI School site to museum floor: How informal science institutions work
   with schools
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID TEACHERS; KNOWLEDGE
AB Two research studies sponsored by the Centre for Informal Learning and
   Schools (CILS) investigated the programmes informal science
   institutions (ISIs) currently provide to support K-12 science
   education, particularly in the area of teacher professional development
   (PD). The first study was a large-scale survey with 475 ISIs responding
   about the programmes they offer schools and teachers beyond one-day
   field trips. A large majority of ISIs (73%) reported having one or more
   of these programmes, with more than one-half (59%) providing one or
   more forms of teacher PD. ISIs also reported a tendency for their
   programmes to be under-subscribed, and said funding was the biggest
   barrier to their ability to provide these programmes. A second study
   focused on ISI-based teacher PD programmes, looking at whom they serve,
   how they are funded, and their specific programmatic elements. This
   study also investigated the extent to which ISI-based PD incorporates
   features shown to produce measurable effects on teachers' instructional
   practice. Researchers administered an intensive survey to over 310 ISIs
   with teacher PD offerings to obtain detail regarding the programming.
   The findings reported here indicate that the particular promise of
   ISI-based teacher PD is the potential to incorporate features of PD
   that have been shown by research to produce measurable effects on
   teachers' practice. The results from these two studies suggest that
   while some opportunities may be missed to leverage the strengths of the
   ISIs' learning environment in K-12 science education, ISIs continue to
   support K-12 science education in the United States in important and
   varied ways.

TI Conceptualizing learning from the everyday activities of digital kids
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CHILDREN; DESIGN; TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper illustrates the intensified engagement that youth are having
   with digital technologies and introduces a framework for examining
   digital fluency-the competencies, new representational practises,
   design sensibilities, ownership, and strategic expertise that a learner
   gains or demonstrates by using digital tools to gather, design,
   evaluate, critique, synthesize, and develop digital media artefacts,
   communication messages, or other electronic expressions. A primary goal
   of this paper is to identify promising perspectives through which
   learning is conceptualized, and to share the methodological challenges
   in investigating digital fluency in both individual and collaborative
   learning activities that take place in complex naturalistic settings
   and socially constructed online worlds. A review is provided of the
   current and prospective research methods that researchers use to
   capture, document, and study the compelling ways in which children and
   young people are using digital technologies such as Information and
   Communication Technologies, social networking software, video games,
   multimedia authoring tools, and mobile phones in everyday life to learn
   and play. The paper argues for a need to study the authentic,
   inventive, and emergent uses of digital technologies and interactive
   learning environments among youth to contribute to advancement of
   theories of everyday learning and to build a deeper understanding of
   how learning occurs in out-of-school settings from a practise-oriented
   perspective rather than a knowledge-centred one. Implications for
   instructional practise are also discussed in addition to ethical and
   pragmatic issues that will need to be addressed in the study of digital
   kids.

TI Exhibiting performance: Co-participation in science centres and museums
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CONVERSATIONS; FAMILY; COLLABORATION; SETTINGS
AB There is a growing commitment within science centres and museums to
   deploy computer-based exhibits to enhance participation and engage
   visitors with socio-scientific issues. As yet, however, we have little
   understanding of the interaction and communication that arises with and
   around these forms of exhibits, and the extent to which they do indeed
   facilitate engagement. In this paper, we examine the use of novel
   computer-based exhibits to explore how people, both alone and with
   others, interact with and around the installations. The data are drawn
   from video-based field studies of the conduct and communication of
   visitors to the Energy Gallery at London's Science Museum. The paper
   explores how visitors transform their activity with and around
   computer-based exhibits into performances, and how such performances
   create shared experiences. It reveals how these performances can
   attract other people to become an audience to an individual's use of
   the system and subsequently sustain their engagement with both the
   performance and the exhibit. The observations and findings of the study
   are used to reflect upon the extent to which the design of exhibits
   enables particular forms of co-participation or shared experiences, and
   to develop design sensitivities that exhibition managers and designers
   may consider when wishing to engender novel ways of engagement and
   participation with and around computer-based exhibits.

TI Use of questions in exhibit labels to generate explanatory conversation
   among science museum visitors
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Research suggests that conversations at museums contribute to, as well
   as serve as evidence for, learning. Many museums use labels to provide
   visitors with information as well as stimulate conversation about
   exhibit topics. However, most studies on exhibit labels do not centre
   on conversations. This investigation uses a Vygotskian framework to
   examine the ways questions in exhibit labels can stimulate
   conversations in a science museum. We examined the questions and
   explanations that appeared in conversation occurring under three label
   conditions (Current Label, Added question "Why is this here?", and
   Simplified Text plus Question) at three exhibits in a science museum.
   Each exhibit (a model of a Victorian workshop, a sectioned 1959 Austin
   Mini Cooper, and a bowl that survived the atomic bomb in Hiroshima,
   Japan) was videotaped for approximately 6 hr in each condition.
   Findings based on 464 conversations at these exhibits indicated that
   our guiding question affected visitors' conversations; however, adding
   the question had different effects at different exhibits. For example,
   at the Mini-Cooper exhibit, people asked more open-ended questions with
   the question added than in the current label condition. At this exhibit
   there were also more open-ended questions used in conjunction with
   explanatory responses when the question was present. In contrast, the
   guiding question at the Hiroshima bowl exhibit had no effect. These
   results imply that it is important to consider the nature of the
   exhibit when designing labels that will optimally facilitate learning
   conversations.

TI Talk, tools, and tensions: Observing biological talk over time
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SENSE-MAKING; SCIENCE; DISCOURSE; LITERACY; DIALOGUE; LANGUAGE
AB The goal of this study is to explore new tools for analyzing scientific
   sense-making in out-of-school settings. Although such measures are now
   common in science classroom research, dialogically based methodological
   approaches are relatively new to informal learning research. Such
   out-of-classroom settings have more recently become a breeding ground
   for new design approaches for tracking scientific talk and ideas within
   complex data-sets. The research reported here seeks to understand the
   language people do use to make sense of the life sciences over time.
   Another goal of this study is to track biological themes over time,
   using a new analytical scheme - the Tool for Observing Biological Talk
   Over Time. Our analyses are linked to and informed by tensions between
   particularistic and holistic data collection and analysis, qualitative
   and quantitative representations, and everyday and formal science
   discourse. These tensions and our analyses are linked to larger
   theoretical frameworks and to the recursive interplay between theory
   and practice.

TI Using texting to support students' transition to university
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
ID HIGHER-EDUCATION; MOTIVATION
AB This article argues that judicious use of mobile phone text messaging
   by university staff has the potential to enhance the support provided
   to students by an academic department during the transition to
   university. It reports on an evaluation of a desktop computer
   application, Student Messenger, which enables staff to send text
   messages from their computers to the mobile phones of groups of
   students. Analysis of qualitative interviews with 30 students reveals
   that text messaging is the dominant mode of electronic communication
   amongst students and plays a central role in maintaining their social
   networks. The text message dialogue amongst students provides emotional
   and social peer support and facilitates an informal system of
   interdependent learning in relation to navigating unfamiliar academic
   and administrative systems. Text messages from university staff,
   inserted into this dialogue, can enhance the existing peer support and
   aid students' social integration into university life.

DT Article
AB This paper introduces various visual models for the analysis and
   description of learning processes. The models analyse learning on two
   levels: the dynamic level ( as a process over time) and the functional
   level. Two types of model for dynamic modelling are proposed: the
   session trace, which documents a specific learner in a particular
   learning session; and the state diagram, which depicts the various
   stages which learners may encounter when they attempt to learn a new
   concept or solve a problem. A functional model is used to depict the
   flow of knowledge between various participants and objects in the
   learning process. The visual model adopted for functional modelling is
   based on the use of data- flow diagrams. A methodology for the

AB This paper describes the development of a business simulation combining
   a computer application with real experts to provide university students
   with an immersive experience in business management. It introduces a
   methodology that involves students in a process of interaction with
   other participants as well as benefiting from valuable feedback from
   experts acting as economic agents. The approach has been tested, in the
   context of a Certificate of European Law and Economics course, at the
   University of Economics in Bratislava, Slovakia during the 2002/ 3 and
   2003/ 4 academic years. Analysis of the experience that was gained has
   provided some guidelines that instructors can use to integrate
   simulation effectively into their teaching practices relating to
   strategic management.

AB This paper provides an insider account of a cohort- based doctoral
   programme. It shows how undertaking doctoral study exposes candidates
   to confronting unfamiliar levels of conceptualization. The conceptual
   framework, a regularly occurring difficulty for many candidates, became
   the specific focus for tutorial discussions and informal attention
   within communities of practice. These two devices appear to have
   assisted candidates in developing appreciative positions towards
   acquiring, or improving, their conceptual grasp through higher
   cognitive processes that emerge from the act of interaction. Thus,
   cohort- based communities of practice offer doctoral programmes ways
   that assist candidates to improve their conceptual capabilities.

TI Postgraduate research success: communities of practice involving
   cohorts, guardian supervisors and online communities
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Traditionally, supervisors work with students on an individual basis
   and postgraduate development programmes are run on site. However, with
   increasing numbers of part- time and international students,
   supervisory relationships are likely to be conducted at a distance as
   students study alongside other commitments. Isolation can often be a
   key feature for many postgraduates, whether based in the same
   institution as the supervisor and more particularly for international
   students or those studying at a distance. It can also be an issue for
   their supervisors. However, in this age of electronic communication,
   interactions at a distance should be able to be at least as robust as
   many of those conducted face to face. More broadly, the international
   research community is something generally cited as the context for
   research work, supervision, study and publication more generally. Entry
   firstly into the university academic community, and then into the
   larger global research community can be enabled, we would argue, by the
   support of communities of practice from the outset of postgraduate
   students' and supervisors' interactions. In this context, considerable
   numbers of international postgraduates at Anglia Ruskin University (
   UK) and their supervisors are being effectively supported through three
   innovations which build institutionally related communities of
   practice: ( 1) Guardian supervisors work with the students on research
   development programmes, with accompanying meetings organised during and
   round programme workshops, which focus throughout on strategies of
   meta- learning. Subsequently they support students' work at a distance
   with emails, and webcam correspondence. ( 2) PhD students are empowered
   to develop mutual, critically focused support for each other's work
   through the enhanced use of the cohort in the compulsory research
   development workshops and through ongoing discussion lists, self- help
   groups and symposia. ( 3) Supervisors of international postgraduates
   are supported as a community of practice through the revision of online
   supervisory discussion and development. This paper is based on action
   research carried out with current and graduate students, guardian
   supervisors and supervisors as collaborators to explore the rationale,
   problems, practices and the richness of the experience of working with
   a system which fosters communities of practice, involving guardian
   supervisors, distance supervisors and postgraduate cohorts.

AB Teaching staff, designing conventional courses in higher education,
   must make decisions about selecting content and activities to engage
   students in learning. When the Internet is chosen as the principal
   delivery vehicle it presents particular challenges for the design of
   active learning. Further challenges are added when working with a
   complex, multidisciplinary subject, with no unique solutions for the
   learner. This paper examines strategies employed in designing case
   study material to encourage active learning in sustainable development.
   Significant elements for successful practice are identified in the
   application of key learning design principles to meet the challenge of
   Web design for active and constructive learning. Principles of variety,
   action, application, interaction, feedback, scaffolding and evaluation
   are offered as a framework and set of benchmarks for teaching staff and
   learning technologists designing and evaluating Web- based learning
   initiatives.

AB Within the already limited literature on instructional practices in
   detracked classrooms, there are even fewer research-based studies of
   detracked science classrooms. This article attempts to address this gap
   in the research literature, delving into the unique challenges and
   instructional responses to teaching detracked science. The authors
   report on a case study of two chemistry teachers' heterogeneous
   classrooms at a racially diverse, public high school in California,
   where all students have been required to take chemistry since the
   school's founding in 1994. The authors highlight the following four
   beliefs and instructional practices that were instrumental in teachers'
   successful efforts to teach detracked chemistry classes: (1) teachers'
   true belief in a developmental conception of ability and intelligence;
   (2) a focus on an inquiry-based pedagogical approach to chemistry
   foregrounding real-world contexts; (3) a focus on teaching students
   study skills; and (4) a strong sense of community in the classroom,
   where students are held responsible for their own and each other's
   learning. To illustrate each of these findings, the authors select
   vivid examples from fieldnotes of classroom observations as well as
   interviews of teachers and students that make clear how teachers
   enacted and students experienced these elements in chemistry
   classrooms. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Thirty fourth-grade students participated in an extended intervention
   previously successful in fostering skills of scientific investigation
   and inference, notably control of variables (COV). The intervention was
   similarly successful for a majority of students in the present study,
   enabling them to isolate the three causal and two noncausal variables
   operating in a multivariable system. However, when asked to predict
   outcomes of various constellations of variable levels, they tended not
   to take into account the effects of all of the causal variables they
   had identified. Moreover, they did not adhere to a consistency
   principle, i.e., that a factor that produces an effect can be expected
   to produce the same effect in the future, given similar conditions.
   These findings suggest that COV is not the only challenge students
   experience in reasoning about multiple variables. Elementary-school
   students' mental models of multivariable causality appear to deviate
   from a normative, scientific model, even after they have mastered that
   aspect of scientific method having to do with the design of controlled
   experiments to isolate effects of individual variables. The challenges,
   beyond COV, that appear to be involved in making prediction judgments
   involving multiple variables warrant attention in the design of
   curricula to foster development of scientific thinking skills. (c) 2007

AB Engagement has been viewed as an important construct to understand
   students' learning performances in classroom settings. Taking an
   interactive perspective, the study investigates ninth graders'
   cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement in teacher-centered
   (TC) and student-centered (SC) technology-enhanced classrooms. 54
   students from two science classes in Taiwan participated in this study.
   Multiple sources of data were collected during a 3-week instructional
   unit. The statistical results showed that although students in the SC
   class reported having significantly higher emotional engagement, the
   emotional engagement level had no impact on students' learning
   achievement. Analyses of qualitative data showed that students in both
   classes spent a majority of class time on cognitive involvement in
   learning activities, but there were qualitative differences in
   cognitive and behavioral engagement between the two classes. One type
   of activities that did not occur in the TC class was making reflections
   in which students in the SC class self-assessed what they did. In
   addition, the SC class usually interacted through group discussions
   provoked by the simulations, whereas the TC class frequently interacted
   through initiation-response-evaluation sequences and engaged in
   student-initiated discussions. The findings suggest that both
   instructional approaches promoted students' conceptual understanding
   and provided students with different opportunities to engage in science
   learning. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study describes an example of design-based research in which we
   make theoretical improvements in our understanding, in part based on
   empirical work, and use these to revise our curriculum and,
   simultaneously, our evolving theory of the relations between contexts
   and disciplinary formalisms. Prior to this study, we completed a first
   cycle of design revisions to a game-based ecological sciences
   curriculum to make more apparent specific domain concepts associated
   with targeted learning standards. Of particular interest was using
   gaming principles to embed standards-based science concepts in the
   curricular experience without undermining the situative embodiment
   central to our design philosophy. In Study One reported here, the same
   first-cycle elementary teacher used the refined second-cycle
   curriculum, again with high-ability fourth graders. We then analyzed
   qualitative and quantitative data on student participation and
   performance to further refine our theory and revise the curriculum. In
   Study Two, another teacher implemented a further refined second-cycle
   curriculum with lower achieving fourth graders, including several
   students labeled as having special needs. We use the design trajectory
   and results to illustrate and warrant the creation of a situationally
   embodied curriculum that supports the learning of specific disciplinary
   formalisms. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Informed by literature on childhood expertise in high-interest topics
   and parent-child conversation in museum settings, this study explored
   how children's level of dinosaur expertise influences family learning
   opportunities in a natural history museum. Interviews identified
   children with high and low dinosaur knowledge and assigned them to
   expert and novice groups. Parent surveys revealed that expert children
   were more likely to have home environments where family members shared
   interests in dinosaurs and provided a variety of dinosaur learning
   resources. Analysis of family conversations demonstrated that parents
   with novice children more actively engaged them in learning
   conversations than parents with expert children. The implications of
   this shift in parental engagement are considered in terms of interest
   and knowledge development in informal settings, highlighting how
   islands of expertise might facilitate and in some cases hinder learning
   through shared family activity. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID PIPELINE
AB This study examined how 16 Black, Latina, and American Indian women
   science students reacted to their undergraduate science classes. I
   focused on the meanings they made of the common features of university
   science documented by Seymour and Hewitt (1997), including large,
   competitive, fast-paced classes, poor teaching, and an unsupportive
   culture. I also explored their responses to the values manifested in
   their science classes and laboratories. The research took place at a
   large, predominantly White research university; participants were
   recruited from a science enrichment program for high-achieving
   students. I interviewed the participants and attended science classes
   and laboratories with them. I analyzed the data using J. Spradley's
   semantic structural analysis method (1979, 1980) and validated it
   through triangulation and member-checking. The women in the study found
   three features of science classes particularly discouraging: the size
   of the lecture classes, asking and answering questions in class, and
   (in some cases) engaging in undergraduate research. They were
   negatively impacted by two cultural values: a narrow focus on
   decontextualized science and the construction of science as a gender-,
   ethnicity-and race-neutral meritocracy. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Concepts and findings from research on identity development are
   employed to better understand why current science teacher preparation
   programs are failing to prepare teachers who are able and choose to
   implement the vision for science education articulated in professional
   standards. Identity theory is used as a theoretical lens to make sense
   of and better address some of the unique challenges of becoming a
   reform-minded science teacher, a professional identity that does not
   reflect the common norm in the profession; these challenges include the
   emotional risk and possible need for "repair work," lack of familiarity
   with and buy-in into complex practices of inquiry, and the need for
   opportunities to participate in competent practice and have this
   participation acknowledged. Two basic design principles for science
   teacher preparation are identified as a result of this analysis: (a)
   the need to create safe places and scaffolded ways for beginning
   science teachers to try on and develop their identities as
   reform-minded science teachers, which may include capitalizing on the
   unique opportunities of practice teaching in out-of-school contexts;
   and (b) the need to offer opportunities to be recognized, by self and
   others, as reform-minded teachers through ongoing, structured, and
   supported reflection. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This longitudinal case-study aimed at examining whether purposely
   teaching for the promotion of higher order thinking skills enhances
   students' critical thinking (CT), within the framework of science
   education. Within a pre-, post-, and post-post experimental design,
   high school students, were divided into three research groups. The
   experimental group (n=57) consisted of science students who were
   exposed to teaching strategies designed for enhancing higher order
   thinking skills. Two other groups: science (n=41) and non-science
   majors (n=79), were taught traditionally, and acted as control. By
   using critical thinking assessment instruments, we have found that the
   experimental group showed a statistically significant improvement on
   critical thinking skills components and disposition towards critical
   thinking subscales, such as truth-seeking, open-mindedness,
   self-confidence, and maturity, compared with the control groups. Our
   findings suggest that if teachers purposely and persistently practice
   higher order thinking strategies for example, dealing in class with
   real-world problems, encouraging open-ended class discussions, and
   fostering inquiry-oriented experiments, there is a good chance for a
   consequent development of critical thinking capabilities.

AB The question of what students gain by engaging in socioscientific
   inquiry is addressed in two ways. First, relevant literature is
   surveyed to build the case that socioscientific issues (SSI) can serve
   as useful contexts for teaching and learning science content. Studies
   are reviewed which document student gains in discipline specific
   content knowledge as well as understandings of the nature of science.
   SSI are also positioned as vehicles for addressing citizenship
   education within science classrooms. Although the promotion of
   citizenship goals seems widely advocated, the specifics of how this may
   be accomplished remain underdeveloped. To address this issue, we
   introduce socioscientific reasoning as a construct which captures a
   suite of practices fundamental to the negotiation of SSI. In the second
   phase of the project, interviews with 24 middle school students from
   classes engaged in socioscientific inquiry serve as the basis for the
   development of an emergent rubric for socioscientific reasoning.
   Variation in practices demonstrated by this sample are explored and
   implications drawn for advancing socioscientific reasoning as an
   educationally meaningful and assessable construct.

AB Research into children's ideas showed that children's interpretations
   of natural phenomena often differ from those of scientists. The aim of
   our study was to identify children's ideas of various age classes
   (7/8-14/15) about birds. A questionnaire with 31 multiple choice and
   open ended questions and eight photographs were administered to 495
   children from 10 elementary schools in Slovakia. Children's ideas were
   examined in six dimensions (bird classification, food, senses,
   communication, migration and breeding including parental care). We
   found several misconceptions, some of them with both anthropomorphical
   and teleological reasoning of the children about birds within each
   dimension. In general, misconceptions were more frequently found in
   younger children, but several misconceptions were similarly distributed
   across all age classes.

AB Studies from different theoretical traditions investigating children's
   inheritance and genetics concepts have adopted a cross-sectional
   method. This paper is the first to examine both cross-sectional and
   longitudinal changes in children's basic genetic concepts. It forms
   part of a larger investigation into the development of intuitive
   inheritance and genetics concepts in childhood. Four age cohorts (4-5
   years, 7-8 years, 10-11 years, 14-15 years) were interviewed
   individually at two measurement occasions (T1, N=182; T2, N=164)
   separated by a 1-year interval. Cross-sectional analyses revealed an
   increase in children's knowledge of genetics by 10 years. Between 10
   and 14 years, there were fewer changes in the content of children's
   knowledge, especially at the level of scientific genetic understanding.
   There was little evidence of longitudinal changes over the 1-year
   period. Overall, children may hold an understanding of genetics that is
   tied to knowledge of inheritance within families. This may pose
   challenges for acquiring more abstract and formal concepts of genes.

AB The Israeli high school biology curriculum comprises the Biomind
   program, in which students are engaged in an open inquiry learning
   process. The dynamic features of open inquiry often pose challenges to
   teachers in implementing the Biomind program. The current qualitative
   research shows that facilitating students in a dynamic open inquiry
   process is multidimensional. Teaching practices cover a wide range of
   methods, from structured inquiry through guided inquiry to open
   inquiry. An individual teacher's profile can be elucidated on the basis
   of this spectrum. In addition, we realised that teachers often
   encounter several difficulties in implementing open dynamic inquiry: A
   dearth of teachers' scientific knowledge, students' lack of scientific
   knowledge and skills, and a restrictive time-frame. This study suggests
   several areas which should be considered while implementing an on going
   professional development support for teachers who are engaged in open
   inquiry teaching.

AB How do students bridge everyday life views into physics understanding?
   We report from in-depth analysis of one group of four students,
   video-recorded over 135 min solving a context rich problem (CRP).
   Through transcripts of the group's conversations and from flow-charts
   made of the group talk we have categorised how students' experiences
   develop into physics reasoning. The conversations in the cooperative
   group are sometimes carried out by "exploratory talks", but there are
   also parts of the conversation where the students develop their own
   thoughts without response from the others. Some evidence is given of:
   1) how the students use exploratory talks to reach consensus about the
   boundary conditions of the task; 2) how the students state the problem
   more precisely by starting to talk about experiences they have had and
   to use their experiences as arguments, and 3) how individual questions
   are formulated in a process of meaning making. We find in this
   case-study that students' personal everyday life experience develops
   into physics reasoning during group talk. We argue accordingly for more
   time in the physics classroom to solve open ended physics problems
   which promote group discussions taking departure from own experiences
   and enhance physics understanding.

TI Common characteristics of models in present-day scientific practice
SO RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION

DT Article

ID TEACHERS VIEWS; SCIENCE
AB Teaching the use of models in scientific research requires a
   description, in general terms, of how scientists actually use models in
   their research activities. This paper aims to arrive at defining common
   characteristics of models that are used in present-day scientific
   research. Initially, a list of common features of models and modelling,
   based on the literature was compiled. Next, a questionnaire was
   developed, which consisted of 10 statements with which the common
   features of models were probed. A sample of 77 research papers from
   'hard science' journals was drawn. The questionnaire was sent to the
   first author of the selected articles. The useful response was 24
   (31%). From an analysis of the results, it was concluded that the
   consulted scientists more or less agreed with the initial list of
   common features of models and modelling. However, some characteristics
   were perceived differently by the respondents, or formulated in
   different terms. This has led us to revise some of the features in our
   list. It is recommended that in science curricula and science text
   books, more attention should be paid to modern uses of models (e.g., in
   the context of computer simulation and technological design), and that
   aspects of the nature of models (e.g., the relation between model and
   target, and possible limitations of a model), which are underexposed in
   education, are addressed more explicitly.

AB Reform-based curriculum materials have been suggested as a mechanism to
   make inquirybased instruction more prevalent in secondary science
   classrooms, specifically when accompanied by comprehensive professional
   development (Loucks-Horsley, Hewson, Love, & Stiles, 1998; Powell &
   Anderson, 2002). This research examines the implementation of a
   reform-based high school chemistry curriculum in a large, urban school
   district. We explicitly consider the role of the teachers' knowledge
   and beliefs in their implementation of the reform-based chemistry
   curriculum, as well as school level factors. Qualitative and
   quantitative data were collected in the form of beliefs interviews and
   classroom observations from 27 high school chemistry teachers. Analysis
   of the data revealed that implementation of the curriculum was strongly
   influenced by the teachers' beliefs about teaching and learning, and
   the presence of a supportive network at their school sites. (c) 2007

AB This study explores the relationship between affective and cognitive
   variables in grade 9 chemistry students (n = 73). In particular, it
   explores how students' situational interest, their attitudes toward
   chemistry, and their chemistry-specific self-concept influence their
   understanding of chemistry concepts over the course of a school year.
   All affective variables were assessed at two time points: at the middle
   of the first semester of grade 9, and at the end of the second semester
   of grade 9, and then related to students' postinstructional
   understanding of chemical concepts. Results reveal that none of the
   affective variables measured at the earliest time point have a
   significant direct effect on postinstructional conceptual
   understanding. Looking at the different affective variables as
   intermediary constructs, however, reveals a pattern in which
   self-concept and situational interest measured at the middle of grade 9
   contribute to self-concept measured at the end of grade 9, which in
   turn, has a positive, significant effect on students' postinstructional
   conceptual understanding. These results reveal the importance of a
   strong and positive self-concept, the feeling of doing well in the
   chemistry class, for developing a meaningful understanding of
   scientific concepts. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In this article we apply a novel analytical framework to explore
   students' difficulties in understanding molecular genetics-a domain
   that is particularly challenging to learn. Our analytical framework
   posits that reasoning in molecular genetics entails mapping across
   ontologically distinct levels-an information level containing the
   genetic information, and a physical level containing hierarchically
   organized biophysical entities such as proteins, cells, tissues, etc.
   This mapping requires an understanding of what the genetic information
   specifies, and how the physical entities in the system mediate the
   effects of this information. We therefore examined, through interview
   and written assessments, 10th grade students' understandings of
   molecular genetics phenomena to uncover the conceptual obstacles
   involved in reasoning across these ontologically distinct levels. We
   found that students' described the genetic instructions as containing
   information about both the structure and function of biological
   entities across multiple organization levels; a view that is far less
   constrained than the scientific understandings of the genetic
   information. In addition, students were often unaware of the different
   functions of proteins, their relationship to genes, and the role
   proteins have in mediating the effects of the genetic information.
   Students' ideas about genes and proteins hindered their ability to
   reason across the ontologically distinct levels of genetic phenomena,
   and to provide causal mechanistic explanations of how the genetic
   information brings about effects of a physical nature. (c) 2007 Wiley

TI Effects of active-learning experiences on achievement, attitudes, and
   behaviors in high school biology
SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING
LA English

DE biology; laboratory science; achievement
ID INQUIRY-BASED SCIENCE; STUDENT PERFORMANCE; CURRICULA
AB Active-learning labs for two topics in high school biology were
   developed through the collaboration of high school teachers and
   university faculty and staff and were administered to 408 high school
   students in six classrooms. The content of instruction and testing was
   guided by State of Texas science objectives. Detailed teacher records
   describing daily classroom activities were used to operationalize two
   types of instruction: active learning, which used the labs; and
   traditional, which used the teaching resources ordinarily available to
   the teacher. Teacher records indicated that they used less independent
   work and fewer worksheets, and more collaborative and lab-based
   activities, with active-learning labs compared to traditional
   instruction. In-class test data show that students gained significantly
   more content knowledge and knowledge of process skills using the labs
   compared to traditional instruction. Questionnaire data revealed that
   students perceived greater learning gains after completing the labs
   compared to covering the same content through traditional methods. An
   independent questionnaire administered to a larger sample of teachers
   who used the lab-based curriculum indicated that they perceived
   changing their behaviors as intended by the student-centered principles
   of the labs. The major implication of this study is that
   active-learning-based laboratory units designed and developed
   collaboratively by high school teachers and university faculty, and
   then used by high school teachers in their classrooms, can lead to
   increased use of student-centered instructional practices as well as
   enhanced content knowledge and process learning for students. (c) 2007

AB To examine how school characteristics are tied to science and
   engineering views and aspirations of students who are underrepresented
   in science and engineering fields, this mixed-methods study explores
   relationships between aspects of students' science identities, and the
   representation of women among high school science teachers.
   Quantitative analyses tested the hypothesis that percent female faculty
   would have a positive effect on girls' science interests, and
   perceptions in particular, given the potentially greater availability
   of women role models. Findings indicate that percent female science
   faculty does not have an effect on a range of science measures for both
   male and female students, including the ways in which they understand
   scientific practice, their science self-concept, and their interest in
   science-related college majors. As qualitative data demonstrate, this
   could reflect practical constraints at schools where female faculty are
   concentrated and narrow perceptions of science teachers and "real"
   science. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This paper illustrates a 5-year case study (from 2001 to 2005)
   regarding a course in educational technology that involved from 100 to
   150 student teachers per year for a total of more than 500 trainees.
   Since the first version of the course, which was entirely based on a
   face-to-face approach, computer mediated collaborative learning
   techniques have gradually been introduced into the training program.
   The paper outlines the main problems faced in the various versions of
   the course, where different combinations were experimented with, and
   discusses the solutions adopted. The difficulties concern the demands
   of a large, diversified population and the methodological problems
   related to the non-neutrality of the introduction of online learning in
   the socio-cultural and organizational context of the study. The
   solutions include a highly flexible course design and a good balance
   and strict integration between traditional and online training
   techniques in the delivery of the course and in the assessment of
   trainees. Finally, we suggest possible directions for further research
   aimed at facilitating the infusion of online techniques in initial
   teacher training.

   which guides learners by generating advice on the next best step to
   take in a self-study e-learning course. The article draws on log data
   and responses from online questionnaires to provide insights into
   learners' evaluation of the tool, their adherence to the advice and
   their expectations of self-efficacy. The theoretical underpinnings of
   the work are described together with the experimental set-up. Results
   show that more than half of the learners in the experimental group
   adhered to the advice and held the opinion that the advice stimulated
   them to proceed with the course. Learners expressed a need to know what
   the advice was based on which can be seen as an essential element in
   future development of the tool.

   computer-mediated communication (CMC), studies into CMC are also
   included in the review. Male dominance is found to play a role in many
   CMC settings. A learning culture with an explicit focus on
   participation by all students seems to be related to a more
   gender-balanced participation in CMC, however. A tendency for boys to
   be more active participants than girls is also present in CSCL
   environments, but it is less pronounced than in CMC. This may be
   explained by the fact that participation is explicitly promoted in most
   CSCL environments. Gender differences in the character of students'
   contributions are found in both CMC and CSCL. It is concluded that in
   order to avoid gender-stereotyped participation and communication
   patterns, it is necessary to explicitly address inclusiveness as an
   aspect of a collaborative classroom culture. A plea is made for further
   research into differential participation by students in CSCL, and the
   effects thereof on cognitive and affective learning outcomes. Research
   should also focus on the question how classroom cultures can be
   promoted that support active participation of all students aimed at
   collaborative knowledge construction.

AB This study examined the effect of scaffolding learning components in a
   computerized environment, for students solving qualitative science
   problems in a simulation of laboratory experiments. Four scaffolding
   components were identified (structural, reflective, subject-matter and
   enrichment) and used in different configurations to construct four
   unique cognitive and meta-cognitive support programs based on human
   teaching. These ranged from low (Enrichment) to full support
   (Integrated). We compared the scaffolded groups with one another and
   with a non-scaffolded control group. A 'mathematics and reading
   comprehension' questionnaire was used to divide the participants (n =
   473) into ability levels. At different points of time, achievement
   outcomes were measured by three open-ended subject-matter
   questionnaires, tapping knowledge and understanding. The findings
   indicate differential effects of the support programs mostly in the
   following order: Integrated > Strategic > Operative > Enrichment >
   Control. The structural component seems to be a sine qua non for
   success and has a consistent and powerful influence. The combination of
   reflection and structural components, however, are needed for superior
   achievement. Both reflection and subject-matter components work
   cumulatively over time.

TI Making sense of epistemic categories. Analysing students' use of
   categories of progressive inquiry in computer mediated collaborative
   activities
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE discussion and inquiry software; epistemic categories; interaction
   analysis; progressive inquiry; socio-cultural theory
ID DISCOURSE; TECHNOLOGY
AB The topic of this article concerns how students make sense of
   categories of progressive inquiry made available to them through a
   discussion and inquiry type of software called Future Learning
   Environments 2 (FLE2). The idea behind tools of this kind is to induce
   approaches to school-work that build on the metaphor of learning as
   research. By pursuing a socio-cultural perspective on the topic of
   categories and categorization, we analyse in detail how students make
   sense of these categories, including how their sense-making relates to
   other concerns they have to manage when engaged in the institutional
   practices of studying. We demonstrate that students encounter
   significant challenges when engaged in the categorization work required
   by FLE2 and its underlying pedagogical model of progressive inquiry.
   Therefore, we conclude that to develop educational practices similar to
   the scientific practices on which such tools rely is more complex than
   merely following a step-by-step model of inquiry. To be able to
   evaluate truth claims and factuality involves the mastery of a whole
   range of historically developed skills and knowledge, and it is
   therefore not surprising that the students find it difficult to make
   adequate interpretations of what the categories entail, and how they
   should be used.

DE 1 : 1 laptops; classroom technology practices; ubiquitous computing
AB The purpose of this study was to document typical use and configuration
   of 1:1 computing in two schools focusing on the added value and unique
   challenges these uses present. A qualitative case study design was used
   in two middle schools (sixth, seventh and eighth grade) in the
   south-eastern United States purposefully selected for their 1:1
   computing programmes. Data were collected through formal and informal
   interviews, direct observations and site documents. Results indicated
   that online research, productivity tools, drill and practice, and
   eCommunications were the most frequent uses of computers in the 1:1
   classroom. Moreover, the 1:1 classroom provided potentially
   transformative added value to these uses while simultaneously
   presenting unique management challenges to the teacher. In addition,
   the presence of 1:1 laptops did not automatically add value and their
   high financial costs underscore the need to provide teachers with
   high-quality professional development to ensure effective teaching. In
   order to create effective learning environments, teachers need
   opportunities to learn what instruction and assessment practices,
   curricular resources and classroom management skills work best in a 1:1
   student to networked laptop classroom setting. Finally, researchers
   documented wide variation in fidelity to 1:1 computing, which suggests
   the need for further research exploring the conditions under which this
   variation exists.

   journal TechTrends' ethics columns, this paper provides empirical data
   regarding ethical issues associated with the use of instructional
   technology in design and training situations. In-depth interviews of 20
   professional technologists were conducted. The three most prominent
   ethical concerns reported were copyright, learner privacy, and
   accessibility. The results of this study also identified three ethical
   issues that have not been discussed extensively in the literature:
   diversity, conflicts of interest, and professionalism/confidence. In
   addition to identifying ethical issues, the findings of the study also
   contribute to the current literature through identifying coping
   strategies of ethical issues adopted by professional technologists.
   Finally, implications to researchers, managers, and practitioners were
   discussed.

AB This study investigated the effect of well- vs. ill-structured problem
   types on: (a) group interactional activity, (b) evolution of group
   participation inequities, (c) group discussion quality, and (d) group
   performance in a synchronous, computer-supported collaborative learning
   (CSCL) environment. Participants were 60 11th-grade science students
   working in three-member groups (triads) who were randomly assigned to
   solve a well- or an ill-structured problem scenario on Newtonian
   Kinematics. Although groups solving ill-structured problems generated
   more problem-centered interactional activity (a positive effect), they
   also exhibited participation patterns that were more inequitable (a
   negative effect) than groups solving well-structured problems.
   Interestingly, inequities in member participation patterns exhibited a
   high sensitivity to initial exchange and tended to get "locked-in"
   early in the discussion, ultimately lowering the quality of discussion
   and, in turn, the group performance. Findings and their implications
   for theory, methodology, and scaffolding of CSCL groups are discussed.

   master's level research course. Factors that defined the curriculum
   design problem included the subject matter, a view of learning as a
   change in identity, and the role of technology in curriculum design.
   Both the design process and results of research on the implementation
   of the course are described. The paper concludes with a retrospective
   discussion of lessons learned, including parallels of (a) user-centered
   technology design with our final approach to curriculum design and (b)
   socially constructed views of technology with socially constructed
   views of learning.

DE learning object; technology integration; design; classification;
   representations; presentation object; practice object; simulation
   object; conceptual model object; information object; contextual

AB The learning object remains an ill-defined concept, despite numerous
   and extensive discussion in the literature. This paper attempts to
   address this problem by providing a classification that potentially
   brings together various perspectives of what a learning object may be.
   Six unique types of learning objects are proposed and discussed:
   presentation, practice, simulation, conceptual models, information and
   contextual representation objects. The common characteristics of each
   are synthesized in a proposal that a learning object is best described
   as a representation designed to afford uses in different educational
   contexts. The classification of learning objects proposed could be
   useful as a framework for designers of digital resources and for those
   engaged in use of these resources in educational contexts.

   Development, 51(3), 63-81) involving the Diagnostic Pathfinder (dP)
   (previously Problem List Generator [PLG]), a cognitive tool for
   learning diagnostic problem solving. In studies 1 and 2, groups of 126
   and 113 veterinary students, respectively, used the dP to complete
   case-based homework; groups of 120 and 199, respectively, used an
   alternative method. Students in the dP groups scored significantly
   higher (p = .000 and .003, respectively) on final exams than those in
   control groups. In the third study, 552 veterinary students responding
   to a questionnaire indicated that the dP's gating and data synthesis
   activities aided learning. The dP's feedback and requirement of
   completeness appear to aid learning most.

DE ontology-driven e-learning system; competency acquisition
AB The importance given to competency management is well justified.
   Acquiring new competencies is the central goal of any education or
   knowledge management process. Thus, it must be embedded in any software
   framework as an instructional engineering tool, to inform the runtime
   environment of the knowledge that is processed by actors, and their
   situation toward achieving competency-acquisition objectives. We
   present here some of our results in the last 10 years that have led to
   an ontology for designing competency-based learning and knowledge
   management applications. Based on this ontology, we present a software
   framework for ontology-driven e-learning systems.

AB For a single authoring environment to be sufficiently general to be
   applicable to contexts across the whole lifespan of learning, some of
   the benefits that come from knowledge-rich domain specificity have to
   be sacrificed. Consequently, it is an open question as to whether it is
   possible to achieve effective learning environments from a generic
   tool. REDEEM is an authoring environment that aims to achieve this by
   creating adapted and interactive learning environments from existing
   courseware. In this paper, a 10-year research program is described that
   has assessed the usability, functionality, and effectiveness of
   REDEEM's approach.

TI An operational approach for building learning environments supporting
   cognitive flexibility

LA English
DT Article
DE e-learning; constructivism; instructional design; operational criteria;
   open-source platform
AB Constructivism is a learning theory that states that people learn by
   actively constructing their own knowledge, based on prior knowledge. A
   significant number of ICT-based constructivist learning systems have
   been proposed in recent years. According to our analysis, those systems
   exhibit only a few constructivist principles, and a critical problem
   related to the design and use of this kind of systems has been the lack
   of a practical means to facilitate the instructional design process.
   Our research aims to help designing truly constructivist learning
   environments. Our approach is based on a set of operational criteria
   for certain aspects of constructivism: We use these criteria as a
   useful pedagogical framework to provide easy-to-use tools and
   operational guidelines for teachers to build ICT-based constructivist
   learning environments. One facet often mentioned as being strongly
   relevant to constructivism is cognitive flexibility. This paper
   presents COFALE - a new, domain-independent, and open-source e-learning
   platform that could be used to devise learning conditions fostering
   cognitive flexibility - and an example of its use: the design of a
   course on recursion in computing science.

AB This paper presents an ontology-based framework aimed at explicit
   representation of context-specific metadata derived from the actual
   usage of learning objects and learning designs. The core part of the
   proposed framework is a learning object context ontology, that
   leverages a range of other kinds of learning ontologies (e. g., user
   modeling ontology, domain ontology, and learning design ontology) to
   capture the information about the real usage of a learning object
   inside a learning design. We also present some learner-centered and
   teacher-centered scenarios enabled by the proposed framework in order
   to illustrate the benefits the framework offers to these key
   participants of any learning process. Finally, we demonstrate how two
   present educational tools (i.e. TANGRAM and LOCO-Analyst) correspond to
   the proposed architecture.

DE social software; transactional distance; control; Web 2.0;
   self-organization
AB Social software, such as blogs, wikis, tagging systems and
   collaborative filters, treats the group as a first-class object within
   the system. Drawing from theories of transactional distance and
   control, this paper proposes a model of e-learning that extends
   traditional concepts of learner-teacher-content interactions to include
   these emergent properties of the group. It suggests that this feature
   of social software can facilitate an approach to e-learning that is
   qualitatively different from and capable of significantly augmenting
   traditional methods, with especial benefits for lifelong learners and
   those outside institutional boundaries. The paper goes on to explore
   some of the dangers and issues that need to be addressed in order for
   this new model to fulfill its promise, and to suggest a framework of
   principles to be used by designers of educationally-oriented social
   software.

AB With vigorous development of the Internet, especially the web page
   interaction technology, distant E-learning has become more and more
   realistic and popular. Digital courses may consist of many learning
   units or learning objects and, currently, many learning objects are
   created according to SCORM standard. It can be seen that, in the near
   future, a vast amount of SCORM-compliant learning objects will be
   published and distributed cross the Internet. Facing huge volumes of
   learning objects, learners may be lost in selecting suitable and
   favorite learning objects. In this paper, an adaptive personalized
   recommendation model is proposed in order to help recommend
   SCORM-compliant learning objects from repositories in the Internet.
   This model adopts an ontological approach to perform semantic discovery
   as well as both preference-based and correlation-based approaches to
   rank the degree of relevance of learning objects to a learner's
   intension and preference. By implementing this model, a tutoring system
   is able to provide easily and efficiently suitable learning objects for
   active learners.

AB The information overload in learning and teaching scenarios is a main
   hindering factor for efficient and effective learning. New methods are
   needed to help teachers and students in dealing with the vast amount of
   available information and learning material. Our approach aims to
   utilize contextualized attention metadata to capture behavioural
   information of users in learning contexts that can be used to deal with
   the information overload in user centric ways. We introduce a schema
   and framework for capturing and managing such contextualized attention
   metadata in this paper. Schema and framework are designed to enable
   collecting and merging observations about the attention users give to
   content and their contexts. The contextualized attention metadata
   schema enables the correlation of the observations, thus reflects the
   relationships that exists between the user, her context and the content
   she works with. We illustrate with a simple demo application how
   contextualized attention metadata can be collected from several tools,
   the merging of the data streams into a repository and finally the
   correlation of the data.

AB This paper introduces a ubiquitous computing environment in order to
   support the learners while doing tasks; this environment is called
   PERKAM (PERsonalized Knowledge Awareness Map). PERKAM allows the
   learners to share knowledge, interact, collaborate, and exchange
   individual experiences. It utilizes the RFID ubiquities technology to
   detect the learner's environmental objects and location, then
   recommends the best matched educational materials and peer helpers in
   accordance with the detected objects and the current location. This
   environment provides the learner with Knowledge Awareness Map, which
   visualizes the space of the environmental objects that surround the
   learner, the educational materials space, and the peer helpers' space.
   PERKAM system was implemented and an experiment was done in order to
   evaluate the system performance and the learner's satisfaction. This
   paper illustrates the design, the implementation and the evaluation of
   this environment, and it focuses on Knowledge Awareness Map, which is
   personalized according to the learner's current need and location.

   review
AB Since the explosion in multimedia computing, educators have been trying
   to work their way towards integrated human-computer interaction.
   Consequently, a large number of multimedia tools have been created,
   always following the trend of simpler and easier multimedia
   development. After outlining the transition from hardcore programming
   to modern multimedia authoring systems, this paper leads the way
   through a large variety of products, trying to determine the criteria
   upon which one should base a software investment. To facilitate this
   attempt, a series of variables is introduced and, based on these
   variables, a typical evaluation takes place. Following that pattern,
   each tool is examined separately so that a reasonable amount of data is
   gathered and treated as the basis for a 5-scale point system. Informal
   as this may be, it not only helps in ranking the tools examined, but
   also in extracting the necessary statistics. A black spot on this
   analysis is the absence of education-related data, since no software
   package was found to be able to play a clear educational role. As a
   result to all the above, a top-7 list is presented, always based on the
   previously stated subjective criteria. The purpose of this work is to
   shed light on the case of multimedia computing, aiming to find a tool
   that could serve a purely educational purpose in the field of live
   presentations. The absence of such a tool is the conclusion of the
   whole study.

ID ART
AB Although there is no agreement as to what instructional interactivity
   and interaction mean in educational literature, researchers agree that
   both terms are vital for teaching and learning one way or another. This
   paper presents the item-development stages and validity and reliability
   analyses of the Interactivity Survey (IS), which attempts to uncover
   the perceptions of professors working at departments of education from
   universities around the world. To provide evidence of reliability of
   the instrument, a pilot study was carried out with a sample size of 262
   universities. All of the statistical test results and the final version
   of the instrument were provided. Thus, this paper is both a theoretical
   paper that conceptually synthesizes the literature on instructional
   interactivity and a technical paper that considers the information from
   an instrument-development point of view.

AB Narrative and story telling has a long history of use in structuring,

   narrative based interactive intelligent learning environment which aims
   to elucidate practical reasoning using interactive emergent narratives
   that can be used in training novices in decision making. Its design is
   based on an approach to generating narrative from knowledge that has
   been modelled in specific decision/reasoning domains. The approach uses
   a narrative model that is guided partially by inference and contextual
   information contained in the particular knowledge representation used,
   the Generic/Actual argument model of structured reasoning. The approach
   is described with examples in the area of critical care nursing
   training and positive learning outcomes are reported.

AB Within an authentic assessment regime, a student is evaluated in terms
   of their ability to demonstrate application of a body of knowledge to a
   scenario situated in an actual, or a near replica of a real-world
   context. At Universitas 21 Global (U21Global), a completely online
   graduate school backed by 16 universities from around the world, the
   entire pedagogical model is founded on such an approach. One unique
   feature of the U21Global model is its interactive examination
   instrument which harnesses the power of the various information and
   communication technologies (ICTs). This instrument, referred to as the
   Open-Book Open-Web (OBOW) exam, presents students with a description of
   a simulated business problem using multimedia. They are then asked to
   assume a particular role and make recommendations about how to go about
   solving the problem. Feedback to date indicates that students are
   generally very positive about OBOW exams. On the minus side, the
   construction of OBOW exams presents a number of challenges. Not least
   of these is the steep learning curve it presents for exam authors
   unaccustomed to working within this paradigm.

DE accessible information technology; assistive technology; needs
   assessment; disability
AB Although federal U. S. regulations require schools to provide equal
   access to educational opportunities for all students, many technologies
   used in K-12 schools present accessibility barriers for students with
   disabilities. Interviews assessed knowledge of educational department
   staff, teachers, and parents of children in K-12 schools in the Pacific
   Northwest U. S. regarding accessible electronic and information
   technology, barriers to technology access, and the capacity of these
   school systems to address information technology (IT) accessibility
   issues. Results indicate staff and parents have some basic knowledge of
   IT accessibility issues, but significant barriers remain regarding
   appropriate implementation of accessible IT within Northwest K-12
   schools. These schools continue to address information technology
   accessibility on a case-by-case basis, rather than making systemic
   improvements to the accessibility of technology for all students.
   Systemic barriers exist regarding system-wide policies of
   accessibility, a lack of funds for training and implementation, and
   lack of communication between educators, administrators, IT staff and
   parents. Recommendations for improving services are provided.

AB The purpose of this study was to analyze the current status of
   computer-based technology (CBT) use in secondary schools in Taiwan. A
   questionnaire was developed to investigate teachers' attitudes toward
   computers and their application of CBT in instruction. We randomly
   sampled 100 secondary school science teachers and found that in general
   they did use CBT for accessing the internet and other teaching-related
   work. The surveyed teachers had a very positive attitude toward
   computers, yet we found their attitude was significantly correlated
   with their age and seniority. The older and more senior teachers
   generally held a less positive attitude toward computers. As for the
   application of computer-based technology in classroom instruction, most
   teachers claimed at least a moderate degree of implementation of CBT in
   the classroom. In gender difference, male teachers in general used more
   CBT in their instructional strategies than did female teachers. As far
   as age was concerned, middle-aged and more experienced teachers tended
   to integrate more CBT into their instruction than younger and novice
   teachers, even though the latter group held a more positive attitude
   toward computers. In correlation analysis we discovered that with male
   but not with female teachers, there was a direct correlation between
   degree of positive attitude toward computers and degree of application
   of CBT in classroom instruction.

AB Based on the hypothesis that inconclusive research results with regard
   to the impact of games and simulations are linked to the absence of
   clear concept definitions, research was undertaken to fill this
   methodological gap by identifying the essential attributes of games and
   simulations. This paper first introduces the context for our study.
   This is followed by a description of the analysis grid used to create a
   database of the literature, and the methodology employed to conduct our
   systematic review of this literature. The essential attributes of games
   and simulations are then described and the distinctions between these
   two concepts are presented.

AB Much of the research on collaborative work focuses on the quality of
   the group outcome as a measure of success. There is less research on
   the collaboration process itself, but an understanding of the process
   should help to improve both the process and the outcomes of
   collaboration. Understanding and analyzing collaborative learning
   processes requires a fine-grained analysis of group interaction in the
   context of learning goals. Taking into account the relationships among
   tasks, products and collaboration this paper presents a set of measures
   designed to evaluate the collaborative learning process. We emphasise:
   direct system-based measures based on data produced by a collaborative
   learning system during the collaboration process, and suggest that
   these measures can be enhanced by also considering participants'
   perceptions of the process.

AB Ontologies have the potential to play an important role in
   instructional design and the development of course content. They can be
   used to represent knowledge about content, supporting instructors in
   creating content or learners in accessing content in a knowledge-guided
   way. While ontologies exist for many subject domains, their quality and
   suitability for the educational context might be unclear. For numerous
   subjects, ontologies do not exist. We present a method for domain
   experts rather than ontology engineers to develop ontologies for use in
   the delivery of courseware content. We will focus in particular on
   relationship types that allow us to model rich domains adequately.

AB In this study, a desktop virtual reality earth motion system (DVREMS)
   is designed and developed to be applied in the classroom. The system is
   implemented to assist elementary school students to clarify earth
   motion concepts using virtual reality principles. A study was conducted
   to observe the influences of the proposed system in learning.
   Twenty-one sixth-grade students participated in the study. Statistical
   results show that the scores in the pre-test and post-test
   significantly differ and using virtual reality can assist students in
   nderstanding the concepts. Besides, four design recommendations -
   information, spatial behavior, manipulation and concept representation
   - for improving the desktop VR system in education are also presented.

ID FUZZY PETRI-NET; LEARNING-SYSTEM
AB Due to the rise of e-Learning, more and more useful learning materials
   are open to public access. Therefore, an appropriate learning
   suggestion mechanism is an important tool to enable learners to work
   more efficiently. A smoother learning process increases the learning
   effect, avoiding unnecessarily difficult concepts and disorientation
   during learning. However, many suggestion demands come from different
   abstraction levels, and traditional single level frequent pattern
   mining is not sufficient. This paper proposes a methodology for mining
   frequent patterns of learners' behavior which connote a hierarchical
   scheme to provide cross-level learning suggestions for the next
   learning course. With this system, a learner can get multiple levels of
   abstract suggestions instead of merely single level frequent pattern
   mining results. Our study shows that the algorithms can mine
   considerable quantities of frequent patterns from real life learning
   data. The experimental data are collected from a Web learning system
   originating from National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan. The proposed
   methodology gives learners many suggestions to help them learn more
   effectively and efficiently. Finally, we collect some representative
   cases to realize different requirements which are extracted from a
   learners' access database. These cases are classified into three types;
   notably, type three generalized four meaningful external factors which
   are inferred by our observations from these cross-level frequent
   patterns.

AB We report on the construction and application on an instrument entitled
   the " Science Achievement Influences Survey" to assess combined effects
   of student attitudes about science, peer interaction, and home support,
   and the frequency of student-centred and teacher-centred instructional
   practices on student achievement. Controlling for pre-test content
   knowledge, results indicated that student-centred teaching practices
   have a positive association with student achievement (p < .01; i. e.,
   group experiments) and a negative association with teacher-centred
   teaching practices (p < .01; i. e., copying notes). Additionally,
   student attitudes about science were positively associated with
   student-centred teaching practices (p < .01) and negatively associated
   with teacher-centred teaching practices (p < .01). Most significantly,
   this study documents the predicted gains in science achievement
   associated with frequency of specific instructional practices used by
   middle-school science teachers. Especially noteworthy and significant
   is the finding that near-daily implementation of group experiments and
   reduction of extensive note-copying during class yield the greatest
   positive impact on student achievement. Outside of school, peer
   interaction and home support were not significantly associated (p >
   .05) with student achievement. The student sample included 611
   middle-school science students with a wide range of socioeconomic and
   cultural backgrounds.

AB This article explores the meaning of the nature of science education to
   enhance scientific literacy. It argues that the teaching approach for
   science education should be regarded as " education through science",
   rather than " science through education". A model of the nature of
   science education is proposed, having its foundations based on activity
   theory rather than logical positivism. This encompasses an
   understanding of the nature of science, with links to achievement of
   goals in the personal domain, stressing intellectual and communication
   skill development, as well as the promotion of character and positive
   attitudes, plus achievement of goals in the social education domain,
   stressing cooperative learning and socio-scientific decision-making.
   Although the nature of science is seen as an important component of
   science education, the over-riding target for science teaching in
   school, as an aspect of relevant education, is seen as responsible
   citizenry, based on enhancing scientific and technological literacy.
   The meaning of scientific and technological literacy is discussed.

TI Building scientific literacy in HIV/AIDS education: A case study of
   Uganda
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; SCIENCE; INSTRUCTION; FRAMEWORK; DESIGN
AB The term scientific literacy is defined differently in different
   contexts. The term literacy simply refers to the ability for one to
   read and write, but recent studies in language literacy have extended
   this definition. New literacy research seeks a redefinition in terms of
   how skills are used rather than how they are learned. Contemporary
   perspectives on literacy as a transfer of learned skills into daily
   life practises capture the understanding of what it means to be
   scientifically literate. Scientific literacy requires students to be
   able to use their scientific knowledge independently in the everyday
   world. Some models for teaching towards scientific literacy have been
   suggested including inquirybased learning embedded in constructivist
   epistemologies. The inquiry-based model is posited to be effective at
   bringing about in-depth understanding of scientific concepts through
   engaging students' preconceptions. In order to establish whether
   directly engaging students' preconceptions can lead to in-depth
   understanding of the science of HIV/AIDS, a case study was designed to
   elucidate students' prior knowledge. From questionnaires and classroom
   observations, Ugandan Grade 11 students' persistent preconceptions were
   explored in follow-up focus group discussions. The inquiry process was
   used to engage students with their own perceptions of HIV/AIDS during
   the focus group discussions. Findings suggest that students need to
   dialogue with each other as they reflect on their beliefs about
   HIV/AIDS. Dialogue enabled students to challenge their beliefs while
   making connections between 'school' and 'home' knowledge.

ID SOCIO-SCIENTIFIC ISSUES; KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION; ELEMENTARY TEACHERS;
   SCIENCE-EDUCATION; DECISION-MAKING; ARGUMENTATION; DILEMMAS; GENETICS;
   CONCEPTIONS; COGNITION
AB This case study investigated the implementation of an inquiry-based
   curricular unit that was designed to promote student discourse and
   debate on aspects related to the nature of science, using a
   socioscientific issue of genetically modified foods. Two high school
   science classrooms participated in the study that took place over seven
   consecutive 1.5-h period blocks. The researchers utilized qualitative
   procedures to analyze students' views on the nature of science as
   expressed through their answers to online and interview questions, and
   to examine features of argumentation and discourse in the final
   classroom debate. The students' answers to questions related to the
   nature of science reflected conceptions of the tentative, creative,
   subjective, and social aspects of science. Yet aspects of the nature of
   science did not enter into the debate discussions. Instead students
   utilized more factual-based content of the evidence that ultimately led
   into numerous instances of fallacious reasoning and personal attacks.
   These findings suggest that perhaps a socioscientific issues approach
   to exploring aspects of the nature of science should be designed so
   that students are moved beyond developing their nature of science
   conceptions to applying those conceptions within a decision-making
   context.

TI The Usefulness of a Science Degree: The "lost voices" of science
   trained professionals
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper reports a study of science graduates who are employed in
   positions outside their discipline specialisation. The research was
   designed to uncover the reasons for them choosing to study science at
   university, the competencies they utilise in their work and their
   lives, and how these relate to their undergraduate education in
   science. The study is seen as important in that already about one-half
   of science graduates are in such positions and it is argued that there
   is a need in scientific and technologically based societies to have a
   greater representation of such people in decision-making positions in
   government and industry. The directions for the science degree that can
   be drawn from the data gathered are congruent with those arising from
   other relevant studies. That is, attention should be paid to widely
   used skills, such as communication and problem-solving, and to
   developing an understanding of science within its social and ethical
   context. An argument is mounted for considering the way the science
   degree is presented to potential students and to the general public.

AB This longitudinal study of middle school science teachers explored the
   relationship, if any, between teacher participation in whole-school,
   sustained, collaborative professional development and student
   achievement in science. Eleven teachers from Glendale Middle School
   participated in the Discovery Model Schools Initiative 2-week summer
   institute, followed by monthly release day professional development
   ses!,ions focused on implementing instruction outlined in the National
   Science Education Standards. Student achievement was assessed using the
   Discovery Inquiry Test in Science. The same students cornpleted the
   test in grades 6-8. Students of teachers at Glendale Middle School
   significantly outperformed students at the control school. Findings in
   this study revealed the positive impact that whole-school, sustained,
   collaborative professional development programs have on student
   achievement, indicating that programs of this nature could be a means
   to narrowing or eliminating achievement gaps in science. (C) 2006 Wiley

AB This study examined middle and high school students' perceptions of a
   weeklong science experience with nanotechnology and atomic force
   microscopy. Through an examination of student self assessments and
   their writing, the study allowed us to examine some of the issues that
   may contribute to discrepancies that are seen between European-American
   and African-American students in science. The results of the study
   showed that after instruction, African-American students were
   significantly more likely to agree with the statement that "science
   involves mostly memorizing things and getting the right answer," than
   European-American students. In addition, European-American students
   were significantly more likely to write their newspaper stories from a
   first person perspective than their African-American peers. The results
   are discussed in light of the assessment task, students'
   interpretations of formal writing, cultural differences in thc use of
   language in writing, and possible cultural differences in students'
   perceptions of the science experience. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The aim of the present study was to gain a better understanding of
   students' perceived science competence by examining potentially related
   beliefs and perceptions in a diverse sample of middle and secondary
   students (N=1289). Results of hierarchical regression analysis showed
   that students' perceived science competence was related to: (a)
   students' age, gender, and ethnicity; (b) students' mastery and
   performance-approach goals; (c) students' self-perceptions of their
   ability to generate creative ideas (i.e., creative self-efficacy); and
   (d) students' perceptions of teacher support and press (i.e.,
   challenging academic demands). Of all these factors, creative
   self-efficacy was found to have the strongest positive relationship
   with students' perceived science competence. Implications for
   subsequent research are discussed. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; WAIT TIME; STUDENT; DISCOURSE; RESPONSES; CONTEXT
AB The purpose of this study was to find out how teachers use questions in
   classroom discourse to scaffold student thinking and help students
   construct scientific knowledge. The study was conducted in large-class
   settings where the medium of instruction was English although the
   students were non-native speakers of the language. Six teachers
   teaching grade 7 science classes from four schools participated in the
   study. Thirty-six lessons covering a range of topics were observed
   across a variety of lesson structures such as expository teaching,
   whole-class discussions, and laboratory work. The lessons were
   audiotaped and videotaped. Verbal transcripts of classroom discourse
   were analyzed interpretively. Particular attention was paid to
   question: ng exchanges that stimulated productive thinking in students,
   as manifested by their verbal responses. A framework was developed that
   included four questioning approaches adopted by the teachers. This
   included Socratic questioning, verbal jigsaw, semantic tapestry, and
   framing. This paper describes these various questioning approaches,
   their features, and the conditions under which they were used. It also
   discusses the implications of these approaches for instructional
   practice. The findings from this study have potential in translating
   research insights into practical advice for teachers regarding tactical
   moves in classroom discourse, and provide guidelines for teachers to
   increase their repertoire of questioning skills. (C) 2007 Wiley

AB One of the challenges of science education is for students to develop
   scientific knowledge that is personally meaningful and applicable to
   real-life issues. This article describes a middle-school science
   intervention fostering adolescents' critical reasoning in the context
   of HIV by strengthening their conceptual understanding of HIV biology.
   The intervention included two components: critical reasoning activities
   that fostered knowledge integration and application to real-world
   problem solving, and science writing activities that promoted argument
   building. Two seventh-grade classes participated in the study. One
   class participated in the critical reasoning and writing activities (CR
   & W); the other class participated in critical reasoning activities
   only (CR group). Results demonstrate significant pre- and posttest
   improvements on measures of students' HIV knowledge, HIV understanding,
   and critical reasoning about realistic scenarios in the context. of
   HIV, with the improvements being greater in the CR&W group. The
   discussion focuses on the role of conceptual knowledge in health
   reasoning, the role of science writing in fostering knowledge
   integration, and the benefits of a "thinking curriculum" approach to
   integrated health and science education. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals,

ID ENGLISH-LANGUAGE LEARNERS; PEDAGOGY; VALIDITY; CHILDREN
AB Striving for equitable assessments that can contribute to classroom
   learning for linguistic minorities is a goal of increasing importance
   as the national population of English language learners continues to
   rise. This study investigated classroom assessments for English
   learners in middle school life science courses in two California
   schools. A framework for equitable classroom assessments, "McCes -
   Sounds like Success," was used to refine and evaluate assessments in
   the study. Ways to improve two written assessments for advanced English
   learners were developed through teacher research and tested with a
   pretest/posttest design. Eleven changes to the items were developed,
   such as adding visual supports and dividing prompts into smaller units.
   Regression analyses of raw and Rasch modeled data from the pretest/
   posttest showed that both English only students and advanced English
   learners scored significantly better on the modified classroom
   assessments. A new perspective on validating equitable classroom
   assessments as opposed to standardized assessments for English learners
   is discussed. (C) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Discourse patterns during children's collaborative online discussions
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES

ID FACE-TO-FACE; COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION; ELECTRONIC MAIL;
   ARGUMENTATION
AB This article examines the discourse of 10 groups of children during
   text-based online discussions. Analysis of the discourse in the
   discussions showed that 8 different rhetorical moves, or argument
   stratagems, were used by most groups of children, whereas 3 other
   stratagems were used by I group. The use of argument stratagems
   snowballed; that is, once an argument stratagem emerged in a
   discussion, it tended to spread to other children in the Web group, and
   the likelihood that it would occur again remained high over the course
   of the discussion. Most stratagems began to spread when initiated by
   other children but not when introduced by the adult moderator. Children
   were eager to participate and displayed a high rate of participation in
   discussions with Webmates from distant classrooms. These findings
   suggest that collaborative online discussions may provide an effective
   instructional medium for promoting children's learning of reasoning
   strategies and thinking skills.

DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-EDUCATION; PROJECT-BASED SCIENCE; CLASSROOM;
   INQUIRY; WORK
AB Advancements in handheld computing, particularly its portability,
   social interactivity, context sensitivity, connectivity, and
   individuality, open new opportunities for immersive learning
   environments. This article articulates the pedagogical potential of
   augmented reality simulations in environmental engineering education by
   immersing students in the roles of scientists conducting
   investigations. This design experiment examined if augmented reality
   simulation games can be used to help students understand science as a
   social practice, whereby inquiry is a process of balancing and managing
   resources, combining multiple data sources, and forming and revising
   hypotheses in situ. We provide 4 case studies of secondary
   environmental science students participating in the program.
   Positioning students in virtual investigations made apparent their
   beliefs about science and confronted simplistic beliefs about the
   nature of science. Playing the game in "real" space also triggered
   students' preexisting knowledge, suggesting that a powerful potential
   of augmented reality simulation games can be in their ability to
   connect academic content and practices with students' physical, lived
   worlds. The game structure provided students a narrative to think with,
   although students differed in their ability to create a coherent
   narrative of events. We argue that Environmental Detectives is I model
   for helping students understand the socially situated nature of
   scientific practice.

ID CONCEPTUAL CHANGE
AB This article concerns the development of conceptual understanding of a
   physical phenomenon through the use of computational representations.
   It examines how students make sense of and interpret computational
   representations, and how their understanding of the represented
   physical phenomenon develops in this process. Eight studies were
   conducted, in which pairs of students were engaged in an exploratory
   activity of natural harmonic oscillation. They first explored physical
   oscillators (e.g., springs, pendulums) and then interacted with dynamic
   and interactive computational representations that represent aspects of
   natural harmonic oscillation. The analysis focuses on selected episodes
   demonstrating critical steps in the development of the students'
   understanding. It offers a detailed description of these steps and
   closely examines students' interaction with various features of the
   representations in order to identify the relations between use of
   representations and students' developing understanding. A theory of
   conceptual change, coordination class theory (diSessa & Sherin, 1998),
   is used to track the development process of students' understanding
   with representations. The detailed analysis aims to construct a model
   describing mechanisms of developing understanding through the mediation
   of computational representations. The significance of this study is in
   its close look at the detailed process of learning and conceptual
   change in computational environments.

AB This article proposes a mathematical model of Intelligent Tutoring
   Systems (ITS), based on observations of the behaviour of these systems.
   One of the most important problems of pedagogical software is to
   establish a common language between the knowledge areas involved in
   their development, basically pedagogical, computing and domain areas. A
   mathematical model, like the one proposed here, can facilitate the
   integration of these different areas, as it defines the elements that
   constitute the system and defines the technological tools to implement
   it. The article presents an example demonstrating how the formalization
   was used to design the adaptive mechanism of an ITS to adapt its
   Interface Module to some student characteristics. (C) 2005 Elsevier

AB Models represent a set of generic patterns to test hypotheses. This
   paper presents the CogMoLab student model in the context of an
   integrated learning environment. Three aspects are discussed:
   diagnostic and predictive modeling with respect to the issues of credit
   assignment and scalability and compositional modeling of the student
   profile in the context of an intelligent tutoring system/adaptive
   hypermedia learning system architectural pattern. The SOM-PCA, a
   collaborative-based data mining approach, is shown to be reusable for
   all three purposes above, enabling fast, objective implementations
   without requiring much intensive data collection. (C) 2005 Elsevier

AB Wireless data communications in form of Short Message Service (SMS) and
   Wireless Access Protocols (WAP) browsers have gained global popularity,
   yet, not much has been done to extend the usage of these devices in
   electronic learning (e-learning). This project explores the extension
   of e-learning into wireless/handheld (W/H) computing devices with the
   help of a mobile learning (m-learning) framework. This framework
   provides the requirements to develop m-learning applications that can
   be used to complement classroom or distance learning. A prototype
   application was developed to link W/H devices to three course websites.
   The m-learning applications were pilot-tested for two semesters with a
   total of 63 students from undergraduate and graduate courses at our
   university. The students used the m-learning environment with a variety
   of W/H devices and reported their experiences through a survey and
   interviews at the end of the semester. The results from this
   exploratory study provide a better understanding on the role of mobile
   technology in higher education. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB In recent years, designing useful learning diagnosis systems has become
   a hot research topic in the literature. In order to help teachers
   easily analyze students' profiles in intelligent tutoring system, it is
   essential that students' portfolios can be transformed into some useful
   information to reflect the extent of students' participation in the
   curriculum activity. It is observed that students' portfolios seldom
   reflect students' actual studying behaviors in the learning diagnosis
   systems given in the literature; we thus propose three kinds of
   learning parameter improvement mechanisms in this research to establish
   effective parameters that are frequently used in the learning
   platforms. The proposed learning parameter improvement mechanisms can
   calculate the students' effective online learning time, extract the
   portion of a message in discussion section which is strongly related to
   the learning topics, and detect plagiarism in students' homework,
   respectively. The derived numeric parameters are then fed into a
   Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict each learner's
   performance in order to verify whether they mirror the student's
   studying behaviors. The experimental results show that the prediction
   rate for the SVM classifier can be increased up to 35.7% in average
   after the inputs to the classifier are "purified" by the learning
   parameter improvement mechanisms. This splendid achievement reveals
   that the proposed algorithms indeed produce the effective learning
   parameters for commonly used e-learning platforms in the literature.

AB The growing concern of teachers to improve their theoretical classes
   together with the revolution in content and methods brought about by
   the New Information Technologies combine to offer students a new more
   attractive, efficient and agreeable form of learning.
   The case of Descriptive Geometry (DG) is particularly special, since
   the main purpose of this subject is not only to provide students with
   theoretical knowledge of Geometry and Drawing, but also to enhance
   their spatial perception, one of the seven forms of intelligence and
   the most essential and vital one in the training of any engineer, but
   one which has not been sufficiently fomented in pre-university or
   university education during recent years.
   With these premises, and with the aim of accelerating the students'
   learning process, animations were developed that permit the interactive
   observation by the students of the most important topics of Descriptive
   Geometry.
   The software used in the development of the animations is Macromedia
   Flash; a tool that allows very small vectorial graphics files to be
   created, thus facilitating their electronic transmission to any user
   connected to the network. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID CURVE
AB There is little theoretical or experimental research on how
   beginner-level trainees learn CAD skills in formal training sessions.
   This work presents findings on how trainees develop their skills in
   utilizing a solid mechanical CAD tool (Pro/Engineer version 2000i(2)
   and later version Wildfire). Exercises at the beginner and intermediate
   levels were designed so that several variations of a solid object are
   built by non-experienced trainees as they accumulate training time. In
   this case, trainees are fourth year mechanical engineering seniors and
   as such, they were of a similar technical and gender make-up. This
   assessment was conducted over the duration of training (16-week long
   semester). The test exercises were used to assess the trainees' speed
   and proficiency in the use of CAD by (1) measuring their performance
   time and (2) feature count (number of features-of-size used to build
   the test parts). Using performance time data, empirical learning curves
   are generated. Breaking these curves into declarative and procedural
   components provides insight into how fast the trainees develop
   cognitive and motor CAD skills. In order to confirm that this
   methodology can be extended to other CAD platforms, a follow-up study
   was performed on a different set of beginner-level trainees with
   similar make-up while using the same beginner-level parts but with a
   more recent version of Pro/Engineer: Wildfire. One significant result
   of this study is that the procedural and declarative components of CAD
   learning are largely cognitive. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The rapid development of computer and Internet technologies has made
   e-Learning become an important learning method. There has been a
   considerable increase in the needs for multimedia instructional
   material in e-Learning recently as such content has been shown to
   attract a learner's attention and interests. The multimedia content
   alone, however, does not necessarily result in significant positive
   learning performance and satisfaction. Moreover, it is expensive to
   design and develop multimedia instructional material. There is a lack
   of extant research to address the critical issue of how to develop
   effective multimedia instructional content that leads to desirable
   learning performance and satisfaction. The objective of our paper is to
   propose and empirically test a model that examines the impact of the
   fitness of instructional content and media on a learner's performance
   and satisfaction.
   Our research finds that whether it is learning score as an objective
   measure or learning satisfaction as a subjective measure, the course
   unit with high uncertainty and equivocality in content needs high
   richness media representation. On the other hand, it is ineffective to
   use high richness media to promote learning performance. (C) 2005

AB Research suggests that students learn better when studying a picture
   coupled with narration rather than on-screen text in a computer-based
   multimedia learning environment. Moreover, combining narration with the
   visual presence of an animated pedagogical agent may also encourage
   students to process information deeper than narration or on-screen text
   alone. The current study was designed to evaluate three effects among
   students learning about the human cardiovascular system: the modality
   effect (narration vs. on-screen text), the embodied agent effect
   (narration + agent vs. on-screen text), and the image effect (narration
   + agent vs. narration). The results of this study document large and
   significant embodied agent and image effects on the posttest
   (particularly retention items) but surprisingly no modality effect was
   found. Overall, the results suggest that incorporating an animated
   pedagogical agent - programmed to coordinate narration with gaze and
   pointing - into a science-focused multimedia learning environment can
   foster learning. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A new approach for constructing the concept map

DE adaptive learning environments; concept map; data mining; testing
   records
AB In recent years, e-learning system has become more and more popular and
   many adaptive learning environments have been proposed to offer
   learners customized courses in accordance with their aptitudes and
   learning results. For achieving the adaptive learning, a predefined
   concept map of a course is often used to provide adaptive learning
   guidance for learners. However, it is difficult and time consuming to
   create the concept map of a course. Thus, how to automatically create a
   concept map of a course becomes an interesting issue. In this paper, we
   propose a Two-Phase Concept Map Construction (TP-CMC) approach to
   automatically construct the concept map by learners' historical testing
   records. Phase 1 is used to preprocess the testing records; i.e.,
   transform the numeric grade data, refine the testing records, and mine
   the association rules from input data. Phase 2 is used to transform the
   mined association rules into prerequisite relationships among learning
   concepts for creating the concept map. Therefore, in Phase 1, we apply
   Fuzzy Set Theory to transform the numeric testing records of learners
   into symbolic data, apply Education Theory to further refine it, and
   apply Data Mining approach to find its grade fuzzy association rules.
   Then, in Phase 2, based upon our observation in real learning
   situation, we use multiple rule types to further analyze the mined
   rules and then propose a heuristic algorithm to automatically construct
   the concept map. Finally, the Redundancy and Circularity of the concept
   map constructed are also discussed. Moreover, we also develop a
   prototype system of TP-CMC and then use the real testing records of
   students in junior high school to evaluate the results. The
   experimental results show that our proposed approach is workable. (C)

ID CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; SCIENCE; DESIGN; COMPUTER
AB Economic pressures on universities and the emergence of new
   technologies have spurred the creation of new systems for delivering
   engineering laboratories in education, in particular simulations and
   remote-access laboratory systems. Advocates of simulation argue that
   physical labs needlessly consume university space and students' time.
   However, proponents of hands-on laboratories argue that student
   engineers should be exposed to real environments. Remote laboratories
   have appeared as a third option. These laboratories are similar to
   simulation techniques in that they require minimal space and time,
   because the experiments can be rapidly configured and run over the
   Internet. But unlike simulations, they provide real data. Studying the
   relative effiectiveness of these modes of delivering student
   laboratories is complex, for the underlying technology of the
   laboratory is just one of many possible factors that could influence
   effectiveness. For example, the interface to the equipment may be of
   importance, as might the discussions students have among themselves.
   This paper presents a model for testing the relative effectiveness of
   engineering laboratories in education that takes account of these and
   other factors. The results are presented for an assessment study
   comparing versions of remote labs versus hands-on labs in a
   junior-level mechanical engineering course on machine dynamics and
   mechanisms. The results suggest that students learned lab content
   information equally well from both types of laboratories, and that they
   have a realistic understanding and appreciation of the practical
   advantages of remote laboratories. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Most universities have invested in extensive infrastructure in the form
   on computer laboratories and computer kiosks. However, is this
   investment justified when it is suggested that students work
   predominantly from home using their own computers? This paper provides
   an empirical study investigating how students at a regional university
   multi-campus university use computer laboratories. The findings suggest
   that universities need to reassess the traditional driving force and
   expectation for extensive on-campus computing facilities as there is a
   huge underutilisation of these facilities. Instead it is recommended
   that alternative computing facilities in the form of student-centred
   facilities such as wireless hotspots could be provided. (C) 2005

AB Effective technology integration for teaching subject matter requires
   knowledge not just of content, technology and pedagogy, but also of
   their relationship to each other. Building on Schulman's [Schulman, L.
   S. (1987). Knowledge and teaching: foundations for a new reform.
   Harvard Educational Review, 57(l), 1-22] concept of pedagogical content
   knowledge, we introduce a framework for conceptualizing Technological
   Pedagogical Content Knowledge-TPCK [Mishra, P., Koehler, M.J., (in
   press). Technological pedagogical content knowledge: A new framework
   for teacher knowledge. Teachers College Record]. We report the results
   of a semester-long investigation of the development of TPCK during a
   faculty development design seminar, whereby faculty members worked
   together with masters students to develop online courses. Quantitative
   discourse analysis of 15 weeks of field notes for two of the design
   teams show participants moved from considering technology, pedagogy and
   content as being independent constructs towards a richer conception
   that emphasized connections among the three knowledge bases. Our
   analyses suggests that developing TPCK is a multigenerational process,
   involving the development of deeper understandings of the complex web
   of relationships between content, pedagogy and technology and the
   contexts in which they function. Pedagogic, pragmatic, theoretical, and
   methodological contributions are discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

LA English
DT Article
DE human-computer interface; intelligent tutoring systems; interactive
   learning environments; multimedia/hypermedia systems
AB At most Universities throughout the world Computer Aided Design is
   taught using commercial programs more suitable for business and
   industry than for teaching. This led us to write our own design program
   (GIcad) starting from the best-known standards on the market, but
   always avoiding unnecessary commands in the first steps of the learning
   process. GIcad constitutes a tool with a multitude of help messages to
   facilitate student self-training, it is very intuitive and has an
   attractive and dynamic graphic interface with a design that does not
   put off the beginner with a lot of options and commands.
   For three years - and with the collaboration of over 400 students in
   the first year of their course - we have been carrying out trials,
   experiments and tests of all kinds with GIcad and other commercial
   programs. The statistical analysis of the results obtained in the
   surveys show us that the personal preferences of the students and their
   learning times are very similar with both GIcad and commercial
   programs. But have we achieved our objective of dethroning the
   commercial programs? We can deduce that the students are aware of the
   importance of mastering the commercial programs they will encounter at
   work. Nevertheless, a large percentage of them prefer to consolidate
   the theoretical concepts and acquired practice with a program
   specifically written for that purpose and developed by our department.
   This program allows the students to indirectly learn the basis of CAD,
   so that the subsequent use of commercial tools poses no difficulty. (C)

TI Self-organising navigational support in lifelong learning: How

DE distributed learning environments; lifelong learning; navigation
ID MODEL; EDUCATION
AB Increased flexibility and modularisation in higher education
   complicates the process of learners finding their way through the
   offerings of higher education institutions. In lifelong learning, where
   learning opportunities are diverse and reach beyond institutional
   boundaries, it becomes even more complex to decide on a learning path.
   However, efficient and effective lifelong learning requires that
   learners can make well informed decisions. Drawing on principles of
   self-organisation and indirect social interaction, this article
   suggests solving the problem by analysing the paths followed by
   learners and feeding this information back as advice to learners facing
   navigational decisions. This article starts by introducing the
   principles of self-organisation and indirect social interaction. It
   describes how we expect the use of indirect social interaction using
   collaborative filtering to enhance effectiveness (completion rates and
   amount of progress) and efficiency (time taken to complete) in lifelong
   learning. The effects were tested in a controlled experiment, with the
   results showing effects on effectiveness though not on efficiency. The
   study shows that indirect feedback is a promising line of enquiry for
   navigational support in lifelong learning. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

TI Evaluating Bayesian networks' precision for detecting students'

DT Article
DE learning styles; student modeling; Bayesian networks; e-learning
AB Students are characterized by different learning styles, focusing on
   different types of information and processing this information in
   different ways. One of the desirable characteristics of a Web-based
   education system is that all the students can learn despite their
   different learning styles. To achieve this goal we have to detect how
   students learn: reflecting or acting; steadily or in fits and starts;
   intuitively or sensitively. In this work, we evaluate Bayesian networks
   at detecting the learning style of a student in a Web-based education
   system. The Bayesian network models different aspects of a student
   behavior while he/she works with this system. Then, it infers his/her
   learning styles according to the modeled behaviors. The proposed
   Bayesian model was evaluated in the context of an Artificial
   Intelligence Web-based course. The results obtained are promising as
   regards the detection of students' learning styles. Different levels of
   precision were found for the different dimensions or aspects of a
   learning style. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a student controlled computer
   program for high school mathematics based on instruction principles
   derived from Schoenfeld's theory of problem solving. The computer
   program allows students to choose problems and to make use of hints
   during different episodes of solving problems. Crucial episodes are:
   analyzing the problem, selecting appropriate mathematical knowledge,
   making a plan, carrying it out, and checking the answer against the
   question asked.
   The effectiveness of the computer program was evaluated by means of a
   pre-test-post-test quasi experimental design study. Four classes worked
   with the computer program in three periods of two consecutive weeks
   each, whereas five classes received only traditional mathematics
   education. These classes served as a control group. The results show
   evidence of intervention effectiveness. The students who worked with
   the computer program showed increased problem-solving ability compared
   to the students in traditional mathematics instruction. The use of
   hints could explain an essential part of the increase in students'
   problem solving skills. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Developers of educational multimedia programs have expectations about
   the way in which they will be used. These expectations can be broadly
   categorised as either functional (primarily related to the interface)
   or educational (related to learning designs, processes and outcomes).
   However, student users will not always engage with educational
   multimedia in the ways developers envisage and the adoption of a
   particular learning design, however well implemented, does not
   guarantee particular learning processes or outcomes. We investigated
   the relationship between intended and actual user behaviour by
   analysing detailed electronic records of user activities (audit trails)
   within a multimedia program in which medical students adopt the role of
   a doctor in a simulated clinical interview. Audit trails of 294 users
   across three years were analysed, focussing on two critical learning
   activities (interviewing and note taking). Cluster and chi(2) analyses
   revealed four distinct types of users: 'confused or strategic' (12.9%),
   'disengaged' (40.8%), 'expected' (26.5%) and 'diligent' (19.7%). Our
   work in the future will focus on using audit trails in investigations
   of students learning processes and outcomes in educational multimedia

AB Simulations make it possible to explore physical and biological
   phenomena, where conducting the real experiment is impracticable or
   difficult. The implementation of a software program describing and
   simulating a given physical situation encourages the understanding of a
   phenomenon it self. Fifty-nine students, enrolled at the Mathematical
   Methods for Engineers used LabVIEW to develop software programs able to
   simulate physical and biological phenomena. They reported on the
   simulated phenomena and on the adopted strategies for its planning and
   the development. The works produced by the students have been analyzed
   taking into account the understanding of the simulated phenomenon, and
   the used strategy in the planning and development of the software. We
   found out that the more the program works, the more students understand
   the phenomena they simulated. The analysis of the programs and of the
   methodology each student used in the software development phase showed
   the different strategies and the cognitive styles they used and the
   skills that the use of LabVIEW enables learners to acquire. (C) 2005

AB Goal: The use of an online game for learning in higher education aims
   to make complex theoretical knowledge more approachable. Permanent
   repetition will lead to a more in-depth learning.
   Objective: To gain insight into whether and to what extent, online
   games have the potential to contribute to student learning in higher
   education.
   Experimental setting: The online game was used for the first time
   during a lecture on Structural Concrete at Master's level, involving
   121 seventh semester students.
   Methods: Pre-test/post-test experimental control group design with
   questionnaires and an independent online evaluation.
   Results: The minimum learning result of playing the game was equal to
   that achieved with traditional methods. A factor called "joy" was
   introduced, according to [Nielsen, J. (2002): User empowerment and the
   fun factor. In Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox, July 7, 2002. Available from
   http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20020707.html.], which was amazingly high.
   Conclusion: The experimental findings support the efficacy of game
   playing. Students enjoyed this kind of e-learning. (C) 2005 Elsevier

AB In this paper, a methodological educational proposal based on
   constructivism and collaborative learning theories is described. The
   suggested approach has been successfully applied to a subject entitled
   "Computer Architecture and Engineering" in a Computer Science degree in
   the University of La Laguna in Spain.
   This methodology is supported by two tools: the Moodle platform as a
   collaboration framework among students and teachers and a free
   Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) processor simulator called SIMDE,
   developed by the authors to promote the experience and help the
   understanding of superscalar and VLIW processors.
   This work is described showing how the constructivist and collaborative
   approaches have been applied and how the activities have been
   structured temporarily in phases. This educational proposal has been
   validated and improved with the feedback of the students during two
   academic years.
   Furthermore, the methodological procedure is also suitable to be used
   not only in subjects with contents which require the understanding of
   dynamic situations but also in subjects with other requirements. (C)

AB There is a common assumption that hypermedia navigation is influenced
   by a learner's style of thinking, so people who are inclined to apply
   sequential and analytical strategies (left-thinkers) are thought to
   browse hypermedia in a linear way, whereas those who prefer holistic
   and intuitive strategies (right-thinkers) tend towards non-linear
   paths. An experiment was conducted to study both the effects of
   students' style of thinking on hypermedia navigation and the effects of
   primes aimed at inducing them to browse the hypermedia according to a
   given strategy. Two hundred undergraduates in different faculties were
   asked to visit a web-site. Navigation was preceded by some initial
   tasks (primes) that activated either the left- or the right-thinking
   style; 50 men and 50 women were randomly assigned to each of the two
   kinds of primes. Then participants were free to browse the hypermedia
   and navigational paths were tracked down. When navigation had been
   completed, a questionnaire measuring a preference for either the left-
   or the right-thinking style was filled out by participants. Analyses
   showed that primes influenced hypermedia navigation, leading
   participants to apply strategies consistent with the initial tasks. The
   participants' age and faculty did not influence their behaviour in
   navigation. Gender and frequency of computer use determined some minor
   differences in hypermedia browsing, whereas there was no evidence of
   any relationship between thinking style and behaviour in navigation.

AB A CD-ROM consisting of videos of two lessons by different teachers
   demonstrating exemplary science teaching was used to elicit, develop
   and track the changing conceptions of good science teaching of student
   teachers enrolled for the one-year Postgraduate Diploma in Education
   (PGDE) at several stages during the programme. It was found that the
   videos acted as an effective probe to elicit student teachers'
   conceptions and had significant impact on those conceptions at
   different stages of the programme through the provision of teacher
   models demonstrating exemplary teaching. The experience has extended
   novice teachers' awareness of alternative teaching methods and
   approaches not experienced in their own schooling, broadened their
   awareness of different classroom situations, provided proof of
   existence of good practices and prompted them to reflect on their
   current conceptions of good science teaching. Most importantly, the
   strategy of asking student teachers to watch the same videos on three
   separate occasions at different times of the course was recognized by
   them as a crucial element in facilitating their reflection on their
   changing conceptions of good science teaching.

AB Little research has been conducted on how students work when they are
   required to plan, build and evaluate artefacts in technology rich
   learning environments such as those supported by tools including flow
   charts, Labview programming and Lego construction. In this study,
   activity theory was used as an analytic tool to examine the social
   construction of meaning. There was a focus on the effect of teachers'
   goals and the rules they enacted upon student use of the flow chart
   planning tool, and the tools of the programming language Labview and
   Lego construction. It was found that the articulation of a teacher's
   goals via rules and divisions of labour helped to form distinct
   communities of learning and influenced the development of different
   problem solving strategies. The use of the planning tool flow charting
   was associated with continuity of approach, integration of problem
   solutions including appreciation of the nexus between construction and
   programming, and greater educational transformation. Students who flow
   charted defined problems in a more holistic way and demonstrated more
   methodical, insightful and integrated approaches to their use of tools.
   The findings have implications for teaching in design dominated
   learning environments.

AB The aim of this study was to compare the achievement of prospective
   primary science teachers in a problem-based curriculum with those in a
   conventional primary science teacher preparation program with regard to
   success in learning about gases and developing positive attitudes
   towards chemistry. The subjects of the study were 101 first year
   undergraduate students, who were in two different classes and who were
   taught by the same lecturer. One of the classes was randomly selected
   as the intervention group in which problem-based learning (PBL) was
   used, and the other as the control in which conventional teaching
   methods were used. The data were obtained through use of the gases
   diagnostic test (GDT), the chemistry attitude scale (CAS), and scales
   specific to students' evaluation of PBL such as the peer evaluation
   scale (PES), self evaluation scale (SES), tutor's performance
   evaluation scale (TPES) and students' evaluation of PBL scale (SEPBLS).
   Data were analysed using SPSS 10.0 (Statistical Package for Social
   Sciences). In order to find out the effect of the intervention (PBL) on
   students' learning of gases, independent sample t-tests and ANCOVA
   (analysis of co-variance) were used. The results obtained from the
   study showed that there was a statistically significant difference
   between the experimental and control groups in terms of students' GDT
   total mean scores and, their attitude towards chemistry, as well as PBL
   has a significant effect on the development of students' skills such as
   self-directed learning, cooperative learning and critical thinking.

TI When a bilingual child describes living things: An analysis of

ID ENGLISH; SCIENCE
AB With increasing numbers of students learning science through a second
   language in many school contexts, there is a need for research to focus
   on the impact language has on students' understanding of science
   concepts. Like other countries, Brunei has adopted a bilingual system
   of education that incorporates two languages in imparting its
   curriculum. For the first three years of school, Brunei children are
   taught in Malay and then for the remainder of their education,
   instruction is in English. This research is concerned with the
   influence that this bilingual education system has on children's
   learning of science. The purpose was to document the patterns of Brunei
   students' developing understandings of the concepts of living and
   non-living things and examine the impact in the change in language as
   the medium of instruction. A cross-sectional case study design was used
   in one primary school. Data collection included an interview (n = 75),
   which consisted of forced-response and semi-structured interview
   questions, a categorisation task and classroom observation. Data were
   analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. The results indicate that
   the transition from Malay to English as the language of instruction
   from Primary 4 onwards restricted the students' ability to express
   their understandings about living things, to discuss related scientific
   concepts and to interpret and analyse scientific questions. From a
   social constructivist perspective these language factors will
   potentially impact on the students' cognitive development by limiting
   the expected growth of the students' understandings of the concepts of
   living and non-living things.

AB This study draws on recent research on the central role of
   representation in learning. While there has been considerable research
   on students' understanding of evaporation, the representational issues
   entailed in this understanding have not been investigated in depth. The
   study explored students' engagement with evaporation phenomena through
   various representational modes. The study indicates how a focus on
   representation can provide fresh insights into the conceptual task
   involved in learning science through an investigation of students'
   responses to a structured classroom sequence and subsequent interviews
   over a year. A case study of one child's learning demonstrates the way
   conceptual advances are integrally connected with the development of
   representational modes. The findings suggest that teacher-mediated
   negotiation of representational issues as students construct different
   modal accounts can support enriched learning by enabling both (a)
   richer conceptual understanding by students, and (b) enhanced teacher
   insights into students' thinking.

AB Concepts learned in the classroom were reinforced and augmented by
   presenting them in a different context using cryogenics-based
   enrichment programmes (CBEPs) held in an out-of-school setting. The
   effectiveness of two CBEPs, which involve the use of liquid nitrogen
   and liquid oxygen, was explored. Using a sample of 265 upper primary
   students, it was found that both enrichment programmes were effective
   in promoting the learning of science concepts. Fair improvements,
   albeit only transient, in two attitude constructs, enjoyment of science
   and career preference, due to either CBEPs were detected. The CBEPs did
   not have any significant impact on the attitude construct relating to
   students' views on the social implications of science. The impact of
   CBEPs showed signs of retention, specifically in the cognitive realm,
   and reasonable indications of influencing subsequent learning and
   activities of students.

DE learning communities; cooperative/collaborative learning; distributed
   learning environments
AB Web-based (or online) learning provides an unprecedented flexibility
   and convenience to both learners and instructors. However, large online
   classes relying on instructor-centered presentations could tend to
   isolate many learners. The size of these classes and the wide
   dispersion of the learners make it challenging for instructors to
   interact with individual learners or to facilitate learner
   collaborations. Since extensive literature has confirmed that the
   substantial impact of learner interaction on learning outcomes, it is
   pedagogically critical to help distributed learners engage in
   community-based collaborative learning and to help individual learners
   improve their self-regulation. The E-learning lab of Shanghai Jiaotong
   University created an artificial intelligence system to help guide
   learners with similar interests into reasonably sized learning
   communities. The system uses a multi-agent mechanism to organize and
   reorganize supportive communities based on learners' learning
   interests, experiences, and behaviors. Through effective award and
   exchange algorithms, learners with similar interests and experiences
   will form a community to support each others' learning. Simulated
   experimental results indicate that these algorithms can improve the
   speed and efficiency in identifying and grouping homogeneous learners.
   Here, we will describe this system in detail and present its mechanism
   for organizing learning communities. We will conduct human
   experimentations in the near future to further perfect the system. (C)

AB This paper argues that the internet is built around key technology
   design features of openness, robustness and decentralisation. These
   design features have transformed into social features, which are
   embodied within the cultural values of the internet. By examining
   applications that have become popular on the net, the importance of
   these values is demonstrated. If e-learning is considered as a sub-set
   of internet activity, then the types of approaches that will be popular
   and meaningful for students will be those that appeal to these three
   core values. An examination of online communities reveals that these
   are indeed in keeping with these, and provide a valuable learning
   experience. The community can be seen as a natural conclusion in
   e-learning driven by the expectations of a generation of learners who
   have been enculturated into the values of the internet. (C) 2005

ID PARENT INVOLVEMENT; MODEL
AB Children's academic performance and social competence in school is
   positively associated with parent involvement. However, the researches
   about educational learning models often ignore the parent part.
   Moreover, Internet forms a new paradigm, education and communication
   approach is more complicated than ever. In this paper, we would like to
   introduce an Education Wheel model (EWM) which includes students,
   teachers and parents in the education environment. Under EWM framework,
   we design an E-Home-book System (EHS) with agents which provide a
   teacher-parent-student communication interface through Internet. The
   EHS comprises intelligent agents: interaction agent, instruction agent,
   information agent, evaluation agent and log agent. The agents manage a
   learning portfolio conception, observe and record students' e-learning
   behavior through the web log, and provide teachers a reference of
   portfolio information. The agents adopt a trigger function to analyze
   the students' learning behavior from Internet as well as from
   classroom, evaluate overall performance, then send an e-mail message
   automatically to the teachers and parents to guide and assist the
   students who need to revise their learning attitude. Similarly, the
   agents will record parents' participation portfolio, then teachers may
   draft better communication strategy. The EHS provides a better
   communication role between students-parents-teachers, implements an
   integrated performance measurement method, and conducts a better
   teaching strategy support interface for elementary education. (C) 2005

DE architectures for educational technology system; computer-mediated
   communication; cooperative/collaborative learning; distributed learning

AB Most asynchronous computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL)
   environments can be characterized as functional environments because
   they focus on functional, task-specific support, often disregarding
   explicit support for the social (emotional) aspects of learning in
   groups which are acknowledged by many educational researchers to be
   essential for effective collaborative learning. In contrast, sociable
   CSCL environments emphasize the social (emotional) aspects of group
   learning. We define sociability as the extent to which a CSCL
   environment is perceived to be able to facilitate the emergence of a
   sound social space with attributes as trust and belonging, a strong
   sense of community, and good working relationships. Specific
   environmental characteristics, which we have designated social
   affordances, determine sociability.
   This explorative study deals with the construction and preliminary
   validation of a self-reporting (Dutch language) Sociability Scale for
   determining the perceived degree of sociability of CSCL environments.
   It is one-dimensional Scale consisting of 10 items and has an internal
   consistency of 0.92. It was further validated on the basis of a
   well-developed nomological network. The results of the explorative
   study are promising and show that the sociability scale has the
   potential to be useful as a measure for perceived sociability. (C) 2005

ID ASTRONOMY
AB A, asynchronous discussion forum, become more prevalent in online and
   flexible-delivery modes of teaching, understanding the role that
   instructors play in student learning in these forums becomes an
   important issue. Whether the instructor chooses to lead discussions or
   to keep a low profile can affect student participation in surprising
   ways. In this study, we investigate how instructor participation rates,
   the timing of instructor postings (during or at the end of a forum) and
   nature of their postings (questions, answers or a mix of the two)
   relate to student participation and perception.
   Using archives containing over 40,000 postings to nearly 400 discussion
   forums, together with over 500 university evaluation survey responses
   collected over six consecutive semesters, we analysed student and
   instructor postings to discussion forums, student responses to
   university evaluation surveys, and instructor and student responses to
   surveys carried out as part of this project. We collected both
   quantitative and qualitative responses on how instructors believe they
   behave in discussion forums and compared these with statistical
   analysis of the forums, and then looked at how the instructors'
   behaviour correlated with students' participation and perceptions.
   We found that the way that instructors post to forums may influence
   students' forum discussions and participation in unexpected ways. We
   show that instructors' perceptions of how they teach online do not
   necessarily agree with our observations, and that intuitive measures
   such as the rate of student participation and the length of discussion
   threads are not necessarily good ways to judge the 'health' of
   discussion forums or the quality of learning taking place. (C) 2005

AB In this study, we design a learning environment that supports
   reflective activities for information seeking on the Web and evaluate
   its educational effects. The features of this design are: (1) to
   visualize the learners' search processes as described, based on a
   cognitive schema, (2) to support two types of reflective activities,
   such as "reflection-in-action" and "reflection-on-action", and (3) to
   facilitate reflective activities by comparing their own search
   processes to other learners' search processes. We have conducted an
   experiment to investigate the effects of our design. The experimental
   results confirm that: (1) the participants' search performance in the
   instructional group supported by our instructional design improved
   effectively than in the control group; (2) they changed their ideas
   about important activities when seeking information on the Web, and (3)
   they activated their search cycles more than the control group did. (C)

TI The reliability of content analysis of computer conference communication
SO COMPUTERS & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The focus of this article is the reliability of content analysis of
   students' computer conference communication. Content analysis is often
   used when researching the relationship between learning and the use of
   information and communications technology in educational settings. A
   number of studies where content analysis is used and classification
   systems are developed are presented and discussed along with the
   author's own development and use of a classification system.
   However, the question of the reliability of content analysis is not
   often addressed or discussed in the literature. On examining the
   reliability of classifications in an empirical study of study groups'
   academic discussions in computer conferences in a distance education
   course, the present author found the reliability to be extraordinarily
   low. For some classifications the deviation was as high as 13% when the
   same person (coder) classified the same computer conference message at
   two different times. When two different coders classified the same
   computer conference messages, the deviation was as high as 27%.
   This low reliability-and the lack of discussion of this crucial matter
   in the literature-has profound implications. Not just for the author's
   own research but for all studies and results based upon content
   analysis of computer conference communication. Therefore, this issue
   needs to be addressed.
   A possible solution-where each computer conference message can be
   classified as having both one and/or other kinds of information-is
   proposed. This might not be a solution to the problem of low
   reliability of content analysis and the use of classification systems,
   but it does shed light on the problem and goes some way towards
   reducing it. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We introduce an effective computer aided learning visual tool (CALVT)
   to teach graph-based applications. We present the robot motion planning
   problem as an example of such applications. The proposed tool can be
   used to simulate and/or further to implement practical systems in
   different areas of computer science such as graphics, computational
   geometry, robotics and networking. In the robot motion planning
   example, CALVT enables users to setup the working environment by
   creating obstacles and a robot of different shapes, specifying starting
   and goal positions, and setting other path or environment parameters
   from a user-friendly interface. The path planning system involves
   several phases. Each of these modules is complex and therefore we
   provide the possibility of visualizing graphically the output of each
   phase. Based on our experience, this tool has been an effective one in
   classroom teaching. It not only cuts down, significantly, on the
   instructor's time and effort but also motivates senior/graduate
   students to pursue work in this specific area of research. (C) 2005

AB Based on data collected from a middle school, this study investigates
   how the quantity and quality of technology use affect student learning
   outcomes. Specifically, this study examines how technologies are used
   by students, what technology uses are popular among students, and what
   technology uses are effective for increasing student academic
   achievement. Results suggest that the quantity of technology use alone
   is not critical to student learning. "How much" matters when "how" is
   identified. Moreover, when the quality of technology use is not
   ensured, more time on computers may cause more harm than benefit. With
   students' change in GPA as an indicator, technology uses that had
   positive impact on students were those related to specific subject
   areas and focused on student construction. In addition, analysis of the
   frequency of technology uses found that, in general, technology uses
   that had positive impact were not popular; on the contrary, some of
   these technology uses were the least frequently used. Implications for
   practice and future research are discussed in this paper. (C) 2005

   on- and off-campus students in an engineering management study unit
   examining issues in professional engineering ethics. An evaluation was
   conducted to assess the effectiveness of this new resource. Use of the
   video was optional, and about half of the class reported using the
   video, though usage was 90.0% for off-campus students. Most on-campus
   students accessed the video on-line, while all off-campus students
   accessed the video via CD-ROM. Off-campus students rated the
   educational value of the video higher than on-campus students, and were
   more likely to indicate that the video helped them understand the
   issues being studied. Most students were able to view the videos
   without any technical playback problems. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The aim of this study is to empirically investigate the relationships
   between communication styles, social networks, and learning performance
   in a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) community. Using
   social network analysis (SNA) and longitudinal survey data, we analyzed
   how 31 distributed learners developed collaborative learning social
   networks, when they had work together on the design of aerospace
   systems using online collaboration tools. The results showed that both
   individual and structural factors (i.e., communication styles and a
   pre-existing friendship network) significantly affected the way the
   learners developed collaborative learning social networks. More
   specifically, learners who possessed high willingness to communicate
   (WTC) or occupied initially peripheral network positions were more
   likely to explore new network linkages. We also found that the
   resultant social network properties significantly influenced learners'
   performance to the extent that central actors in the emergent
   collaborative social network tended to get higher final grades. The
   study suggests that communication and social networks should be central
   elements in a distributed learning environment. We also propose that
   the addition of personality theory (operationalized here as
   communication styles) to structural analysis (SNA) contributes to an
   enhanced picture of how distributed learners build their social and
   intellectual capital in the context of CSCL. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The objective, strategy, and implementation details of a new
   undergraduate course, Internet-based Instrumentation and Control, are
   presented. The course has a companion laboratory that is supported by
   the National Science Foundation and industry. The combination is
   offered to senior-level undergraduate engineering students interested
   in sensing, instrumentation, control, and web programming that want to
   learn more about the integration of these technologies for solving
   real-world engineering problems. The course will also be offered to
   gifted high school seniors with similar interests and can serve as a
   vehicle to attract them to engineering disciplines. Preliminary
   assessment of the first offering of the course is encouraging and has
   shown that the course has achieved success in helping students
   understand concepts and master basic technologies for developing
   Internet-based automatic systems. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This paper presents the results of a 3-year quasi-experimental study of
   three Masters courses in computing. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate the extent to which the teaching and learning of these
   courses were enhanced by being developed and delivered in an online
   format as compared to face-to-face full-time and part-time delivery.
   Key methodological questions and issues to be examined were: (a) any
   observable difference in student performance as measured by
   end-of-module grades/marks; (b) any observable difference between
   coursework and exam performance in the technically-oriented modules;
   (c) any observable difference in dropout rates, student satisfaction
   and faculty satisfaction. The study examined the results from 4684
   module enrolments, consisting of 269 online students, 796 part-time
   students, and 3619 full-time students distributed across 7 modules and
   79 module instantiations. The data was gathered using a variety of
   different means which included interviews, end of module
   questionnaires, student records and enrolment data. The results show
   that the online students consistently perform better then the
   face-to-face students and the paper reflects on this finding. (C) 2005

AB In this article we describe the use of mental states approach, more
   specifically the belief-desire-intention (BDI) model, to implement the
   process of affective diagnosis in an educational environment. We use
   the psychological OCC model, which is based on the cognitive theory of
   emotions and is possible to be implemented computationally, in order to
   infer the learner's emotions from his actions in the system interface.
   In our work we profit from the reasoning capacity of the BDI model in
   order to infer the student's appraisal (a cognitive evaluation of a
   person that elicits an emotion), which allows us to deduce student's
   emotions. The system reasons about an emotion-generating situation and
   tries to infer the user's emotion by using the OCC model. Besides, the
   BDI model is very adequate to infer and also model students affective
   states since the emotions have a dynamic nature. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Research into Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in
   schools is well into its third decade but there is still a pressing
   need to better understand how computer-based technologies are
   influencing learning opportunities, and how the local conditions of
   schooling impact on teachers' attempts to integrate these technologies
   in their classrooms. In this article, we provide some insight into
   these questions through our research in six diverse public schools in
   the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. We observed classrooms
   and conducted interviews with teachers and other key stakeholders, such
   as principals and technology coordinators about the integration of ICT.
   Our goal was to describe and examine the ways in which teachers, in a
   range of settings, are utilising ICT in their classroom practices to
   mediate student's learning experiences Our findings indicate that ICT
   is largely being integrated in ways that support and supplement
   existing classroom practices. From our observations, we believe that
   successful integration of ICT requires fundamental shifts in the core
   activities of schools. These shifts include new teaching. The cases
   described in this article suggest some ways in which these shifts may
   be initiated and sustained. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB E-learning, one of the tools emerged from information technology, has
   been integrated in many university programs. There are several factors
   that need to be considered while developing or implementing university
   curriculums that offer e-learning based courses. This paper is intended
   to specify e-learning critical success factors (CSFs) as perceived by
   university students. The published e-learning critical success factors
   were surveyed and grouped into 4 categories namely, instructor,
   student, information technology, and university support. Each category
   included several measures. The categorization was tested by surveying
   538 university students. The results revealed 8 categories of
   e-learning CSFs, each included several critical e-learning acceptance
   and success measures. The level of criticality of each measure was
   represented by its validity coefficient. Confirmatory factor modeling
   approach was used to assess the criticality of the measures included in
   each CSF category. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Shared databases are used for knowledge exchange in groups. Whether a
   person is willing to contribute knowledge to a shared database presents
   a social dilemma: Each group member saves time and energy by not
   contributing any information to the database and by using the database
   only to retrieve information which was contributed by others. But if
   all people use this strategy, then the database will be empty and,
   hence, useless for every group member. Based on theoretical approaches,
   two models for fostering the information-sharing behavior of database
   users are presented. One for enhancing the quality of database
   contents, and one for enhancing the quantity of those contents. The
   models take into account the following factors: the kinds of rewards
   the participants obtain for contributing information, the individual
   costs associated with this contribution, the prospective metaknowledge
   about the importance of one's own information to the others, and the
   retrospective metaknowledge about how much others contributed to and
   retrieved from the database. These factors enhance the quantity of
   database contents as well as their quality.
   A highly controlled experimental setting for testing the models is
   presented. Results of three experiments support some expectations
   derived from the models. Their implications for organizational and
   educational settings are discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Little research has been done examining the role of errors in learning
   computer software. It is argued, though, that understanding the errors
   that people make while learning new software is important to improving
   instruction. The purpose of the current study was to (a) develop a
   meaningful and practical system for classifying computer software
   errors, (b) determine the relative effect of specific error types on
   learning, and (c) examine the impact of computer ability on error
   behaviour. Thirty-six adults (18 males, 18 females), representing three
   computer ability levels (beginner, intermediate, and advanced),
   volunteered to think out loud while they learned the rudimentary steps
   (moving the cursor, using a menu, entering data) required to use a
   spreadsheet software package. Classifying errors according to six basic
   categories (action, orientation, knowledge processing, seeking
   information, state, and style) proved to be useful. Errors related to
   knowledge processing, seeking information, and actions were observed
   most frequently, however, state, style, and orientation errors had the
   largest immediate negative impact on learning. A more detailed analysis
   revealed that subjects were most vulnerable when observing, trying to
   remember, and building mental models. The effect of errors was
   partially related to computer ability, however beginner, intermediate
   and advanced users were remarkably similar with respect to the
   prevalence of errors. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article reports on a study into the impact of students' use of the
   Internet and the computer at home on digital skills they need for
   school. The study was conducted in the lower grades of Dutch secondary
   education (students aged 13-15). More than 2500 students, distributed
   over 116 classes in 68 schools, participated in the study. Internet and
   computer skills were measured by means of an objective test. Multilevel
   analysis was used to examine the impact of home access and use on
   Internet and computer skills taking into account the effect of
   students' backgrounds. Students in pre-university education,
   third-graders and non-minority students appeared to have better
   Internet skills and a more advantageous home computer use than students
   in pre-vocational education, first-graders and minority students,
   respectively. The Internet skills of girls were hardly less developed
   than those of boys. Home access to e-mail and the extent to which
   students use the home computer for surfing, e-malling, chatting and
   text processing were found to be substantially related to Internet and
   computer skills (taking into account the effect of several background
   characteristics of the students). (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Duo to the length, learning process associated with complicated
   clinical techniques, undergraduate radiotherapy students can struggle
   to access sufficient time or patients to gain the level of expertise
   they require. By developing a hybrid virtual environment with real
   controls, it was hoped that group learning of these techniques could
   take place away from the clinical departments.
   This paper presents initial evaluation of the use of a
   three-dimensional immersive visualisation environment (IVE) to simulate
   a working radiotherapy treatment machine. A virtual patient complete
   with a range of different treatment sites was used to enhance learning
   and teaching of beam alignment in 3D. Pre- and post-questionnaires were
   used to evaluate the perceptions of 42-year 1 pre-registration students
   with regards to the learning that had taken place.
   93% of students perceived an improvement in their understanding and
   confidence in their technical skills as a result of using the IVE. The
   mean overall improvement was 21.21/0 (p < 0.00001), and this was
   positively correlated to perceived realism of the application. The
   application was reported to be both realistic and enjoyable. Feedback
   suggested it has a role to play in development of technical skills and
   also pre-clinical induction. More work with the application is ongoing
   to clarify that role and the potential benefits of this technology. (C)

AB This work describes a framework that combines techniques from Adaptive
   Hypermedia and Natural Language processing in order to create, in a
   fully automated way, on-line information systems from linear texts in
   electronic format, such as textbooks. The process is divided into two
   steps: an off-line processing step, which analyses the source text, and
   an on-line step, which executes when a user connects to the system with
   a web browser, moment at which the contents and hyperlinks are
   generated. The framework has been implemented as the WELKIN system,
   which has been used to build three adaptive on-line information sites
   in a quick and easy way. Some controlled experiments have been
   performed with real users aimed to provide positive feedback on the
   implementation of the system. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) programme aims at testing
   practical skills and competences in using ICT tools. This paper
   presents the results of a monitoring exercise aimed at analyzing the
   impact of the ECDL programme in the Italian Universities. The ECDL
   programme, adopted in most Italian Universities since the year 2000,
   has involved several tens of thousands of students. Our investigation
   focused on the experiences of the Universities in the year 2003 and, in
   particular, on the organizational and teaching issues addressed for the
   implementation of the programme. The analysis has shown that the
   implementation relied on a large variety of choices about what concerns
   the teaching organization, the credits awarded to the students and the
   type of ECDL certification required. These choices varied as a function
   of the size of the Universities, whereas their geographical location
   did not seem to have any influence. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Wireless Internet technology is gaining a foothold on more and more
   campuses, yet few studies have investigated how wireless Internet
   supports and enhances a student-centered learning environment. This
   study seeks to fill the gap by developing an instrument to measure how
   wireless Internet supports student-centered learning. A web survey was
   designed and administered at a public university in the USA where
   participants were student wireless Internet users. Structural equation
   modeling employing Partial Least-Squares approach was used to test the
   research model. The model explains 77% of the variance (R 2) in
   student-centered learning environment. The survey results suggest that
   wireless Internet has a positive and significant influence on
   student-centered learning in three dimensions: pedagogical,
   technological, and cultural learning. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This study examined how 498 elementary and secondary educators use
   student response systems in their instruction. The teachers all
   completed an online questionnaire designed to learn about their goals
   for using response systems, the instructional strategies they employ
   when using the system, and the perceived effects of response systems.
   Participants in the study tended to use similar instructional
   strategies when using the technology as have been reported in higher
   education. These include posing questions to check for student
   understanding and diagnose student difficulties, sharing a display of
   student responses for all to see, asking students to discuss or rethink
   answers, and using feedback from responses to adjust instruction. A
   latent class analysis of the data yielded four profiles of teacher use
   based on frequency of use and breadth of instructional strategies
   employed. Teachers who used the technology most frequently and who
   employed broadest array of strategies were more likely to have received
   professional development in instructional strategies and to perceive
   the technology as more effective with students.

AB This article describes the design and formative evaluation of a
   Web-based tool that supports curriculum developers in constructing
   competence maps. Competence maps describe final attainment levels of
   educational programs in terms of-interrelated-competencies. Key
   requirements for the competence-mapping tool were validity and
   practicality. Validity refers to internal consistency and meaningful
   links to the external realities represented. Practicality refers to a
   design approach of evolutionary prototyping, in which feedback from
   intended users and domain experts is collected throughout the
   development process. Formative evaluations of four prototypes were
   conducted. Measures of design, appeal, goal, content, confidence and
   relevance showed that the tool is practical. The article describes the
   formative evaluation process and concludes with a description of the
   modified tool from the perspective of the user and the instructional
   designer.

AB This is a report of a developmental research study that aimed to
   construct and validate an instructional design (ID) model that
   incorporates the theory and practice of multiple intelligences (MI).
   The study consisted of three phases. In phase one, the theoretical
   foundations of multiple Intelligences and ID were examined to guide the
   development of such model. In phase two the model components were
   determined and an initial model was constructed. In phase three, the
   model was reviewed and validated by experts in the field of ID through
   a three-round Delphi study. The result was a revised and validated
   Multiple Intelligences Design Model. This paper presents the
   decision-making processes and procedures used in model development, and
   provides a framework for the internal validation of ID models using
   expert review procedures.

AB Although beloved of some chemists and physicists, science
   demonstrations have been criticized for stifling inquiry and assisting
   teachers to maintain a power differential between themselves and
   students in the classroom. This interpretive study reports the
   unexpected positive learning outcomes for urban science students in two
   chemistry classes that resulted from the use of science demonstrations
   during a unit on gas laws. Beginning with an examination of science
   demonstrations as sites of interactions, researchers observed greater
   student engagement and positive emotional energy, more sophisticated
   use by students of symbol systems associated with chemistry, and a
   greater willingness of students to move between description of the
   phenomena and submicroscopic explanations. Applying sociology of
   emotions to analysis of classroom conversations and actions, we examine
   the nature of engagement and propose explanations for the positive
   effect of science demonstrations on the engagement, emotional energy,
   and learning of students. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate students' conceptions
   about watersheds. Specifically: (1) What are students' conceptions of a
   watershed? and (2) In what ways might students' conceptions vary by
   grade level and community setting? This study was descriptive in nature
   and reflected a cross-age design involving the collection of
   qualitative data from 915 students from the Midwest, United States.
   These qualitative data were analyzed for their content in an inductive
   manner, identifying student's conceptions. This content analysis was
   followed with a statistical analysis to determine the significance in
   the frequency of the identified student conceptions. Four categories
   emerged that reflected these students' conceptions. Based on these
   findings, we make curricular recommendations that build on the
   students' conceptions, the watershed concept, and the National Research
   Council (1996) Science Education Standards. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals,

AB The traditional pedagogical approach for teaching chemical bonding is
   often overly simplistic and not aligned with the Most up-to-date
   scientific models. As a result, high-school students around the world
   lack fundamental understanding of chemical bonding. In order to improve
   students' understanding of this concept, it was essential to propose a
   systemic treatment, namely, revising the scientific content, the
   pedagogical approach, and the assessment methods regarding this
   concept. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to build a
   conceptual framework that provides an advanced scientific and
   pedagogical foundation regarding the chemical bonding concept-one that
   will guide chemistry curriculum developers as well. A conceptual
   framework for a new teaching approach was constructed with
   lead-chemistry teachers, science (chemistry) educators, and research
   chemists. We suggest that chemical bonding should be taught based on
   elemental principles and by using the idea of a continuum of bond
   strengths. Our process includes the formulation of learning goals
   aligned with current scientific knowledge. Moreover, we suggest that
   constructing assessment tasks on carefully specified learning goals,
   which are described in terms of learning performances, may enable
   educators to foster and examine much deeper levels of students'
   understanding. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID TEACHING TEACHERS; KNOWLEDGE
AB This study documents the views of effective professional development
   held by eight professional development (PD) providers, representing
   four informal science institutions (ISI) and four programs within two
   institutions of higher education (IHE) in a large midwestern
   metropolitan area in the United States. This study finds that, while
   the reported learning and outcome agendas of the providers were similar
   across the board, a dichotomy in approach to PD emerged according to
   the type of institution. This dichotomy between ISI and IHE was
   persistent across thematic categories: (1) language use and meaning,
   (2) teacher outcomes as a result of PD, (3) resource strengths for
   teaching and learning, and (4) determination of content and course
   offerings. The significance of this research is threefold. First, the
   identification and characterization of important features of teacher PD
   in ISI is an important contribution to the PD literature, since most
   previous studies focus on IHE. Second, this study elucidates important
   differences between the two types of providers with respect to their
   views of inquiry, currently a fundamental component of PD for science
   teachers. Third, previously unreported gaps and overlaps in belief
   systems of PD from two institutions types, ISI and IHE, are identified.

AB Many researchers and teacher educators propose that reflection is an
   important way teachers can think about changing their views and
   practices. The hierarchical constructs used to describe reflection,
   however, are often interpreted in ways that promote reflection as a
   tool teachers use to elevate their views and practices toward ideal
   "end goals" rather than as a more complex intellectual act that could
   help them learn how to shape their own goals. This research explores
   how four early career science teachers learned to negotiate the
   conflicts between their own goals and actual practices by situating
   their reflections in multiple contexts. They were invited to become
   aware of those conflicts through interviews and discussions of
   classroom observations and then to address them by actually teaching
   toward their own unrealized goals. The data generated from these
   activities were described with a rubric based on M. van Manen's
   reflection construct (1977) but were framed with certain perceptions
   each teacher had about her or his own science teaching. Several
   patterns emerged across the four teachers' cases that challenge the use
   of reflection as a tool and suggest how science teachers can reflect as
   a way to take greater ownership over and responsibility for their own
   lifelong learning. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID SCIENCE; BELIEF
AB Teaching the theory of evolution in classrooms takes place in a social,
   intellectual, and pedagogical context which must be considered with
   care if students are to receive a complete and authentic education. In
   addition to the science education literature on this topic, attention
   is directed to the expanding literature on science and religion, as
   well as the writing on religion and education. With attention to the
   contentious social context in which the theory of evolution is taught
   today, as well as the worldviews students bring to the classroom, a
   case is made for teaching the theory of evolution in a manner that
   takes account of the questions students bring with them and the broader
   philosophical considerations that impinge upon their thinking. (C) 2007

AB One-to-one computing environments change and improve classroom dynamics
   as individual students can bring handheld devices fitted with wireless
   communication capabilities into the classrooms. However, the screens of
   handheld devices, being designed for individual-user mobile
   application, limit promotion of interaction among groups of learners.
   This study proposes a design of classrooms that incorporates personal
   workspace and public workspace. Students use handheld devices as
   private workspace and work with peers on public workspace with shared
   displays through their handheld devices. Experiments confirmed that
   students with only handheld devices did not demonstrate expected
   participation ratios and actively interact with group members. The
   proposed shared display groupware promoted shared understanding of the
   workspace and increased awareness of partner actions. Collaboration was
   enhanced by creating the opportunity for students to use handheld
   devices to perform ideal communication patterns and avoiding
   ineffective communication patterns.

DE collaborative learning; practice-based teacher education; shared
   displays
AB Practice-based education is gaining a growing popularity in fields as
   diverse as, for example, software engineering, pedagogy and medical
   studies. In practice-based education learning takes place across
   different learning arenas and requires cooperation among all the actors
   involved in the learning process. However, mobility of students across
   these arenas impact deeply on cooperation patterns, and therefore on
   the learning process. In this paper we investigate the usage of shared
   display systems to promote cooperation among students in practice-based
   education. Our focus is on teacher education and the paper is based on
   our experiences with the teacher education programme at our university.
   Based on our observations of students out in practice, we discuss the
   importance of common spaces and the role of bulletin boards of
   different types. We then define high-level requirements for a shared
   display system to support practice-based education and we illustrate
   the main concepts with a demonstrator. Strengths and weaknesses of our
   approach are pointed out through an evaluation of the demonstrator.

AB This paper describes the development processes for a cross-platform
   ubiquitous language learning service via interactive television (iTV)
   and mobile phone. Adapting a learner-centred design methodology, a
   number of requirements were gathered from multiple sources that were
   subsequently used in TAMALLE (television and mobile phone assisted
   language learning environment) development. A number of issues that
   arise in the context of cross-platform user interface design and
   architecture for ubiquitous language learning were tackled. Finally, we
   discuss a multi-method evaluation regime to gauge usability, perceived
   usefulness and desirability of TAMALLE system. The result broadly
   revealed an overall positive response from language learners. Although,
   there were some reported difficulties in reading text and on-screen
   display mainly on the iTV side of the interface, TAMALLE was perceived
   to be a usable, useful and desirable tool to support informal language
   learning and also for gaining new contextual and cultural knowledge.

AB Experiential learning is the process of creating knowledge through the
   transformation of experience and has been adopted in an increasing
   number of areas. This paper investigates the possibility of
   technological support for experiential learning. A learning activity
   flow (or script) and a mobile technology system were designed to
   facilitate students in experiential learning. An experiment was
   conducted on two fifth-grade classes at an elementary school, one class
   using personal digital assistants (PDAs) and the other working without
   them. The results indicate that mobile technologies are effective in
   improving knowledge creation during experiential learning. The
   interplay between the mobile technology affordances and the proposed
   learning flow for experiential learning is thoroughly discussed.

DE context awareness; distributed intelligence; human attention; lifelong
   learning; situated action; wireless and mobile technologies
AB Individual, unaided human abilities are constrained. Media have helped
   us to transcend boundaries in thinking, working, learning and
   collaborating by supporting distributed intelligence. Wireless and
   mobile technologies provide new opportunities for creating novel
   socio-technical environments and thereby empowering humans, but not
   without potential pitfalls. We explore these opportunities and pitfalls
   from a lifelong-learning perspective and discuss how wireless and
   mobile technologies can influence and change conceptual frameworks such
   as the relationship between planning and situated action, context
   awareness, human attention, distances in collaborative design
   activities, and the trade-off between tools for living and tools for
   learning. The impact of wireless and mobile technologies is illustrated
   with our research projects, which focus on moving 'computing off the
   desktop' by 'going small, large, and everywhere'. Specific examples
   include human-centred public transportation systems, collaborative
   design, and information sharing with smart physical objects.

AB In 2005, the new quality standard for learning, education, and
   training, ISO/IEC 19796-1, was published. Its purpose is to help
   educational organizations to develop quality systems and to improve the
   quality of their processes, products, and services. In this article,
   the standard is presented and compared to existing approaches, showing
   the methodology and its advantages for educational organizations.
   However, since the standard is a reference model, it has to be adapted
   to the needs and requirements of an organization. Hence, the main
   aspect is the adoption and implementation process: How can ISO/IEC
   19796-1 successfully be implemented in educational organizations and
   support the variety of involved actors? To answer this question, the
   quality adaptation model identifies steps and instruments to bring the
   abstract standard into practice. The article closes with a case study
   evaluating the use and adequacy of the model.

   An institution's perspective
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY

DT Article
DE e-learning quality; benchmarking; complex dynamic systems; learning
   management systems (LMS)
AB Higher education institutions undertake a range of approaches to
   evaluating and making judgments about the quality of their e-learning
   provision. This paper begins by exploring benchmarking as one current
   strategy in common use in universities to identify and implement
   quality practices: from the use of checklists (for example, of best
   practices and standards) to a more contemporary dynamic systems
   approach involving continuous cycles of feedback and improvement
   centred around the learners' experiences of e-learning. These practices
   are influenced by the teachers' design of e-learning and emerging
   technologies as well as by the institutional and societal contexts in
   which both learners and teachers operate. We give an account of two
   major evaluation studies at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS),
   utilising a systems approach to investigate the consequences of
   e-learning, and we inquire into the value of this particular
   institutional approach for deriving e-learning quality. We use
   selections from the large dataset to describe and analyse students' and
   teaching staff's experiences of an e-learning system (LMS) over a
   two-year period. Our findings reveal that learners' experiences warrant
   consideration in shaping future e-learning developments at UTS, and
   that students value e-learning in facilitating their access to
   education for making choices about their learning and for enabling
   engagement in collaborative and interactive learning activities, while
   they also recognise the current constraints on e-learning imposed by
   the developers of LMS technologies.

DE evaluation; quality enhancement; e-learning implementation;

AB In relation to quality, evaluation is often used synonymously with
   quality assurance and monitoring processes (Ehlers et al, 2004).
   However, evaluation has other purposes, such as for development and
   knowledge (Chelimsky & Shadish, 1997). In this paper, I present a view
   of evaluation as an instrument of quality enhancement rather than
   quality assurance, one that can be used creatively and powerfully to
   strengthen an initiative. The case example is a five-year evaluation
   study of an institution-wide implementation of e-learning. The
   evaluation framework developed for this study has been constructed with
   three purposes in mind: monitoring, development, and knowledge. In this
   paper, I argue that the participatory nature of the devised evaluation
   framework has enhanced the quality of the initiative and afforded its
   embedding within pedagogical, technological, cultural, and
   organisational domains.

DE quality assurance; learning management system; leadership; policy;
   staff development; evaluation
AB This study describes a set of institutional indicators that suggest
   minimum standards for the quality assurance of learning supported by
   learning management systems in blended contexts. The indicators are
   evaluated by comparing seven universities that use a common learning
   management system to support student learning experiences. The
   responses to a qualitative questionnaire provide evidence of how the
   participating universities approach leadership, policy making,
   development, and evaluation as they relate to the quality assurance of
   learning management systems. A comparison among the universities
   reveals that they tend to have a better understanding of technical
   rather than educational issues related to quality assurance. A case is
   made for the need for universities to address key areas in order to
   reliably assure the quality of learning supported by learning
   management systems.

AB This study analyzed the factors that affect student success in an
   online computer programming course. The study had two with two main
   objectives. The first was to examine relationships among selected
   variables (gender, age, educational level, locus of control, and
   learning style), motivational beliefs (intrinsic goal orientation,
   extrinsic goal orientation, control beliefs, task value, self-efficacy,
   and test anxiety), self-regulated learning components (cognitive
   strategy use, self-regulation), and student success in the online
   course. The second objective was to examine course instructors' views
   about the factors that contribute to the students' success in the
   online course. The study sample consisted of two course instructors and
   80 voluntary participants who partook in this online course in
   2005-2006. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to
   collect relevant data in this study. Four online questionnaires
   (Demographic Survey, Internal-External Locus of Control Scale, Learning
   Style Inventory, and Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire)
   were used to gather data on quantitative variables, and semi-structured
   interviews were conducted to gather data on instructors' views. The
   statistical results indicated that the effect of the self-regulation
   variables on students' success was statistically significant, and the
   interview results indicated that successful students generally used
   self-regulated learning strategies in the online course.

ID NETWORKS
AB Virtual learning communities encourage members to learn and contribute
   knowledge. However, knowledge sharing requires mutual-trust
   collaboration between learners and the contribution of quality
   knowledge. This task cannot be accomplished by simply storing learning
   content in repositories. It requires a mechanism to help learners find
   relevant learning content as well as knowledgeable collaborators to
   work with. In this paper, we present a peer-to-peer based social
   network to enhance the quality of e-learning regarding knowledge
   sharing in virtual learning communities. From a technical viewpoint, we
   will present advanced semantic search mechanisms for finding quality
   content and trustworthy collaborators. From the social viewpoint, we
   will address how to support a trustworthy social network that
   encourages learners to share. Results of this research demonstrate that
   applying such mechanisms to knowledge sharing can improve the quality
   of e-learning in virtual learning communities.

SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE quality literacy; participatory quality development;
   professionalisation; co-production; educational quality; e-learning
AB The article suggests that stakeholders involved in quality development
   need a specific competence, called quality literacy, in order to
   successfully improve learning processes. We introduce and describe
   quality literacy as a set of competencies that are needed for
   professional quality development. Quality literacy emphasises the
   importance of professionalism as a necessary component for quality
   development, in addition to structural quality management models. We
   argue that quality development is a co-production between learners and
   their learning environment. This means that the educational process can
   only be influenced and optimised through participation and not steered
   externally. Quality strategies cannot, therefore, guarantee a high
   quality of learning processes but rather aim at professionalisation of
   the educational process and stakeholders. This article suggests
   participation and negotiation between educational stakeholders (clients
   and providers) as a main condition for quality development. In
   addition, we present a quality model that conceptualises quality as a
   potential that can only be achieved through interaction.

SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY

DT Article
DE quality standard; consumer-based quality assurance; quality mark;
   e-learning quality; quality certification
AB Emerging concerns about quality of e-learning products and services
   animated a project in Canada to create quality standards that derived
   primarily from the needs of consumer, that could be used to guide the
   development and choice of e-learning at all levels of education and
   training, and that could be implemented in a simple manner. A set of
   quality standards were created to reflect best practices in learning
   technologies, distance learning, and student-centred learning. The
   standards, first labeled the Canadian Recommended E-Learning
   Guidelines, are now available in the Creative Commons as the Open
   eQuality Learning Standards. To implement the standards, two tools were
   created: a Consumer's Guide to E-learning and a certification mark -
   the eQcheck quality mark - to indicate that e-learning courses,
   modules, and programs, and elements of them, meet those quality
   standards. The purpose is to provide consumer confidence in the
   e-learning enterprise and consumer protection for the investments made
   by individuals, agencies, and entire governments. This approach, a
   Canadian case study in e-learning quality assurance, differs
   substantially from other e-learning quality initiatives, making a
   unique contribution to the e-learning quality assurance dialogue.

   assess the accuracy and usefulness of information in web-based learning
   environments. Based upon the results of a pioneering and qualitative
   study on information commitments, this study aimed to develop an
   Information Commitments Survey (ICS) for assessing the information
   commitments of 1220 college and graduate students. A series of
   multivariate multiple regression analyses were also conducted to
   evaluate the ability of students' evaluative standards as well as their
   Internet experiences for predicting their online searching strategies.
   The results showed that the ICS was deemed to be sufficiently reliable
   for assessing students' information commitments. Gender differences
   regarding the participants' usage of certain searching strategies were
   found in this study. Moreover, the students' grade level as well as
   their Internet experiences played a significant role in their
   information commitments. The multivariate multiple regression analyses
   revealed that both the students' use of sophisticated evaluative
   standards and their Internet experiences significantly predicted the
   use of sophisticated searching strategies, while their use of less
   advanced evaluative standards significantly predicted the use of less
   advanced searching strategies.

AB This study investigates students' perceptions of the "effective
   dimensions of interactive learning" in a hybrid course. A case- study
   design was used, and 25 students enrolled in "Computer Networks and
   Communication," a course at a public university in Turkey, formed the
   sample of this study. The study lasted for 14 weeks. At the end of the
   study, interviews were conducted to gather data on the "effective
   dimensions of interactive learning". Additionally, computer logs of the
   students were kept and analyzed to triangulate the interview data. The
   findings of the study showed that the way instructivist and
   constructivist elements are blended, the need for metacognitive
   support, authentic learning activities, collaboration, type and source
   of motivation, individualized learning, and access to the Internet
   played important roles in students' learning in the hybrid course.

DE digitized lectures; e-lectures; flexible learning; blended learning;
   media in education
AB This study investigates the level of students' learning when using
   e-lectures to increase the flexibility of the learning experience. Two
   cohorts of students were presented with the same material in lecture
   format. The control group attended a traditional live lecture, while
   the treatment group was offered an e-lecture with the same content.
   Both groups were asked to work on specific review questions and
   encouraged to pose their own, as preparation for a
   knowledge-acquisition post-test. There were no significant differences
   in postintervention measures regarding students' level of knowledge,
   but students in the e-lecture group (lacking immediate teacher-student
   communication) employed a strongly acquisitive mode of learning, thus
   undermining teacher-student dialogue later in classroom. The results of
   this study indicate that students may learn efficiently at the
   introductory level by using e-lecturing material and they are also
   satisfied by the flexibility of the experience. However, the adoption
   of e-lectures to support flexible learning should be explored in close
   relationship to models of course re-engineering that also foster
   instructional cohesiveness, by integrating the various learning events
   as interrelated nodes of a productive learning network.

AB This article presents a quantitative study on gender differences in
   attitudes toward the usage of Information Technology (IT) related tools
   and applications. The study was conducted at Universiti Putra Malaysia,
   Malaysia, with 73 female and 29 male student teachers involved as
   participants. They were each presented with a questionnaire to relate
   their attitudes toward IT before and after undergoing a discrete IT
   course for the duration of one semester (14 weeks). The attitudes of
   the respondents were measured in terms of three dimensions, namely,
   usefulness, confidence and aversion. There were no significant
   differences between female and male student teachers when the pre- and
   post-test mean scores were compared. Both genders exhibited the same
   levels of attitudes before and after undergoing the comprehensive IT
   course. This suggests that the exposure to IT did not contribute to any
   significant gender disparity. The paired sample t- test results showed
   improved attitudes toward IT usage in both females and males after the
   exposure to IT. The biggest improvement for both females and males was
   in the aversion dimension which showed that their initial strong
   dislike toward IT was greatly reduced at the end of the course. In
   terms of confidence, female participants exhibited an enhanced
   confidence level after the course as opposed to the male participants.
   The results support the view that computer experience is gender-based
   as the increase in IT confidence over time assumed different patterns
   for females and males.

AB Earlier work at unsupervised playground computer kiosks in rural India,
   popularly called 'hole-in-the-wall', showed that children exposed to
   these kiosks learn to use computers on their own and that they are able
   to clear school examinations in computer science, without any classroom
   teaching for it. Extending this, our recent research work examines the
   possible impact on attainments in other curricular subjects, arising
   from self-directed use of these kiosks. This paper investigates the
   impact of use of the playground computer kiosk, on school examination
   results, of students in a rural school in India over a 2.5-year period
   from 2002-2004. A comparative study was conducted, of students from a
   kiosk school and a non-kiosk school, as well as of frequent and
   infrequent users of the kiosk. The study covered groups of a total of
   161 students who were aged 13-14 in 2004. Students were measured for
   differences in their intelligence, creativity potential, leadership
   potential, and frequency of kiosk use. The school results show a
   significant impact of kiosk usage on Mathematics achievement.

AB Findings from two ethnographic studies regarding teachers' uses of
   computers from 1991 and 2004 are compared to discover how teachers'
   experiences of computer have changed since the proliferation of
   computers in schools and how teachers' experiences of computers have
   remained the same. Despite the tremendous increase in availability of
   computers in schools and modest progress in teachers' computer use, a
   comparison of data demonstrates continuing token integration of
   computers by teachers. Such factors as lack of effective training, and
   need for collaboration and involvement in planning for computer use
   which inhibited teachers' computer use in 1991 continued to exist in
   2004.

AB The aim of this study is to explore student multiple representation
   skills and creativity in solving mathematical problems when supported
   by a multimedia whiteboard system. The subjects were 6(th) grade
   primary school students that were tested and selected as excellent
   students in mathematics. Twenty-one numerical and geometry problems
   were given to the students in the experiment. The learning activities
   including problem solving, peer criticizing and response improvement
   facilitated by the designed multimedia whiteboard system. The findings
   of this study are that student multiple representation skills are the
   keys to successful mathematical problem solving. Students with high
   elaboration ability can take better advantage from peer interactions
   and teacher guidance to generate more diversified ideas and solutions
   in mathematical problem solving. In contrast, students with low
   elaboration ability would have great difficulty in representation
   skills. We conclude that elaboration ability in creativity is a
   critical factor that affects student's multiple representation skills.
   The study suggests that teachers could design mathematical problem
   solving activities supported by a multimedia whiteboard system to
   improve student multiple representation skills.

ID INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB This study is a presentation of the usage of distance education
   technologies in a bid to support face to face education of tourist
   guide candidates during the training tour. The laws require tourist
   guide candidates to successfully complete their internship tour and get
   a certificate. Since the time in this internship period is limited and
   there are restricting factors such as transportation, accommodation;
   many of the tourism places couldn't be included in this internship
   period. Besides, the lack of experienced and competent guides in the
   visited places is also another negative factor reducing the quality and
   efficiency of the training. Technological support of the training of
   tourist guide candidates would effectively reduce the negativities of
   traditional education methods. Thus, benefiting from computer
   technologies and audiovisual systems during the internship of tourist
   guide candidates would result in an increase in the effectiveness and
   usefulness of the training tour and would make it possible to visit
   more places in a shorter period. This study is a presentation on how
   distance education method could be implemented and an attempt to show
   the benefits could be obtained from implementation of these methods
   along with the possible problems that are predicted to arise.

TI e-Learning: The student experience
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
ID EDUCATION
AB The paper draws on in-depth qualitative. comments from student
   evaluation of an e-learning module on an MSc in Information
   Technologies and Management, to develop a picture of their perspective
   on the experience. Questionnaires that yielded some basic quantitative
   data and a rich seam of qualitative data were administered. General
   questions on satisfaction and dissatisfaction identified the criteria
   that student used in evaluation, while specific questions of aspects of
   the module generated some insights into the student learning process.
   The criteria used by students when expressing satisfaction are: synergy
   between theory and practice; specific subject themes; discussion forums
   and other student interaction; and, other learning support. The themes
   that are associated with dissatisfaction include: robustness and
   usability of platform; access to resources (such as articles and
   books); currency of study materials; and, student work scheduling.
   Aspects of the student learning experience that should inform the
   development of e-learning include: each student engages differently;
   printing means that students use the integrated learning environment as
   a menu; discussion threads and interaction are appreciated, but
   students are unsure in making contributions; and, expectations about
   the tutor's role in e-learning are unformed.

TI Online data collection in academic research: advantages and limitations
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
ID MAIL
AB Online data collection in academic research might be replacing
   paper-and-pencil surveys or questionnaires in the near future. This
   paper discusses the advantages and limitations of online data
   collection, with particular reference to the conduct of two qualitative
   studies involving upper secondary school teachers and students in
   Iceland in 2002. Email was used for contacting the participants to ask
   them to visit a designated website in order to complete the
   questionnaire. Some problems arose with the use of an online web-based
   programme for data collection. Among them were the unreliability of the
   email address lists and the lack of willingness, particularly among
   students, to participate. The paper concludes that while online surveys
   can access large and geographically distributed populations and achieve
   quick returns, they may no longer be as universally appealing as was
   once believed. Reaching the population sample remains a problem in
   online as well as in traditional data collection.

ID CD-ROM; INTERACTIVE STORYBOOK; SKILLS; MEMORY
AB This study investigates the differences in children's comprehension and
   enjoyment of storybooks according to the medium of presentation. Two
   different storybooks were used and 132 children participated. Of these,
   51 children read an extract from The Magicians of Caprona, about half
   reading an electronic version with an online dictionary, and the rest
   reading a printed version with a separate printed dictionary. The
   remaining 81 children read an extract from The Little Prince, 26
   reading an electronic version, 26 reading the same but with narration
   and 29 reading a printed version. No dictionary was supplied with this
   storybook. The type of medium did not significantly affect the
   children's enjoyment of either storybook, and while it took them longer
   to read the electronic versions, this difference was only significant
   for The Little Prince. For both storybooks, comprehension scores were
   higher for retrieval-type questions than for inference ones. The use of
   the online dictionary in the electronic condition of The Magicians of
   Caprona was significantly greater than that for the printed dictionary
   in that condition. The provision of narration in the electronic version
   of The Little Prince led to significantly higher comprehension scores
   than when narration was absent.

AB Although the Web allows for flexible learning, research has found that
   online students tend to lack focus, willingness to participate,
   confidence, and discipline. This study thus attempts to promote
   Web-based self-regulated learning from the social cognitive
   perspective, which emphasizes the interactions among personal,
   behavioral, and environmental influences.
   This study has identified the most significant factors for personal,
   behavioral, and environmental influences in the social cognitive model
   of self-regulated learning, and also applied this model to the
   development of the NetPorts web-based learning system. NetPorts, in
   turn, allows us to empirically analyze the interactions between the
   aforementioned factors. Our Web-based findings support the social
   cognitive view of self-regulated learning: students who hold higher
   levels of motivation apply more effective strategies, and respond more
   appropriately to environmental demands, in the Web-based learning
   environment. These findings also further validate the application of
   the social cognitive model to Web-based learning through the NetPorts.

ID SCIENCE
AB The findings of two studies with students doing research with the
   Internet about topics in science are reported. The focus is on
   students' methods of text production when using external web-based
   information and their learning outcomes. In a first exploratory study,
   the computer-based text production of 45 students was analysed using
   log files. Two types of students were identified with respect to the
   ways they used information obtained from the Web: Compilers usually
   copied text from web sources into their own essays. They lacked
   adequate cognitive processing of the collected information. Authors
   created original text and scored significantly higher in posttests. A
   follow-up study with 133 students verified parts of the hypothesis that
   writing with external sources of information has epistemic effects.
   However, students with basic writing skills and little prior knowledge
   benefited most from writing tasks.

ID ORIENTING ACTIVITIES; OBJECTIVES; EXAMPLES; PROSE; QUESTIONS; FEEDBACK
AB This study investigated the effects of several elements of instruction
   (objectives, information, practice, examples and review) when they were
   combined in a systematic manner. College students enrolled in a
   computer literacy course used one of six different versions of a
   computer-based lesson delivered on the web to learn about input,
   processing, storage and output of a computer. The six versions of the
   program consisted of (1) a full version that contained information plus
   objectives, practice with feedback, examples and review, (2) a version
   without objectives, (3) one without examples, (4) one without practice,
   (5) one without review and (6) a lean version containing information
   only. Results indicated participants who used one of the four versions
   of the computer program that included practice performed significantly
   better on the posttest and had consistently more positive attitudes
   than those who did not receive practice. Implications for the
   development of computer-based instruction are explored.

TI Research apprenticeships: A report on a model graduate programme in
   instructional systems
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Graduate programmes in instructional design/educational technology are,
   by their nature, continuously being updated and improved. As a most
   recent iteration of the ever-evolving graduate experience, an
   experimental programme at Pennsylvania State University's Instructional
   Systems programme takes as its centerpiece a research apprenticeship in
   which graduate students work directly with their advisors in research
   teams as part of a credit-bearing coursework. This paper reports the
   results of an evaluation to examine the uses and the effectiveness of
   the research apprenticeship from both faculty and staff perspectives.
   The findings indicate that the course enjoyed a great degree of
   flexibility and allowed faculty to integrate a number of different
   approaches and activities into this course and to account for extensive
   mentoring of graduate students through the credit-bearing
   apprenticeship. Students indicated that the course gave them much more
   equitable access to mentoring for publications and presentations and
   opportunities to engage in scholarly activities throughout their
   apprenticeship. Suggestions for programmes seeking to employ an
   apprenticeship approach were drawn along with future research
   directions.

TI When curriculum-based, technology-enhanced field experiences and
   teacher inquiry coalesce: An opportunity for conceptual change?
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB National agencies advocate the use of field experiences to help prepare
   teachers to integrate technology in their classrooms. However,
   prospective teachers often fail to synthesise the integration of
   technology with the complexities of teaching during such experiences.
   This study suggests teacher inquiry, a strategy for helping educators
   systematically and intentionally study their own practice, provides
   important benefits for prospective teachers participating in
   curriculum-based, technology-enhanced field experiences.
   Specifically, this study explores whether or not engagement in teacher
   inquiry can promote conceptual change related to teaching with
   technology. Thirteen inquiries conducted by prospective teachers in six
   elementary schools were analysed and one instrumental case was
   identified. The case exemplifies how curriculum-based,
   technology-enhanced field experiences and teacher inquiry may coalesce
   to support conceptual change for prospective teachers. In fact, the
   marriage of curriculum-based, technology-enhanced field experiences and
   teacher inquiry embodies research-based conditions necessary for
   conceptual change.
   Teacher inquiry is widely recognised and supported in the general
   teacher education literature yet its use by prospective teachers in
   curriculum-based, technology-enhanced field experiences is novel. This
   exploratory study highlights its potential and encourages further
   research into its usefulness as a tool to prepare the next generation
   of teachers to be effective technology-using educators.

TI Laying a foundation for lifelong learning: Case studies of e-assessment
   in large 1st-year classes
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Concerns about noncompletion and the quality of the 1st-year student
   experience have been linked to recent changes in higher education such
   as modularisation, increased class sizes, greater diversity in the
   student intake and reduced resources. Improving formative assessment
   and feedback processes is seen as one way of addressing academic
   failure, of enhancing the learning experience and students' chances of
   success in the early years of study. This paper argues that if this is
   to happen, a broader perspective on the purposes of formative
   assessment and feedback is required, one that links these processes to
   the development of learner self-regulation. It then shows, through two
   case studies drawn from the Re-engineering Assessment Practices
   project, how information and communication technology might support
   formative assessment processes and the development of self-regulation
   in large 1st-year classes. Finally, the paper presents a set of
   principles for the effective design and evaluation of formative
   assessment and feedback processes.

AB Managing the pedagogical aspects of the 'computational turn' that is
   occurring within the Humanities in general and the disciplines
   associated with cognitive science and neuroscience in particular, first
   implies facing the challenge of introducing students to computation.
   This paper presents what has proven to be an efficient approach to
   bringing undergraduate Humanities students to reach insight into the
   nature of computation and its bearing on reflecting upon the mind in
   general, and the brain in particular. It is set within the context of a
   course on the topic of sensory perception featuring a laboratory
   component aimed at guiding students to develop neuronal networking
   skills. In this course, students are asked to design, test and discuss
   the neurophysiological, psychological and philosophical implications of
   the neuronal blueprints of a virtual creature's brain which they are
   challenged to 'wire' themselves in such a way as to allow it to 'see
   the world' within which they choose to place it. The insight on which
   we are reporting here is simply that a basic competence in using a
   spreadsheet application is all that is required to allow implementing
   and testing of virtual brains made of basic formal neurones, bringing
   the miracle of computer simulation within the reach of even the most
   computer-shy undergraduates. Once introduced to basic neuronal networks
   (two 90-minute laboratory sessions), two laboratory sessions are
   sufficient to bring groups of up to some 50 undergraduates to
   manipulate the basic spreadsheet operations successfully and understand
   how virtual brains consisting of basic formal neurones can be
   implemented in terms of these basic spreadsheet operations. It is the
   'flattening' to which the virtual (formal neuronal) brains are thus
   subjected, as they are turned into spreadsheets that led to coining the
   concept of a 'flatbrain spreadsheet'. The students are then challenged
   to develop and implement their very own virtual creature's flatbrain
   spreadsheets, and gently tutored into noticing the key problems out of
   which arise the great debates in cognitive science about such issues as
   consciousness, qualia, categorisation, induction, computational
   explanation and the like. Empirical evidence gathered over the course
   of the last 6 years strongly suggests that the construction of
   flatbrain spreadsheets by students does make a difference in the
   classroom.

TI Students' experiences with and preferences for using information
   technology in music learning in Shanghai's secondary schools
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CHINA
AB This study explores the centrality of information technology (IT) to
   Chinese students' experiences in music lessons. Students involved in
   this qualitative and quantitative study described the possibilities of
   using technology when learning music. From among the students of 15
   Shanghai secondary schools, 1741 responded to a written questionnaire
   and 68 took part in interviews. The students' perceptions of the use of
   IT were grouped in relation to three categories: (1) the students'
   motivation to learn music, (2) their preferred musical activities and
   (3) the musical styles preferred for classroom learning. Most students
   believed that IT could provide motivation for music learning. They used
   IT mainly in their listening activities but believed that it could also
   be helpful in learning both classical and popular musical styles. The
   findings suggest that the use of IT could extend the boundaries of
   music learning in the classroom, giving rise to a multitude of new and
   exciting possibilities. This approach to curriculum formulation is
   argued to be significant in terms of developing students' technological
   literacy and providing rich learning environments that make use of
   computer-mediated communications and the effectiveness of technology
   and teacher fidelity in implementing pedagogy.

TI Modifying the metaphor in order to improve understanding of control
   languages - the little-person becomes a cast of actors
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The instructional metaphor is an important bridge to understanding,
   particularly when students are undertaking tasks that are conceptually
   difficult and outside their previous experience. It is suggested that
   the limitations of the implicit metaphor of the procedural control
   languages are the main cause of the problems experienced with
   delivering the control topic within the Information and Communication
   Technology (ICT) curriculum. These continue to dominate classroom
   practice despite Papert warning more than 25 years ago of the
   conceptual restrictions that they place on children's thinking. It is
   also claimed that the procedural control languages do not provide an
   adequate representation of the underlying input-process-output model of
   control, and that this contributes to a systematic pattern of
   misunderstanding. Classroom trials of a graphic object-orientated
   language are related to a prior study made with the procedural control
   language Control Logo. The relatively more sophisticated mental models
   developed by students working with actor-lab are discussed in terms of
   the different underlying metaphors and the problem representation
   provided.

ID ACHIEVEMENT; SYSTEM
AB Although computers and network technology have been widely utilised to
   assist students learn, few technical supports have been developed to
   help hearing-impaired students learn in Taiwan. A significant challenge
   for teachers is to provide after-class learning care and assistance to
   hearing-impaired students that sustain their motivation to participate
   in continuous learning activities. However, lacking an effective
   communication channel, teachers cannot easily provide after-class
   learning care or instruction to sustain student motivation. This study
   developed a learning support system to provide after-class learning
   care through smart phones and the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)
   network. Student reactions identified effective strategies regarding
   student-teacher interaction while teachers utilised the wireless
   network and handheld devices to provide learning support. Questionnaire
   results demonstrated that most students and their parents considered
   student-teacher interaction and strategies through GPRS and smart
   phones effective in improving student learning at home.

ID CROSS-CULTURAL SCIENCE; TEACHING NATURE; EDUCATION; STUDENTS;
   CONCEPTIONS
AB In response to the needs of a newly democratic South Africa, a new
   education policy required science teachers to integrate Indigenous
   Knowledge Systems (IKS) with school science: Curriculum 2005 (C2005)
   was developed. The first phase of that curriculum was implemented in
   1997 with the hope that by 2005 it would have been implemented in the
   entire school system (i.e., R - 12 grades). Since then science
   educators have been making a concerted effort to develop science
   teacher education programmes compatible with the postulates of the new
   curriculum policy. As part of that effort, this study used a Practical
   Argumentation Course to equip a group of science teachers with
   knowledge and instructional skills needed to implement an integrated
   Science-IKS curriculum in their classrooms. The findings showed that,
   as a result of the course, the teachers' understanding of, and
   awareness about, the Nature of Science and IKS improved considerably.
   Similarly, the teachers made noticeable perceptual shifts from
   construing science and IKS as polar opposites to considering the two
   thought systems as compatible and complementary. The implications of
   the findings for instructional practices are highlighted in the paper.

TI Making public the private life of plants: The contribution of informal

ID STUDENTS; ANIMALS; PLACE
AB Plants are essential to life on Earth and yet are often deemed
   invisible by the human populace. Botanic gardens are an
   under-researched educational context and, as such, have occupied a
   peripheral arena in biology education discussions. This article seeks
   to readdress this absence and present the case for a more sustained use
   of informal learning environments, such as botanic gardens and homes,
   to make public the private life of plants and their role in sustaining
   life on Earth. By drawing on empirical data from a doctoral thesis and
   reviewing relevant research literature, the author argues for a renewed
   focus on botanical education within science education in both formal
   and informal contexts.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

DE science centre; informal setting; exhibition; nature of science
AB Science centres aim to present science in ways that will attract
   visitors and enhance public interest in, and knowledge of, science. But
   what images and different aspects of science are visitors confronted
   with at Nordic science centres? This study aims to explore the
   different aspects of science that are displayed and the ways in which
   these aspects constitute different images of science. In this study,
   staff members who work with the planning and creation of new
   exhibitions were asked to answer a web-based questionnaire, identifying
   the extent to which different aspects of science were displayed in
   their latest exhibition. They were also asked to voice their opinions
   on what, and to what extent, they would like to display different
   aspects in future exhibitions. This study shows that exhibitions today,
   in particular, choose to display the wonders of science, presenting
   science in a product-oriented and unproblematic way. The study also
   reveals a great discrepancy between what staff members display at their
   latest exhibitions and what they want to display in future exhibitions.
   They express a will to emphasise aspects of science on the basis of a
   societal and cultural perspective. This means that controversial
   issues, values in society, non-western science, and scientific
   processes constitute important components for future exhibitions.

ID SCHOOL GRADUATES BELIEFS; TEACHERS CONCEPTIONS; TECHNOLOGY-SOCIETY;
   KNOWLEDGE; CONTROVERSIES; PHILOSOPHY
AB In this article the authors resort to a qualitative analysis of the
   plot of science fiction stories about a group of scientists, written by
   two 11th-grade Earth and Life Science students ( aged 17), and to
   semi-structured interviews, with the double purpose of diagnosing their
   conceptions of the nature of science ( namely, as regards scientists'
   activity), and discussing the potentialities of this methodology in
   terms of research and education in science. The adopted methodology
   proved particularly effective in diagnosing the students' conceptions
   of scientists' characteristics, scientific activity, and science -
   technology - society interactions. The limited content of certain
   conceptions and a certain lack of knowledge on the part of the students
   concerning the processes and the epistemology of science highlight the
   need to pay explicit attention in science classes to the nature of
   scientific activity. Some of the ideas brought up by the students
   clearly show the influence of stereotypes and catastrophic scenarios
   depicted in films, television programs, and books, revealing media's
   limitations when divulging scientific and technological themes to the
   general public and stressing the need for the school to promote a
   critical debate about science and technology images conveyed by the
   media.

DT Article
AB The aims of this study were to evaluate reliability and validity of the
   Students' Perception of Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ), to evaluate
   students' perception on assessment, and to evaluate gender-based,
   grade-based, and ethnicity-based differences in students' perceptions.
   The validity and reliability coefficients revealed that the SPAQ was
   suitable for assessing students' perceptions on five assessment
   dimensions. The average scale-item mean values for all the scales were
   less than 3.0, which indicates a need to address these dimensions of
   assessment at classroom level. The mean value for Student Consultation
   scale was 1.96 out of 4, indicating a need for special attention in
   this area. The perceptions of students grouped on the basis of gender
   and of grade level groups were comparable, but on the basis of ethnic
   groups were statistically significantly different. Assuming these
   differences to be real, does it mean that teaching approaches will need
   to be addressed? Future research in this area is warranted.

AB This study explores the relationship, if any, between an individual's
   culturally based worldviews and conceptions of nature of science. In
   addition, the implications of this relationship ( or lack of
   relationship) for science teaching and learning are discussed.
   Participants were 54 Taiwanese prospective science teachers. Their
   conceptions of nature of science and their worldviews specific to
   humans' relationship with the natural world were assessed using two
   open-ended questionnaires in conjunction with follow-up interviews.
   Their understandings of nature of science were classified into informed
   and naive categories based upon contemporary views of these constructs
   and those stressed in international reform documents. An
   anthropocentric - naturecentric continuum emerged and is used to
   explain the participants' views about humans' relationship with Nature.
   Participants who recognized the limitations of scientific knowledge,
   and accept the idea that science involves subjective and cultural
   components, were more likely to emphasize harmony with Nature. In
   contrast, participants who possessed narrow views about the scientific
   enterprise and described science as close to technology and as of
   materialistic benefit tended to provide an anthropocentric perspective
   regarding the human - Nature relationships. The findings illustrate the
   interplay between participants' sociocultural beliefs and conceptions
   of nature of science. Concisely, people with different worldviews may
   have concurrently different views about nature of science. The study
   suggests the need for incorporating sociocultural perspectives and
   nature of science in the science curriculum.

SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES

DT Article
ID SCIENCE LITERACY; SCHOOL; IDENTITY; CHILDREN
AB This article describes data from the Community Mapping Project, a set
   of statistical activities and inquiry projects within a summer seminar
   for high school students. In designing the Community Mapping Project,
   we attempted to create conditions under which urban students themselves
   would come to recognize how mathematics is relevant to their lives and
   their communities. Using mixed methods, we analyzed the pre- and
   postassessments and final projects of 25 high school students to
   investigate what students learned from their experience. We also
   analyzed the data from video case studies to begin to understand how
   learning was organized. Our qualitative analysis revealed several
   tensions that emerged between the goals and norms of our instantiation
   of a culturally relevant pedagogy and the goals and norms of our
   mathematics pedagogy. We argue that how these tensions are navigated
   mediate what opportunity students have for learning statistics. This
   article provides some considerations and lessons learned that may help
   inform both teachers who wish to rethink their mathematics pedagogy,
   and the designers who wish to create culturally relevant curricula.

TI A taxonomy for categorizing generalizations: Generalizing actions and
   reflection generalizations
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article presents a cohesive, empirically grounded categorization
   system differentiating the types of generalizations students
   constructed when reasoning mathematically. The generalization taxonomy
   developed out of an empirical study conducted during a 3-week teaching
   experiment and a series of individual interviews. Qualitative analysis
   of data from teaching sessions with 7 seventh-graders and individual
   interviews with 7 eighth-graders resulted in a taxonomy that
   distinguishes between students' activity as they generalize, or
   generalizing actions, and students' final statements of generalization,
   or reflection generalizations. The three major generalizing action
   categories that emerged from analysis are (a) relating, in which one
   forms an association between two or more problems or objects, (b)
   searching, in which one repeats an action to locate an element of
   similarity, and (c) extending, in which one expands a pattern or
   relation into a more general structure. Reflection generalizations took
   the form of identifications or statements, definitions, and the
   influence of prior ideas or strategies. By locating generalization
   within the learner's viewpoint, the taxonomy moves beyond casting it as
   an activity at which students either fail or Succeed to allow
   researchers to identify what students see as general, and how they
   engage in the act of generalizing.

AB Although research studies in education show that use of technology can
   help student learning, its use is generally affected by certain
   barriers. In this paper, we first identify the general barriers
   typically faced by K-12 schools, both in the United States as well as
   other countries, when integrating technology into the curriculum for
   instructional purposes, namely: (a) resources, (b) institution, (c)
   subject culture, (d) attitudes and beliefs, (e) knowledge and skills,
   and (f) assessment. We then describe the strategies to overcome such
   barriers: (a) having a shared vision and technology integration plan,
   (b) overcoming the scarcity of resources, (c) changing attitudes and
   beliefs, (d) conducting professional development, and (e) reconsidering
   assessments. Finally, we identify several current knowledge gaps
   pertaining to the barriers and strategies of technology integration,
   and offer pertinent recommendations for future research.

AB During the past two decades, the popularity of computer and video games
   has prompted games to become a source of study for educational
   researchers and instructional designers investigating how various
   aspects of game design might be appropriated, borrowed, and re-purposed
   for the design of educational materials. The purpose of this paper is
   to present an analysis of how the structure in massively multiple
   online role-playing games (MMORPGs) might inform the design of
   interactive learning and game-based learning environments by looking at
   the elements which support intrinsic motivation. Specifically, this
   analysis presents (a) an overview of the two primary elements in
   MMORPGs game design: character design and narrative environment, (b) a
   discussion of intrinsic motivation in character role-playing, (c) a
   discussion of intrinsic motivational supports and cognitive support of
   the narrative structure of small quests, and (d) a discussion of how
   the narrative structure of MMORPGs might foster learning in various
   types of knowledge.

AB The CASCADE-MUCH system was designed to help teacher-designers in
   Shanghai, China with the development of instructional scenarios for
   multimedia curricula. After four rounds of prototyping, a summative
   evaluation was carried out to assess practicality. Results showed that
   the system was practical for the intended target users in Shanghai and
   also had potential for users in other contexts. The purpose of this
   article is to present the design process of the CASCADE-MUCH program
   and discuss how the evolutionary prototyping approach improved program
   quality and contributed to the designer's knowledge growth.

AB The issue of students' engagement in learning physics has generally
   been analysed in science education research using attitudes towards
   science, or motivation to learn science. However, the corresponding
   studies have their limitations. Therefore, the object of this paper is
   to present and to analyse an alternative to these theoretical
   approaches; namely the "relation to knowledge", which has been used
   more and more in the past 10 years in French-speaking educational
   research. The description and discussion of the broad outlines of this
   theory, of the associated methodology, and of the obtained results
   regarding the learning of physics will show the significance of this
   approach and its limits, as well as the perspectives that it opens.

AB A study on the effect of a structured problem-solving strategy on
   problem-solving skills and conceptual understanding of physics was
   undertaken with 189 students in 16 disadvantaged South African schools.
   This paper focuses on the development of conceptual understanding. New
   instruments, namely a solutions map and a conceptual index, are
   introduced to assess conceptual understanding demonstrated in students'
   written solutions to examination problems. The process of the
   development of conceptual understanding is then explored within the
   framework of Greeno's model of scientific problem-solving and
   reasoning. It was found that students who had been exposed to the
   structured problem-solving strategy demonstrated better conceptual
   understanding of physics and tended to adopt a conceptual approach to
   problem-solving.

ID YOUNG-CHILDREN; PERSPECTIVES
AB This paper presents a case study of a teaching intervention designed to
   enrich Year 2 students' theory of biology through the introduction of
   causal mechanisms of inheritance such as the gene and DNA. The
   researchers worked collaboratively with the classroom teacher to design
   the intervention based on the students' prior knowledge of living
   things and inheritance. Methods used to evaluate the intervention
   included comprehensive pre-instructional and post-instructional
   interviews with all students in the class. Classroom observations were
   constructed as a reflective diary. Findings indicate that meaningful
   learning occurred as a result of the intervention for many of the
   students in the class. For these students, networks of knowledge were
   developed between their understandings of living and non-living things,
   their understandings of inheritance, and concepts of the gene and DNA.

TI Science teachers' perceived benefits of an out-of-school enrichment

AB Science enrichment programmes housed outside traditional school
   settings offer unique opportunities to access and use authentic
   scientific tools and practices, especially for urban students whose
   school science experiences often lack resources. Yet opportunities to
   access these tools and practices are realized only when science
   teachers value them sufficiently to take advantage of them. This study
   examines how eight urban secondary science teachers evaluated a
   specific out-of-school science enrichment programme-a one-year
   partnership with a local university science outreach centre, which
   culminated in a half-day laboratory experience for their students.
   Teachers' perceptions were captured through interviews and surveys.
   Findings indicate that these teachers came to identify and value many
   of the potential benefits for out-of-school enrichment programmes
   reported in the literature as well as some additional ones. The
   teachers' also showed a shift over time with respect to their
   perceptions of the value of the out-of-school experience, moving from
   an initial focus on increasing test scores toward a greater
   appreciation for its impact on students' motivation and identity
   development. The study offers insight into secondary science students'
   and teachers' identity needs, and what universities can offer to
   address them.

AB Recently, the significance of learners' informal reasoning on
   socio-scientific issues has received increasing attention among science
   educators. To gain deeper insights into this important issue, an
   integrated analytic framework was developed in this study. With this
   framework, 71 Grade 10 students' informal reasoning about nuclear
   energy usage was explored qualitatively and quantitatively. It was
   found that the students in this study tended to process reasoning from
   multiple perspectives, and most of them were prone to make
   evidence-based decisions. However, less than 40% of the participants
   were able to construct rebuttals against counter-arguments. It was also
   revealed that students' abundant usage of supportive arguments did not
   guarantee for their counter-argument construction as well as rebuttal
   construction, but their usage of counter-arguments might act as
   precursors to their construction of rebuttals. In addition, learners'
   usage of multiple reasoning modes might help them propose more
   arguments and, in particular, generate more counter-arguments, which
   may act as precursors to their rebuttal construction. This study also
   showed evidence that students' scientific knowledge that might be
   mainly acquired from school science instruction could be viewed as
   important foundation for better informal reasoning and decision-making
   on socio-scientific issues.

ID HISTORY
AB The study investigated the relationship between instructional context
   (integrated and nonintegrated) that explicitly teaches about nature of
   science (NOS) and students' view of NOS across different disciplines.
   Participants were three teachers and their students, which comprised
   six classes of 89 ninth-graders and 40 10th/11th-graders. Each teacher
   taught two intact sections of the same grade level within a specific
   science discipline. The treatment for all groups involved teaching a
   5-6 week unit that included the science content and NOS. The two intact
   groups learned about same content; the only difference was the context
   of NOS instruction (integrated or non-integrated). An open-ended
   questionnaire, followed by interviews, was used to assess change in
   participants' views. Results showed improvement in students' NOS views
   regardless of whether NOS instruction was embedded within the content.
   Therefore, it was not possible to make claims about whether one
   instructional context is more effective than another in general terms.

ID CROSS-CULTURAL SCIENCE; STUDENTS; EDUCATION; CONCEPTIONS; GENETICS
AB The new South African curriculum known as Curriculum 2005 (to depict
   the year of its full implementation) requires that teachers integrate
   school science with Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS). Curriculum 2005
   has generated heated debates at various levels since its inception in
   1997. This study focuses on the effectiveness or otherwise of a
   Practical Argumentation Course (PAC) as an instructional tool for
   enhancing teachers' understanding of, and ability to implement, a
   Science-IKS curriculum. Data collected by questionnaires, video-taped
   and audio-taped interviews, and reflective essays were analysed in
   terms of a Practical Argumentation Framework developed for the purpose.
   The findings show that the PAC did enhance the teachers' understanding
   as well as increase their awareness of the need to implement a
   Science-IKS curriculum in their classrooms. Also, the PAC seemed to
   have made the teachers more sceptical of the notion that science is the
   only way of knowing or interpreting experience, or that IKS were based
   on superstitious beliefs. All the teachers recommended the need to
   include the PAC or similar courses in science teacher education
   programmes.

TI Empowerment in science curriculum development: A microdevelopmental
   approach
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID COGNITIVE-DEVELOPMENT; CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; INSTRUCTION
AB This study characterizes how learning and teaching differs as the
   responsibility for choosing curriculum goals and the strategies to
   reach those goals shifts between teacher and the students. Three
   different pedagogical approaches were used with 125 seventh-grade and
   eighth-grade students. All three curricula focus on electromagnetism,
   and were taught by two teachers in different schools over a two-week
   period. When students had control over the strategies employed to reach
   goals, their engagement stayed high. All three curricula advanced
   student understanding to some degree; however, large and significant
   gains were seen only for the pedagogy in which teachers set the
   specific learning goals and students had control over how to achieve
   them. Microdevelopment, a principle by which short-term learning
   recapitulates the stages seen in long-term developmental growth, is
   found to be a useful framework for curriculum development and for
   analyzing changes in student understanding. In general, initial
   "tinkering" activities are best followed by attempts at representing
   phenomena, only then to be followed by abstract conceptualization. On
   balance, we find that students benefit most from freedom to control the
   procedures that they generate in response to well-structured goals
   presented by the teacher.

AB This article describes the Swedish initiative of municipal technology
   centres from a gender point of view. These centres provide after-school
   technology education for children aged 6-16. By means of an
   ethnographic study, the effects of the use of single-sex groups in
   increasing the interest of girls and boys in technical activities have
   been studied at one of the centres. The importance of the gender of the
   teacher relative to the gender of the pupils is also considered. The
   results show that single-sex groups meant different things to boys and
   girls, and that the teachers' way of "doing" femininity and
   masculinity, respectively, in the different groups was of some
   importance. The results indicate that single-sex groups alone do not
   break down gender barriers. However, there are lessons to be learnt
   from a leisure-time activity that provides a different setting from
   that of single-sex science education in ordinary schooling.

TI Developmental change in notetaking during scientific inquiry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English

ID WRITING-TO-LEARN; SCIENCE; KNOWLEDGE
AB This paper addresses the development in children's and adults'
   awareness of the benefits of writing through the analysis of change in
   notetaking while engaged in scientific inquiry over 10 weeks.
   Participants were given a notebook that they could choose to use. Our
   results indicate consistent differences between the performance of
   adults versus children and also across time. First, there were clear
   differences in the number of participants who chose to take notes.
   Second, not only did adults write more notes than children, but also
   the adults' mean number of notes slightly increased over time, whereas
   children's notes actually decreased in frequency. Third, children and
   adults differed in the types of notes they took. These results are
   interpreted in terms of participants' awareness of what needs to be
   noted in a scientific task and why it needs to be noted, and they
   suggest implications for educational practice. First, because learners
   often have inaccurate representations of the task demands and their own
   future state of knowledge, they do not perceive the utility of
   notetaking. Second, because of these misperceptions, learners do not
   refer back to their notes and thereby miss feedback that would spur the
   refinement of their metacognitive (particularly metastrategic)
   knowledge and strategy use. Educators need to design opportunities for
   students to engage in activities that increase metacognitive knowledge
   of their own cognitive abilities and the demands of the task.

ID PHYSICS; EXPERTS
AB Modelling is an inherent process for the construction and use of
   science concepts that mobilize diverse specific competences. The aims
   of this work are to put forward a means of evaluating modelling
   competences that is relevant for physics teaching and science education
   research and to identify the potentials and constraints in the
   development of modelling competences. A written test, which embraces a
   wide range of modelling aspects in mechanics domain, was drawn up and
   validated, and a theoretically based evaluation methodology was
   specified. In the validation process, the test was given to 75 subjects
   distributed across seven levels of physics education. The answers were
   analysed and later cluster analysis was carried out in order to
   identify categories of answers among the diverse answers. The results
   indicate that the test identified and delimitated modelling
   competences. Some results are in agreement with those obtained through
   other research into this issue and other results better elucidate
   certain aspects of modelling. The way in which evaluation methodology
   can be used in other areas of physics is discussed, such as in research
   and in teaching. Also discussed is how the constraints and potentials
   identified in the development of modelling competences can be taken
   into account in teaching and learning sciences.

TI Explanations and teleology in chemistry education
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID ANTHROPOMORPHISM; SCIENCE; TEACHERS; BIOLOGY; MODELS
AB It has been commonly assumed that teleological explanations are
   unnecessary and have no place in the physical sciences. However, there
   are indications that teleology is fairly common in the instructional
   explanations of teachers and students in chemistry classrooms. In this
   study we explore the role and nature of teleological explanations and
   the conditions that seem to warrant their use in chemistry education.
   We also analyse the learning implications of developing explanations of
   chemical phenomena within a teleological stance. Our study is based on
   the qualitative analysis of the instructional explanations presented in
   traditional chemistry textbooks used in the United States. Our results
   indicate that teleological explanations are in fact present in these
   textbooks and help provide an explanatory reason for the occurrence of
   chemical transformations. Their use is tightly linked to the existence
   of a rule, principle, or law that governs the behaviour of a chemical
   system, and that explicitly or implicitly implies the minimisation or
   maximisation of some intrinsic property. This law or principle tends to
   provide a sense of preferred direction in the evolution of a
   transformation. Although teleological explanations seem to have
   heuristic pedagogical value in chemistry education, they may also lead
   students to develop alternative conceptions and unwarranted

TI Developing attitudes towards science measures
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCALES; ACHIEVEMENT; INSTRUMENT; INVENTORY; STUDENTS
AB In this study, we describe the development of measures used to examine
   pupils' attitudes towards science. In particular, separate measures for
   attitudes towards the following areas were developed: learning science
   in school, practical work in science, science outside of school,
   importance of science, self-concept in science, and future
   participation in science. In developing these measures, criticisms of
   previous attitude studies in science education were noted. In
   particular, care was taken over the definition of each of the attitude
   constructs, and also ensuring that each of the constructs was
   unidimensional. Following an initial piloting process, pupils aged 11 -
   14 from five secondary schools throughout England completed
   questionnaires containing the attitude measures. These questionnaires
   were completed twice by pupils in these schools, with a gap of four
   weeks between the first and second measurements. Altogether, 932 pupils
   completed the first questionnaire and 668 pupils completed the second
   one. Factor analysis carried out on the resulting data confirmed the
   unidimensionality of the separate attitude constructs. Also, it was
   found that three of the constructs - learning science in school,
   science outside of school, and future participation in science - loaded
   on one general attitude towards science factor. Further analysis showed
   that all the measures showed high internal reliability ( Cronbach's
   alpha > 0.7). A particular strength of the approach used in this study
   was that it allowed for attitude measures to be built up step-by-step,
   therefore allowing for the future consideration of other relevant
   constructs.

AB This study examined university students' knowledge of and attitudes (n
   = 378) toward biotechnology in Slovakia, a conservative country where
   the distribution of genetically engineered products are banned by law.
   We found a significant positive correlation between attitudes and the
   level of knowledge; however, although students enrolled in biology
   courses have better knowledge of biotechnology, their attitudes toward
   genetic engineering were similar than those of students who do not
   study biology. Females showed poorer knowledge and lower acceptance of
   genetically engineered products than did males. Overall, Slovakian
   students have poor knowledge and numerous misunderstandings about what
   genetic engineering means, which suggests that science curriculum with
   respect to this topic should be greatly re-evaluated and teaching
   strategies should be improved accordingly.

   EVOLUTION; BELIEF
AB Scientific and religious ways of thinking are central to an
   individual's cognitive and cultural ways of making sense of the world.
   This paper explores what foundational concepts pre-service primary
   teachers are employing when they teach science. The study measured the
   attitudes to science and religion of 92 pre-service primary teachers.
   The categories traditionally used to describe the ways individuals'
   relate science and religion were found to be inadequate when attempting
   to reflect the attitudes' of the respondents. An alternative,
   phenonomenologically based diagnostic framework was then proposed,
   constructed as a two-dimensional scale on which participant's attitude
   to science/religion was assessed as either "epistemic" or "pragmatic".
   Analysis of interviews with a representative sample of eight of the
   teachers showed that individual religio-scientific frameworks could be
   linked to distinct differences in approach to the teaching of science.
   The impact of identifying the religio-scientific framework of
   pre-service teachers on the design of future educational programmes was
   then discussed.

AB Like many institutions, Massey University has experienced growth in
   enrolments of international students. Increasing numbers of
   international students has led to frustrations for international and
   domestic students, and for staff. This paper describes an innovative
   programme designed to help with the orientation of international
   students. Domestic students (Kiwi Friends) run workshops for small
   groups of international students as part of a course on Cross-cultural
   Management. Key issues in designing the programme include the content
   of the workshops, development of the facilitation skills of Kiwi
   Friends, extending the programme to include supplementary activities
   that are attractive to international students, organisation of how
   students sign-up for the programme, and assessment of Kiwi Friends in
   ways that do not interfere with their performance as workshop
   facilitators.

TI From project supervision to advising: new conceptions of the practice
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
ID UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH; EDUCATION
AB Project work has been a common feature of undergraduate degree
   programmes for many years. While it has been named in a variety of
   ways, it typically involves students undertaking a substantial learning
   activity that is partly self-initiated and managed. More recently,
   programmes organised around the idea of work-based learning
   partnerships have emerged. These can be regarded as programmes that
   rely on significant amounts of work-based project work. This paper
   examines the implications of practices in these new programmes for
   project advising more generally. It argues that the conception of the
   role of academics in project work needs to change from one focused on
   project supervision to one of learning adviser. It identifies key
   features of this practice and discusses differences in advising from
   one context to another. It suggests that the activities in which
   academics engage need to be reappraised and that the skills and
   knowledge of those acting in the role of adviser be extended.

TI The challenges of reflection: students learning from work placements
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The importance of employability in higher education and increasing
   numbers of students working while studying led leaders on a social
   science degree to introduce work experience modules. This paper reports
   on an in-depth case study based on the analysis of staff and student
   interviews, the students' reflective assignments, and a focus group
   session with students a year after completing the module. The themes of
   reflection and linkages are discussed. Linking theory to practice was
   difficult, but when achieved, students spoke of new ways of seeing the
   social sciences. The major challenge was learning to be reflective
   about themselves as employees, while reflecting on the workplace. The
   paper concludes by emphasising the value of this mode of study for
   producing deep learning.

AB This paper reports the latest stage of a research project focused on
   developing students' understanding of assessment criteria, the
   assessment process and assessment standards. It explains the theory of
   a social-constructivist assessment process model and details one
   particular module where the authors have tried to put it into practice.
   In particular, it focuses on attempts to actively engage the students
   with feedback on their work, and the feedback process, and considers
   the evidence of whether it has been effective.

TI The 3 'C' design model for networked collaborative e-learning: a tool
   for novice designers
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
ID EXPERIENCE; MULTIMEDIA
AB This paper outlines a model for online course design aimed at the
   mainstream majority of university academics rather than at the early
   adopters of technology. It has been developed from work at Coventry
   Business School where tutors have been called upon to design online
   modules for the first time. Like many good tools, the model's key
   strength is its simplicity, but this simplicity springs from an
   extensive application of current theoretical thinking on the pedagogy
   of networked collaborative e-learning. The model forces consideration
   of some of the key features of online design, and steers the designer
   away from creating the impoverished online learning experience that can
   result from an undue emphasis on course content alone. The paper builds
   on the work of Fowler and Mayes (2000) by examining the underpinning
   theory surrounding three basic ingredients of an online learning
   experience and the crucial role played by dialogue and discussion
   within a social constructivist paradigm of learning.

TI A general framework for tracking and analysing learning processes in

SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
ID ONLINE; PATTERNS
AB This paper describes a method for analysing the learning processes that
   take place in a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL)
   environment. The approach is based on tracking the interactions between
   learners and tutors. Keeping track of meaningful events serves three
   main purposes: evaluation of the quality of the process, monitoring
   students' performance in real time and the assessment of individual
   learning performances. The results can be of benefit to course
   designers, tutors/instructors and researchers involved in collaborative
   learning experiences. The method is based on a five-dimensional model
   that includes a participative, an interactive, a social, a cognitive
   and a teaching dimension. Each dimension can be analysed through a set
   of indicators obtained by tracking course participants' behaviour
   within the learning environment. Examples of significant indicators,
   drawn from the literature and the authors' field experience, are
   discussed for each dimension. The paper also proposes a taxonomy of the
   data needed to obtain the described indicators. Finally, possible
   directions for further research are outlined.

LA English
DT Article
ID EPSS
AB This study has reviewed major design approaches for electronic
   performance support systems and identified two common problems: users'
   inability to comprehend screen-based material and poorly designed
   instructional scaffolds. This paper presents a design approach, called
   the 'Matrix-Aided Performance System' (AMPS), which enables these
   problems to be avoided. The MAPS design framework incorporates
   Ausubel's theory of advance organizers and a matrix information display
   structure. The latter is derived from a thorough analysis of the
   knowledge domains relevant to a particular user's performance
   objectives and information needs. A multidimensional information
   display is then used in order to minimize user's navigational
   confusion. The paper discusses the AMPS design framework and provides
   two working examples of its use. The effectiveness and impact of our
   design approach has been field tested; the findings, design guidelines
   and some future research suggestions are presented.

ID ATTITUDES; ACCEPTANCE; COMPUTERS; MODEL
AB Pre-registration nursing and midwifery students are under considerable
   pressure to acquire the necessary information technology (IT) skills by
   the time they embark on a professional nursing career. There is a
   multitude of research findings detailing the use of computer-based
   learning materials, IT training initiatives and how such materials are
   beneficial to learners. There is, however, relatively little in terms
   of the extent to which students are given the opportunity to use such
   skills during study periods over an extended period of time. This paper
   explores related issues by presenting the results of a study into the
   extent to which a cohort of undergraduate nursing and midwifery
   students retained and applied IT knowledge six months after the initial
   training period. The results reveal an interesting disparity between
   the skills taught and their retention and use in practice. Concerns are
   raised over the risk of such skills being forgotten by the time
   students enter professional nursing careers.

AB The study reported in this paper has explored the use of an electronic
   forum facility in order to provide support for problem-based learning
   (PBL). A Web-based course involving the use of PBL (called 'Drug and
   Nutrient Interactions') was implemented and was augmented with
   interdisciplinary expert support using electronic forums. As part of
   their PBL experiences, students interacted with their peers, the
   teacher, the facilitator and experts (a dietician, a doctor, and a
   librarian) in order to enhance their knowledge and complete a group
   project. Students' online interactions and their written reflections
   were used to identify the types of online support which contributed to
   self-directed, Web-based learning in a PBL context. The study concluded
   that both cognitive support (guidance, clarification, suggestion,
   inquiry, information) and affective support (comment, confirmation,
   reminding and encouragement) are needed in order to facilitate the
   process of learning. Overall, students were positive about this
   approach.

AB This study assessed the influence of a 3-year professional development
   program on elementary teachers' views of nature of science (NOS),
   instructional practice to promote students' appropriate NOS views, and
   the influence of participants' instruction on elementary student NOS
   views. Using the VNOS-B and associated interviews the researchers
   tracked the changes in NOS views of teacher participants throughout the
   professional development program. The teachers participated in
   explicit-reflective activities, embedded in a program that emphasized
   scientific inquiry and inquiry-based instruction, to help them improve
   their own elementary students' views of NOS. Elementary students were
   interviewed using the VNOS-D to track changes in their NOS views, using
   classroom observations to note teacher influences on student ideas.
   Analysis of the VNOS-B and VNOS-D showed that teachers and most grades
   of elementary students showed positive changes in their views of NOS.
   The teachers also improved in their science pedagogy, as evidenced by
   analysis of their teaching. Implications for teacher professional
   development programs are made. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This is a qualitative case study of a collaboration among multiple
   stakeholders in science education who came together in order to create
   environmental field trips and the surrounding classroom curriculum. The
   collaboration involves 4 major facets of science education: formal
   education at the elementary and university levels, informal education,
   and educational research. The data were collected by means of
   observation, semi-structured interviews, and written document review.
   This study examines how shared vision developed within the
   collaboration, the roles the participants played in its evolution, and
   how this process benefited both the collaboration and each individual
   collaborator. Several factors significantly affected the progress
   towards a shared vision and a successful collaboration including time,
   communication, understanding others' perspectives, dedication and
   ownership, as well as the collaborative environment. (c) 2007 Wiley

AB This study compared the relationships of self-efficacy and reasoning
   ability to achievement in introductory college biology. Based on the
   hypothesis that developing formal and postformal reasoning ability is a
   primary factor influencing self-efficacy, a significant positive
   correlation was predicted between reasoning ability and degree of
   self-efficacy to complete biological tasks. Further, reasoning ability
   was predicted to be more highly correlated with course achievement than
   self-efficacy. The study involved pre-and posttesting 459 introductory
   biology students. Both self-efficacy and reasoning ability increased
   during the semester. As predicted, self-efficacy and reasoning ability
   were positively correlated. Depending on the nature of the achievement
   measure, reasoning ability accounted for some 15 to 30 times more
   variance in achievement than self-efficacy. Also, as predicted,
   reasoning ability was a strong predictor of self-efficacy, but
   self-efficacy was not a strong predictor of reasoning ability.
   Self-efficacy estimates and achievement were higher for the concrete
   tasks than for the formal tasks and higher for the formal tasks than
   for the postformal tasks. In general, students tended to overestimate
   their abilities to carry out the concrete, formal, and postformal
   tasks. Results support the study's working hypothesis that intellectual
   development continues for some students during the college years, that
   a postformal level of intellectual development exists, and that
   reasoning ability is a primary factor influencing both self-efficacy
   and achievement. Student overestimation of their abilities may
   contribute to complacency, lack of effort, and to less than optimal
   achievement. Consequently, it may be advantageous early in the semester
   to provide students with particularly challenging tasks that "shock"
   them out of their complacency and perhaps increase their effort, their
   reasoning skills, and their achievement. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals,

AB This study asked elementary school teachers how educational policies
   affected their science instruction with a majority of English language
   learners. The study employed a questionnaire followed by focus group
   interviews with 43 third and fourth grade teachers from six elementary
   schools in a large urban school district with high populations of
   English language learners in the southeastern United States. Results
   indicate that teachers' opinions concerning all areas of policy evolved
   as the state enforced stronger measures of accountability during the
   2-year period of the study. Although relatively positive regarding
   standards, their opinions became increasingly negative regarding
   statewide assessment, and even more so toward accountability measured
   by reading, writing, and mathematics. The results suggest that it is
   important to understand how teachers perceive the influence of
   policies, particularly those relating to English language learners, as
   science accountability becomes more imminent across the states. (c)

ID SCIENCE
AB This article describes a 3-year study of school visits to four natural
   history museums and addresses the research agenda with regard to
   out-of-school learning. More specifically, the findings focus on the
   process of learning in museums. Comprehensive data collection allowed
   for an analysis of patterns of guided visits, the way the scientific
   content was conveyed to students, and the extent and types of social
   interactions thus enabled. Observations of 42 guided visits (grades
   3-11) indicates that the main visitation pattern consisted of
   guide-centered and task-oriented activity. Analysis of questions asked
   by museum guides reveals that most of these questions required mainly
   lower-order thinking skills. A common questioning pattern was to ask
   rhetorical questions as a means of carrying on the lecture. Detailed
   analysis of the scientific vocabulary used by the guides indicates that
   they used much scientific jargon, with limited explanation. There was
   only limited social mediation provided by teachers and museum guides. A
   minority of teachers were involved in the activities or in helping the
   guide to clarify or in helping the students to understand the
   explanations. The overall data indicate limited opportunities for
   meaningful learning, suggesting that the museums should shift from the
   traditional knowledge-transmission model of teaching to a more
   socioculturally contextualized model. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID REFLECTION
AB Educational games may offer a viable strategy for developing students'
   problem-solving skills. However, the state of art of educational game
   research does not provide an account for that. Thus, the aim of this
   research is to develop an empirically allocated model about
   problem-based gaming that can be utilised to design pedagogically
   meaningful games. The proposed model was evaluated through a business
   simulation game. The interviews indicated that authenticity,
   collaboration and learning by doing were found to be the most important
   characteristics of effective educational games. Results also showed
   that the proposed model describes well the problem-based gaming process
   in which the reflection phase seems to be a vital factor. The outcome
   of the reflection phase may be personal synthesis of knowledge,
   validation of hypothesis laid or a new playing strategy to be tested.
   However, because of the small sample size of this study, more research
   on the topic is recommended. Especially, ways to support reflection in
   games needs to be studied.

AB Software-engineering education programs are intended to prepare
   students for a field that involves rapidly changing conditions and
   expectations. Thus, there is always a danger that the skills and the
   knowledge provided may soon become obsolete. This paper describes
   results and draws on experiences from the implementation of a computer
   game-development course whose design addresses problems in
   software-engineering education by improving students' abilities in four
   areas: (1) problem solving; (2) the application of previously learned
   knowledge; (3) the use of independent learning; and (4) learning by
   doing. In order to better understand this course's effect on students'
   performance in a software-development project, I investigated 125
   students' performance in a 1-year senior-project course. Results of
   this study show that the students who had taken the computer
   game-development course became more successful in the senior-project
   course than the students who had not taken it.

AB For some time now, computer games have played an important role in both
   children and adults' leisure activities. While there has been much
   written on the negative aspects of computer games, it has also been
   recognised that they have potential advantages and benefits. There is
   no doubt that computer games are highly engaging and incorporate
   features that are extremely compelling. It is these highly engaging
   features of computer games that have attracted the interests of
   educationalists. The use of games-based learning has been growing for
   many years now; however, within software engineering, there is still a
   dearth of empirical evidence to support this approach. In this paper,
   we examine the literature on the use of computer games to teach
   software engineering concepts and describe a computer game we have been
   developing to teach these concepts.

TI The design of an analogical encoding tool for game-based virtual
   learning environments
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
ID CATEGORIES; INDUCTION; ACCESS
AB Game-based virtual learning environments have the potential to provide
   opportunities for engagement in authentic contexts while completing
   authentic tasks such as problem solving. However, research in
   problem-based learning indicates that scaffolding should be provided
   for learners to benefit from such learning environments. This paper
   describes the design of an anagogical encoding tool, a computer-based
   scaffold, in a game-based virtual learning environment. Research on
   analogical encoding suggests that teaching students to compare cases
   side-by-side to draw out the underlying principles improves knowledge
   acquisition and transfer. Analogical encoding aids students in
   attending to the deep underlying structures (ie, principles) of cases,
   thereby reducing the potential distraction of surface features. This
   paper intends to translate laboratory research findings on analogical
   encoding to a scaffolding tool in a game-based virtual learning
   environment.

   business case studies are described in this article specifying the
   context, the training goal, the adopted training solution and the main
   characteristics of the designed game. Some screenshots are also shown.
   Furthermore, the authors are carrying out a survey both in the business
   and the university environment to analyse how the learners perceive
   these kinds of games in terms of effectiveness, engagement, pleasure,
   usability and freedom of behaviour while playing. Some results are
   reported in this paper, and the comparison between students' and
   employees' perception is shown. The questionnaire used can be found in
   the Appendix.

TI Flow experiences of children in an interactive social game environment
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This study examines children's flow experiences in an interactive
   social game environment. A total of 33 children aged from 7 to 9 years
   participated in the study for 6 weeks. Data were collected through
   observations and interviews. In order to measure the flow experiences
   of the children, items of a flow scale were administered to the
   children through interviews. Results revealed that flow experiences
   occur more among boys than girls during gameplay. While ludology had
   more effect on the flow experiences of boys when compared with the
   narratology of computer games, narratology had more effect among girls.
   Challenge and complexity elements of games had more effect on the flow
   experiences of the children than clear feedback.

ID DESIGN; ICT
AB The research design for this study focuses on examining the core issues
   and challenges when video games are used in the classroom. For this
   purpose three naturalistic contexts in Turkey were examined in which
   educational video games were used as the basis for teaching units on
   world continents and countries, first aid, and basic computer hardware
   and peripherals, in primary, secondary and higher education contexts
   respectively. Methods employed in the data collection include observing
   lessons, taking field notes, interviewing students and teachers, saving
   online discourse data, and collecting student artifacts and
   reflections. Findings identified issues related to (1) the design of
   the video game environment, (2) school infrastructure, (3) the nature
   of learning, the role of the teacher and classroom culture, and (4)
   engagement.

TI Digital game-based learning once removed: Teaching teachers
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In the spring of 2005, the author designed and taught a graduate-level
   course on digital game-based learning primarily for teachers. Teachers
   cannot be expected to embrace digital games as a tool for learning
   unless they have a sound understanding of the potential as well as the
   limitations, and are confident in their ability to use games
   effectively to enhance learning. The course was designed as an
   introduction to digital games and gaming for instruction and learning.
   In it, students explored the theories, the possibilities,
   considerations and constraints related to the design of instructional
   games, and the use of learning and commercial entertainment games in
   classroom and out-of-class settings. The design of the course, along
   with the rationales, will be outlined and participant reaction will be
   profiled. Suggestions for future course designs are described, as well
   as key elements crucial for teacher preparation. Ultimately, the
   success of digital games as a medium for learning depends to a large
   extent on the abilities of new and practicing teachers to take full
   advantage of this medium.

AB Sex and violence in video games is a social issue that confronts us
   all, especially as many commercial games are now being introduced for
   game-based learning in schools, and as such this paper polls teenage
   players about the rules their parents and teachers may or may not have,
   and surveys the gaming community, ie, game developers to parents, to
   ascertain their views on who is responsible for the guidelines on game
   content. Although the authors do not condone excessive sexual and
   violent video games, we advocate the value in games in general and the
   'hidden value' of this genre in many areas, including game-based
   learning. The aim of this paper is to show the multidimensionality and
   complexity of the topic that often exceeds the domain of video games.

   both of which have focused on 'quality' aspects in order to create
   suitable tools that support European educators, practitioners and
   lifelong learners in selecting and assessing learning games for use in
   teaching and learning processes. Both projects Uni-Game (Game-Based
   Learning for Universities and Life Long Learning) and Sig-Glue (Special
   Interest Group for Game-Based Learning in Universities and Lifelong
   Learning) have been cofunded by the European Commission since 2002, and
   both have involved organisations from different European countries,
   backgrounds and expertises, and as a result of this work, a
   'classification of games by learning purposes' and an 'evaluation
   framework for assessing games' have been designed and placed at the
   disposal of European educators, practitioners and lifelong learners.

AB The web-based formative assessment developed in this research is named
   Formative Assessment Module of the Web-based Assessment and Test
   Analysis System (FAM-WATA). FAM-WATA is a multiple-choice web-based
   formative assessment module containing six effective strategies:
   'repeat the test', 'correct answers are not given', 'query scores',
   'ask questions', 'monitor answering history', and 'all pass and then
   reward'. This research explored the effectiveness of FAM-WATA,
   cognitive styles and e-learning, and student attitudes towards the six
   strategies of FAM-WATA. A total of 503 seventh-grade students in
   central Taiwan were valid in this research. Overall results indicated
   that students displayed a positive attitude towards the six strategies
   of FAM-WATA. In addition, results also showed that students in an
   e-learning environment equipped with FAM-WATA achieved better learning
   effectiveness, and that field independent students appeared to make
   better use of FAM-WATA strategies than field dependent students. This
   research concluded that FAM-WATA benefited student learning in an
   e-learning environment.

AB The present study investigated the effects of a self-monitoring
   strategy on web-based language learning. Both students' academic
   performance and their motivational beliefs were investigated. The
   interaction between the use of a self-monitoring strategy and the level
   of learners' English proficiency was also examined. A total of 99
   college students who were enrolled in classes for Freshmen English
   participated in this study. The experimental group was led to a web
   page with self-monitoring form for recording study time and
   environment, learning process, predicting test scores, and
   self-evaluation while the control group was not. It was found that (1)
   the self-monitoring strategy had a significant main effect on students'
   academic performance and their motivational beliefs; students who
   applied the self-monitoring strategy outperformed students who did not
   apply the self-monitoring strategy on both academic performance and
   motivational beliefs regardless of their English proficiency level; and
   (2) the influence of self-monitoring was greater on the lower English
   level students than on the higher English level students. The positive
   findings suggest that encouraging students to develop self-monitoring
   could help increase the success of online learning. Thus, applying a
   self-monitoring strategy is strongly recommended for web-based
   instruction.

AB In the present study, we reject the view that computer use can be
   studied as an isolated variable in a learning environment. Our main
   objective is to develop an instrumental tool to measure different types
   of educational computer use in the classroom. This builds on a
   comprehensive review of the literature about computer use in education.
   This review helped to construct a questionnaire to identify a typology
   of computer use in primary education. In addition, the questionnaire
   was enriched by input of experts in this field. The questionnaire was
   presented to a sample of 352 primary school teachers. The input from a
   first subsample was used to carry out an exploratory factor analysis;
   the second subsample was used to verify the identified factor structure
   via confirmatory factor analysis. A three-factor structure of computer
   use in primary education was identified: 'the use of computers as an
   information tool', 'the use of computers as a learning tool,' and
   'learning basic computer skills'. The three-factor structure was
   confirmed in the confirmatory factor analysis. The results underpin a
   number of meaningful differences in the current practice of computer
   use in primary education.

AB Computer-assisted teaching and assessment has become a regular feature
   across many areas of the curriculum in higher education courses around
   the world in recent years. This development has resulted in the
   'digital divide' between disabled students and their nondisabled peers
   regarding their participation in computer-assisted courses. However,
   there has been a long-standing practice to ensure that disabled
   students could participate in these courses with a set of disability
   adjustments that are in line with their learning modalities under the
   headings of presentation format, response format, timing, and setting
   adjustments. Additionally, there has been a set of supporting
   antidiscriminatory disability laws around the world to avoid such
   divide between disabled students and their nondisabled peers. However,
   following a successful pre cedent in Davis v. Southeastern Community
   College (1979), the opponents of disability rights have consistently
   argued that making disability adjustments for disabled students to
   participate in computer-assisted courses would undermine academic and
   professional standards and these laws have resulted in a 'culture of
   fear' among the staff. This paper challenges such myths and argues,
   based on a systematic review of four major antidiscriminatory laws,
   that universities have full academic freedom to set the academic
   standards of their computer-assisted courses despite the introduction
   of such laws and that there has been no grounds for the perceived
   culture of fear about the consequences of the participation of disabled
   students in computer-assisted courses.

AB The potential of emotional interaction between human and computer has
   recently interested researchers in human-computer interaction. The
   instructional impact of this interaction in learning environments has
   not been established, however. This study examined the impact of
   emotion and gender of a pedagogical agent as a learning companion (PAL)
   on social judgements, interest, self-efficacy, and learning. Two
   experiments investigated separately the effects of a PAL's emotional
   expression and empathetic response. Experiment 1 focused on emotional
   expression (positive vs. negative vs. neutral) and gender (male vs.
   female) with a sample of 142 male and female college students in a
   computer literacy course. Experiment 2 investigated the impact of
   empathetic response (responsive vs. non-responsive) and gender with 56
   pre-service teachers. Overall, the results yielded main and interaction
   effects of PAL emotion and gender on the dependent variables. In
   particular, the PAL's empathetic response had a positive impact on
   learner interest and self-efficacy; PAL gender had a positive impact on
   recall. The findings imply that the emotion and the gender of the
   digital learning companion could be utilized to optimize college
   students' motivation and learning.

AB This paper reports on research to investigate design features of
   asynchronous discussion systems for higher education. The research aims
   to identify features that increase the benefits of discussion systems
   and reduce the problems. The paper focuses on a major theme that
   emerged from interviews with learners and teachers: information
   overload.
   Interview findings, together with literature and system reviews, were
   used to identify four areas of possible system enhancement aimed at
   alleviating overload: branched message threading; user recommendations
   of messages; message filtering; and a personal 'clippings' area for
   useful messages. The paper discusses these enhancements and their
   evaluation in a prototype discussion system used on a UK Open
   University course.
   Data from the student evaluation indicated that students preferred
   branched threading to linear threading; they thought filtering and
   clippings were helpful in principle, although they did not use them
   very much; and they felt uncomfortable with the idea of recommending
   each others' messages. Students felt less overloaded in the second part
   of the course, which was when the system enhancements were made
   available.

AB We compared the effects of children's reading of an educational
   electronic storybook on their emergent literacy with those of being
   read the same story in its printed version by an adult. We investigated
   128 5- to 6-year-old kindergarteners; 64 children from each of two
   socio-economic status (SES) groups: low (LSES) and middle (MSES). In
   each group, children were randomly assigned to one of three subgroups.
   The two intervention groups included three book reading sessions each;
   children in one group individually read the electronic book; in the
   second group, the children were read the same printed book by an adult;
   children in the third group, which served as a control, received the
   regular kindergarten programme. Pre- and post-intervention emergent
   literacy measures included vocabulary, word recognition and
   phonological awareness. Compared with the control group, the children's
   vocabulary scores in both intervention groups improved following
   reading activity. Children from both interventions groups and both SES
   groups showed a similarly good level of story comprehension. In both
   SES groups, compared with the control group, children's phonological
   awareness and word recognition did not improve following both reading
   interventions. Implications for future research and for education are
   discussed.

AB Although animations are believed to be effective in learning and
   teaching, several studies have failed to confirm this. Nevertheless,
   animations might be more attractive and motivating. Fourth and sixth
   grade students learned the operation of a bicycle pump from graphics
   that were: (i) presented simultaneously; (ii) presented successively;
   (iii) self-paced, or (iv) animated. The presentation mode affected
   evaluation of perceived comprehensibility, interestingness, enjoyment
   and motivation, but not comprehension test score. Fourth graders who
   were low in need for cognition rated the animations as more enjoyable
   and motivating, whereas sixth graders rated self-paced graphics as more
   interesting and motivating. The evaluations of sixth graders correspond
   to results of many studies on learning. Animations are not more
   effective than equivalent static graphics in learning, and they are not
   seen as more motivating by sixth graders.

ID STUDENTS
AB There has been an increasing interest in the use of computer-mediated
   communication (CMC) in problem-based learning. One line of research has
   been to introduce synchronous, or simultaneous, communication
   attempting to create text-based digital real-time interaction. Compared
   with face-to-face (F2F) communication, CMC may be a poorer medium
   regarding coordination of the activity. Still, we are in need for more
   knowledge on the possible advantages and problems regarding such
   digital communication processes. In the present study, we compared
   activities in digital and F2F problem-based learning (PBL) regarding
   the content of the communication, turn-taking processes and the
   emergence of learning issues. The results indicate that when students
   discussed in the digital learning environment, they focused more on
   technical and organizational questions, produced relatively more
   initiatives but less responses, and produced less elaborated and
   specified learning issues than when they participated in F2F meetings.

DE cultural historical activity theory; framework for museum practice;

ID SCIENTIFIC LITERACY; KNOWLEDGE; STUDENTS; CHILDREN; STRATEGIES;

AB Although science centres and museums are important educational
   resources, school trips to these places are not often conducted in a
   manner that could maximise learning. In addressing this issue, a
   Framework for Museum Practice (FMP) is proposed, derived from the
   perspectives of Cultural Historical Activity Theory, theories of
   intrinsic motivation, and research into conceptual learning. It is
   hypothesised that this theoretically derived framework, if implemented
   by museum educators, can potentially lead to the creation of resources
   for teachers that would enable them to make better use of the learning
   opportunities afforded by school trips, and to maximise the impact on
   pupil learning, including their affective experience. This paper also
   describes how the framework was used to guide the development of
   resources to be used in conjunction with a science museum trip. The
   resources were tested by two primary school teachers and their classes,
   and the data were analysed for evidence of teacher and student
   behaviour consistent with the design principles in the FMP. Findings
   lend some empirical support for the FMP and suggest that it may offer a
   guide for the development of museum-provided resources, which would
   have the potential to improve the utilisation by teachers of informal
   science institutions and, consequently, their impact on pupil learning.

TI Gender inclusivity in secondary chemistry: A study of male and female
   participation in secondary school chemistry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Australia; gender inclusivity; secondary school chemistry
ID EDUCATION; ATTITUDES; AUSTRALIA; STUDENTS; SCIENCE; TRENDS
AB This paper gives a nuanced analysis of participation rates in secondary
   chemistry by developing the "story" behind national trends and subject
   selection patterns within an independent school located in a large
   Australian city. It supplements the documented quantitative data by
   presenting a case study where 30 Year 12 chemistry students were
   interviewed about what motivated them to enrol in secondary chemistry.
   The students' comments indicate that, despite the quantitative
   transformations that demonstrate increasing female success over the
   past few decades, chemistry is not totally gender inclusive. Secondary
   chemistry has not yet reached total gender inclusion due to the common
   gender differences that still occur in the students' motivation to
   select chemistry and the influence that gender stereotypes still have
   on students' subject selection.

TI Korean year 3 children's environmental literacy: A prerequisite for a
   Korean environmental education curriculum
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE environmental education; environmental literacy; Korea
AB The purpose of this study was to investigate Korean children's
   environmental literacy levels and the variables that affect their
   environmental literacy. An instrument, the Environment Literacy
   Instrument for Korean Children (ELIKC), was developed that measures
   four different dimensions (knowledge, attitude, behaviour, and skills)
   using 69 items and 13 demographic variables. The ELIKC was administered
   to 969 Year 3 students from large cities, medium-sized cities, and
   rural areas. The students were given 80 min to answer the questions.
   Statistical analysis was performed on each of the scales that make up
   the ELIKC and a multivariate analysis of variance was performed to
   identify the variables that affect environmental literacy. Results
   indicate that the correlation between attitude and behaviour is the
   strongest while that between knowledge and behaviour is the weakest.
   Also, it was found that gender, parents' school background, and the
   source from where students obtain environmental information affect all
   categories of environmental literacy.

AB Numerous investigations show that most school science teaching, in
   Spain and elsewhere, implicitly transmits an inductivist and very
   stereotyped view of science and conveys an unrealistic image of
   scientific work. We present some results of an investigation with
   fourth-level Spanish secondary education students (15 year olds) who
   were taught genetics through a unit based on an open problem-solving
   methodology as an investigation. Among the learning objectives were the
   modification of their view of the nature of science in relation to
   ideas about: how science is done, what a theory is, what scientists do,
   and, finally, what the relationship is between
   Science-Technology-Society. The conceptual change about the nature of
   science experienced by the students in the experimental group was not
   observed in the control group, which worked in a traditional manner.
   Also, these new concepts remained with the students over time without a
   significant backward shift.

AB This study was part of a 6-year integrated project designed to build a
   databank of students' science conceptions in Taiwan. The main purpose
   of this study was to identify the characteristics of students' mental
   models regarding acids/bases, understand their changes in mental
   models, and explore sources that might influence students in
   constructing models. The study involved 38 ninth-grade students,
   focusing on three high-achieving students as well as three
   low-achieving students who were interviewed thoroughly. The results
   show that students mainly adhered to the Phenomenon Model, the
   Character-Symbol Model, the Inference Model, and the Scientific Model.
   Also, it is possible to draw a parallel between the characteristics of
   some models and various models of acidity in the history of science.
   The results also show differences in mental models and the weights of
   sources influencing high-achieving and low-achieving students. Evidence
   for the weight of sources is not consistent with the findings reported
   in other studies. We also discuss the implications for teaching and
   curriculum design.

AB Context-based and science-teclinology-society (STS) approaches to
   teaching science in high school have become widely used over the past
   two decades. They aspire to foster more positive attitudes to science
   while, at the same time, provide a sound basis of scientific
   understanding for further study. This paper reviews the detailed
   research evidence from 17 experimental studies undertaken in eight
   different countries on the effects of context-based and STS approaches,
   drawing on the findings of two systematic reviews of the research
   literature. The review findings indicate that context-based/STS
   approaches result in improvement in attitudes to science and that the
   understanding of scientific ideas developed is comparable to that of
   conventional approaches. The approaches also result in more positive
   attitudes to science in both girls and boys and reduce the gender
   differences in attitudes. The paper also considers issues emerging from
   work in the area in relation to study design and the constraints which
   may militate against the use of experimental research designs when
   gathering evidence of impact of interventions. A fundamental constraint
   is the extent to which it is possible to make comparisons between
   existing methods and interventions when the aims are overlapping but
   also differ in significant ways. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci

SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This study of teacher effectiveness and student achievement in science
   demonstrated that effective teachers positively impact student
   learning. A general linear mixed model was used to assess change in
   student scores on the Discovery Inquiry Test as a function of time,
   race, teacher effectiveness, gender, and impact of teacher
   effectiveness in prior years, over a 3-year period. Effective teaching
   was identified through a series of classroom observations using the
   Local Systemic Change Classroom Observation Protocol (Horizon Research,
   1999). This study found that effective teaching increases student
   achievement and closes achievement gaps for all Students. Findings from
   this study provide evidence that effective teaching each year may be
   the key to eliminating achievement gaps in science. (c) 2006 Wiley

TI Direct instruction vs. discovery: The long view
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID INQUIRY; VARIABLES; WORK
AB D. Klahr and M. Nigam (2004) make a case for the superiority of direct
   instruction over discovery learning in students' mastery of the
   control-of-variables strategy central to the scientific method. In the
   present work, we examine acquisition of this strategy among students of
   the same age as those studied by Klahr and Nigam, as well as follow
   central features of their design in directly comparing the two methods.
   In contrast to their design, however, we follow progress over ail
   extended time period and a range of equivalent tasks. Three groups of
   15 fourth-grade students, of diverse socioeconomic background, were
   compared. One group engaged in 12 sessions over 10 weeks working on
   problems that required the control-of-variables strategy for effective
   solution. Another group engaged in the same activity, preceded by a
   session involving direct instruction on the control-of-variables
   strategy. A third group received only the initial direct instruction,
   without subsequent engagement and practice. In this longer term
   framework, direct instruction appears to be neither a necessary nor
   sufficient condition for robust acquisition or for maintenance over
   time. The patterns of attainment observed here point instead to a
   gradual and extended process of acquisition and consolidation. (c) 2006

TI Modeling as a teaching learning process for understanding materials: A
   case study in primary education
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE-EDUCATION; STUDENTS; MATTER; KNOWLEDGE; ROOT
AB Modeling is being used in teaching learning science in a number of
   ways. It will be considered here as a process whereby children of
   primary school age exercise their capacity of organizing recognizable
   and manageable forms during their understanding of complex
   phenomenologies. The aim of this work is to characterize this process
   in relation to the modeling of properties of and changes in materials.
   The data are discussed by establishing relationships between the
   modeling process with three different aspects: the specialized
   scientific knowledge, the physical manipulation of phenomena, and the
   interaction among those participating in the class. The results show
   how 7-8-year-old students generate a modeling process that leads them
   to explain the behavior of different materials by using a "model of
   parts" created ad hoc. This model, built up from some kind of a
   discrete vision of the material, proves to be coherent for children of
   this age and evolves by relating the visible continuum with an imagined
   discontinuum. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 91:398-418, 2007

AB Researchers are becoming aware of the influence Of Students'
   presuppositions in directing their construction of science concepts.
   When these are entrenched and drastically nonscientific, they
   predispose the children to alternative explanatory frameworks that are
   inhibiting, especially in a knowledge domain such as genetics. In this
   study, we identified Such nonscientific presuppositions among 17- to
   18-year-old secondary school students from the Igbo community of
   Southeastern Nigeria. We designed a research-based instructional model
   to address these presuppositions. The relationship between the levels
   of nonscientific presuppositions held by students and their achievement
   in genetics was assessed. Finally, the effect of the instructional
   model on students' relinquishing these nonscientific presuppositions
   and on their achievement was determined relative to a comparison group.
   It was found that this group of students had nonscientific
   presuppositions that they used in explaining genetic phenomena, and
   that the present instructional model aided the students in
   relinquishing these nonscientific presuppositions to a great extent. We
   conclude that a conceptual change model that addresses explicitly
   nonscientific presuppositions will lead to an increased understanding
   of science concepts. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed

AB The article grapples with the question of how much curriculum change is
   appropriate in a given context and in a given time frame. How can a
   balance be struck between stagnation, on the one hand, and the
   promotion of unrealistic innovation on the other? In answer to this
   dilemma, the concept of a zone of feasible innovation (ZFI) is proposed
   and explored, drawing on the literature of school development, teacher
   professional development, and of developmental psychology, the work of
   Vygotsky in particular. A series of procedures are suggested to help
   define the nature and scope of a ZFI in any given situation. Finally,
   vignettes from case studies of innovation in science education are
   evoked to provide real-life counterpoints to the theoretical constructs
   of the literature. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 91:439-460,

TI Evolution of the conceptions of a secondary education biology teacher:

AB We describe a longitudinal study of a secondary education biology
   teacher at two moments in her career (1993-2002), determining the
   changes in her conceptions of the nature of science and its teaching
   and learning, and the factors that favored or hindered such changes.
   The changes were analyzed Using cognitive maps, constructed on the
   basis of the Inventory of Teachers' Pedagogical & Scientific Beliefs
   (INPECIP) questionnaire, designed and validated by R, Porlan, A.
   Rivero, and R. Martin del Pozo (1997), and a semistructured interview.
   The results showed the process of change in conceptions to be complex
   and gradual, with different conceptions being out of phase with each
   other. During her first 4 years of teaching, until 1993, her
   conceptions of science teaching and learning began to evolve front a
   teacher and content-centered model to one that was more student
   centered. The catalyst of the change in her initial conceptions of
   teaching and learning was her becoming aware of the students'
   alternative ideas. Her empiricist conception of the nature of science,
   however, remained practically unaltered during these first 4 years.
   This conception began to shift slowly toward less dogmatic and more
   up-to-date positions as a consequence of her changing view of
   teaching-learning, and by 2002, there was again coherence between her
   scientific thinking and her ideas on science teaching and learning. (c)

ID PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; CLASSROOM CULTURE; BELIEFS; EDUCATION; REFORM
AB Two elementary certified middle school science teachers are studied for
   changes in practical knowledge supporting the implementation of
   kit-based inquiry as part of a schoolwide reform effort. Emphasis is
   placed on studying how these two pilot teachers enact guided inquiry
   within their unique pedagogical and curricular interests, and what
   adaptations they make in their use of Science and Technology for
   Children (TM) and Science and Technology Concepts for Middle School
   (TM) curriculum. Case study results support the notion that reform is
   complex and personal, and teachers as professionals need collective and
   individual support in the classroom as they make incremental changes in
   practice toward becoming inquiry-oriented teachers. (c) 2007 Wiley

AB This study examines four months of online discourse of 22 Grade 4
   students engaged in efforts to advance their understanding of optics.
   Their work is part of a school-wide knowledge building initiative, the
   essence of which is giving students collective responsibility for idea
   improvement. This goal is supported by software-Knowledge
   Forum-designed to provide a public and collaborative space for
   continual improvement of ideas. A new analytic tool-inquiry threads-was
   developed to analyze the discourse used by these students as they
   worked in this environment. Data analyses focus on four knowledge
   building principles: idea improvement; real ideas, authentic problems
   (involving concrete/empirical and abstract/conceptual artifacts);
   community knowledge (knowledge constructed for the benefit of the
   community as a whole); and constructive use of authoritative sources.
   Results indicate that these young students generated theories and
   explanation-seeking questions, designed experiments to produce
   real-world empirical data to support their theories, located and
   introduced expert resources, revised ideas, and responded to problems
   and ideas that emerged as community knowledge evolved. Advances were
   reflected in progress in refining ideas and evidence of growth of
   knowledge for the community as a whole. Design strategies and
   challenges for collective idea improvement are discussed.

AB This paper posits that authenticity is an aspect of both the context
   and the process of learning. These two aspects cannot be seen in
   isolation and must be analyzed as one unity. We refer to this coupling
   relationship as the context-process authenticity. Existing learning and
   instructional approaches associated with authenticity, such as
   simulations, participation, and co-evolution privilege the authenticity
   of professional practices and do not adequately tackle the issue of the
   transitions across contexts. To avoid demeaning the authenticity of
   schools, we recommend other approaches, which emphasize the identity
   enculturation aspect in diverse communities. Furthermore, we argue for
   a context-process authenticity continuum. This continuum encompasses
   both school and professional communities and the context-process
   authenticity coupling. Implications are discussed with respect to the
   proposed context-process authenticity continuum.

AB Collaborating closely with a tenth-grade science teacher, we designed a
   Web-Based Learning Environment (Web-LE) to improve the students'
   motivation to learn science. Factors believed to enhance intrinsic
   motivation (challenge, control, curiosity, and fantasy) were integrated
   into the instructional design of the Web-based learning tool. The
   Web-LE was implemented in the teacher's tenth-grade classroom as a
   three-day student-centered learning activity. Data collection methods
   included individual student interviews, teacher interviews, motivation
   questionnaires, and observations. This study revealed multiple forms of
   evidence that the Web-LE and the associated learning activity improved
   students' motivation. This study illustrates the benefits of
   educational researchers working closely with teachers using
   design-based research methods to successfully solve instructional
   problems and identify reusable design principles. Design principles for
   the integration of intrinsic motivation factors into the development of
   similar Web-LEs are presented as well as directions for future research.

AB Inscriptions are central to the practice of science. Previous studies
   showed, however, that preservice teachers even those with undergraduate
   degrees in science, generally do not spontaneously produce inscriptions
   that economically summarize large amounts of data. This study was
   designed to investigate the production of inscription while a group of
   15 graduate-level preservice science teachers engaged in a 15-week
   course of scientific observation and guided inquiry of two organisms.
   The course emphasized the production of inscriptions as a way of
   convincingly supporting claims when the students presented their
   results. With continuing emphasis on inscriptional representations, we
   observed a significant increase in the number and type of
   representations made as the course unfolded. The number of concrete,
   text-based inscriptions decreased as the number of graphs, tables and
   other sorts of complex inscriptions increased. As the students moved
   from purely observational activities to guided inquiry, they made many
   more transformations of their data into complex and abstract forms,
   such as graphs and concept maps. The participants' competencies to
   cross-reference ultimate transformations to initial research questions
   improved slightly. Our study has implications for the traditional
   methods by which preservice science teachers are taught in their
   science classes. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Prior research in both education and cognitive science has identified
   analogy making as a powerful tool for explanation as well as a
   fundamental mechanism for facilitating an individual's construction of
   knowledge. While a considerable body of research exists focusing on the
   role analogy plays in teaming science concepts, relatively little is
   known about how instruction in the use of analogies might influence the
   teaching performance of preservice teachers. The primary objective of
   this study was to investigate the relationship between pedagogical
   analogy use and pedagogical reasoning ability in a sample of preservice
   elementary teachers (PTs), a group that has been identified for their
   particular difficulties in teaching science. The study utilized a
   treatment/contrast group design in which the treatment group was
   provided instruction that guided them in the generation of analogies to
   aid in the explanation phase of teaming cycle lessons. A relationship
   between analogy use and positive indicants of teaching performance was
   observed and a case study of a low performing preservice teacher who
   drastically improved teaching performance using analogy-based pedagogy
   is presented. A notable effect on conceptual understanding of Newton's
   Third Law as a result of two brief analogy-based demonstration lessons
   was also observed. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In this research project, we investigated two beginning secondary
   science teachers' efforts to learn to teach science in ways that build
   from and celebrate the ethnic, gender, linguistic, and academic
   diversity of their students. To do so, we followed Troy and Brian from
   their preservice teacher education experiences through their first year
   of teaching 8th grade physical science at local junior high schools. We
   also conducted a follow-up observation and interview with each
   participant after he had moved past the beginning stage of survival in
   the teaching profession-once in his fourth year of public school
   science teaching. Through qualitative analysis of interviews, classroom
   observations, and teachers' written work, we identified patterns and
   explored commonalities and differences in Troy and Brian's views and
   practices tied to equity over time. In particular, we examined
   successes and challenges they encountered in learning to teach science
   for all (a) from their students, (b) from inquiry into practice, and
   (c) from participation in professional communities. In our
   implications, we suggest ways teacher educators and induction
   professionals can better support beginning teachers in learning to
   teach science to all students. In particular, we highlight the central
   roles both individual colleagues and collective school cultures play in
   aiding or impeding beginning teachers' efforts to learn from students,
   from practice, and from professional communities. (c) 2006 Wiley

AB This study examined the knowledge, beliefs and efforts of five
   prospective teachers to enact teaching science as inquiry, over the
   course of a one-year high school fieldwork experience. Data sources
   included interviews, field notes, and artifacts, as these prospective
   teachers engaged in learning how to teach science. Research questions
   included 1) What were these prospective teachers' beliefs of teaching
   science? 2) To what extent did these prospective teachers articulate
   understandings of teaching science as inquiry? 3) In what ways, if any,
   did these prospective teachers endeavor to teach science as inquiry in
   their classrooms? 4) In what ways did the mentor teachers' views of
   teaching science appear to support or constrain these prospective
   teachers' intentions and abilities to teach science as inquiry? Despite
   support from a professional development school setting, the Interns'
   teaching strategies represented an entire spectrum of practice-from
   traditional, lecture-driven lessons, to innovative, open, full-inquiry
   projects. Evidence suggests one of the critical factors influencing a
   prospective teacher's intentions and abilities to teach science as
   inquiry, is the teacher's complex set of personal beliefs about
   teaching and of science. This paper explores the methodological issues
   in examining teachers' beliefs and knowledge in actual classroom
   practice. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI The use of computer technology in university teaching and learning: a
   critical perspective
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING

DT Article
DE critical theory; ICT; Internet; higher education; university
ID HIGHER-EDUCATION; STUDENT; EXPERIENCE
AB Despite huge efforts to position information and communication
   technology (ICT) as a central tenet of university teaching and
   learning, the fact remains that many university students and faculty
   make only limited formal academic use of computer technology. Whilst
   this is usually attributed to a variety of operational deficits on the
   part of students, faculty, and universities, this paper considers the
   wider social relations underpinning the relatively modest use of
   technology in higher education. The paper explores how university use
   of computer technology is shaped into marginalized and curtailed
   positions by a variety of actors. From the 'writing' of ICT at a
   national policy level through to the marginalization of ICT within the
   lived 'student experience', a consistent theme emerges where computer
   technology use is constructed in limited, linear, and rigid terms far
   removed from the creative, productive, and empowering uses which are
   often celebrated by educational technologists. In the light of such
   constraints, the paper considers how these dominant constructions of a
   peripheral and limited use of ICT maybe challenged by the higher
   education community. In particular, it concludes by reflecting on
   current critical thinking about how educational technologists can
   foster a more expansive and empowered use of computer technology within
   university settings.

AB In this study, constraint-based argumentation scaffolding was proposed
   to facilitate online argumentation performance and ill-structured
   problem solving during online discussions. In addition, epistemological
   beliefs were presumed to play a role in solving ill-structured
   diagnosis-solution problems. Constraint-based discussion boards were
   implemented to scaffold pre-service teachers' online discussions about
   behaviour management (diagnosis-solution) problems. The scaffolded
   discussion group generated more evidence notes and also generated more
   hypothesis messages and hypothesis testing messages as well as problem
   space construction messages. There was a relationship between
   epistemological beliefs and ill-structured problem solving. Simple
   knowledge, omniscient authority, and fixed ability significantly
   predicted problem-solving performance. A significant negative
   relationship between simple knowledge and individual problem-solving
   performance was found. This implies that individuals who believe in
   simple knowledge may be less inclined to explore more solution
   alternatives. However, contrary to prediction, omniscient authority and
   fixed ability beliefs were positively associated with problem-solving
   processes.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate value of combining Real
   Experimentation (RE) with Virtual Experimentation (VE) with respect to
   changes in students' conceptual understanding of electric circuits. To
   achieve this, a pre-post comparison study design was used that involved
   88 undergraduate students. The participants were randomly assigned to
   an experimental (45 students) and a control group (43 students). Each
   group attended a one semester course in physics for preservice
   elementary school teachers. Both groups used the same inquiry-based
   curriculum materials. Participants in the control group used RE to
   conduct the study's experiments, whereas, participants in the
   experimental group used RE in the first part of the curriculum and VE
   in another part. Conceptual tests were administered to assess students'
   understanding of electric circuits before, during and after the
   teaching intervention. Results indicated that the combination of RE and
   VE enhanced students' conceptual understanding more than the use of RE
   alone. A further analysis showed that differences between groups on
   that part of the curriculum in which the experimental group used VE and
   the control group RE, in favour of VE.

AB A low level of computer literacy has often been hypothesized as
   constituting a disadvantage in knowledge acquisition. However, within
   the field of computer-supported inquiry learning systematic
   investigations of these purported relations have not been conducted.
   This classroom study investigates the role of computer literacy
   (procedural computer-related knowledge, self-confidence in using the
   computer, and familiarity with computers) as a learning prerequisite
   for knowledge acquisition, and analyses the learners' patterns of media
   use as processes that might explain this role. Thirty-seven students
   from two final classes of a secondary school worked in pairs on the
   project 'How far does light go?' in the Web-based Inquiry Science
   Environment. Findings did indicate significant relations of neither
   procedural computer-related knowledge nor self-confidence in using the
   computer to knowledge acquisition. However, students with greater
   familiarity with computers acquired significantly less knowledge. In
   the light of the patterns of media use, these findings might be
   explained by different navigation styles adopted by students with high
   and low familiarity with computers: students with high familiarity with
   computers exhibit more shallow processing strategies ('browsing') which
   are less functional for learning.

ID SCIENCE
AB This study investigated acquisition and transfer of the modeling
   ability of fifth graders in various domains. Teaching interventions
   concentrated on the topic of marine ecosystems either through a
   modeling-based approach or a worksheet-based approach. A
   quasi-experimental (pre-post comparison study) design was used. The
   control group (n = 17) received a traditional worksheet-based
   instruction about ecosystems, whereas the experimental group (n = 16)
   received an instruction which was based on Stagecast Creator, an
   object-oriented programming tool, and a set of modeling-based
   curriculum materials. Paper-and-pencil tests were used both before and
   after the study to evaluate students' development of specific modeling
   skills. The data analysis followed both qualitative and quantitative
   methods. The findings of the present study indicate that (i) the
   development of modeling ability was effectively enhanced through the
   modeling-based approach, since, after instruction, students were able
   to transfer those aspects to unfamiliar contexts; in contrast, the more
   traditional worksheet-based approach did not promote the development of
   the same aspects of the modeling skill; and (ii) Stagecast Creator
   enabled students to construct, test, revise and validate dynamic
   computer-based models of a marine ecosystem through building, testing
   and debugging complex rules, routines and programs for simulating
   multiple behaviours and processes of marine species.

AB This paper reports on a case study with three dyads of high school
   students (age 14 years) each collaborating on a plant growth modeling
   task in the computer-supported educational environment 'ModelsCreator'.
   Following a qualitative line of research, the present study aims at
   highlighting the ways in which the collaborating students as well as
   the facilitator who supported them are engaged in the computer-based
   modeling 'activity'. The analysis is carried out with a two-level
   analytic tool that has been derived within the theoretical framework of
   'activity theory'. Our results show that a wide range of modeling
   'operations' is activated in the context of the three major modeling
   'actions' of 'analysis', 'synthesis' and 'testing-interpreting', which
   take place in the light of the facilitator-driven 'action' of cognitive
   and technical support. Moreover, these actions are combined into
   'modeling units' of various forms which are repeated several times
   until the modeling process comes to an end. These many-fold repeats of
   the 'modeling unit' appear to shape a pattern which characterizes the
   computer-supported shared 'activity' as a whole.

AB As teachers' knowledge determines to a large extent how they respond to
   educational innovation, it is necessary for innovators to take this
   knowledge into account when implementing educational changes. This
   study aimed at identifying patterns in the content and the structure of
   science teachers' knowledge, at a point in time when they still had
   little experience in teaching a new subject, that is, Public
   Understanding of Science. We investigated three domains of teacher
   knowledge: Teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK),
   subject-matter knowledge, and general pedagogical knowledge. A
   semi-structured interview and a questionnaire were used. From the
   analysis of the data, two types of teacher knowledge emerged. One of
   the types was more integrated and more extended in terms of PCK.
   Teachers who represented this type of knowledge had developed PCK that
   connected the various programme domains of the new science subject. In
   both types, PCK was found to be consistent with general pedagogical
   knowledge. In both types, however, subject-matter knowledge was
   similar, and not directly related to the other knowledge domains.
   Implications for the implementation of the new subject are discussed.

DE creativity; investigative practical work; senior school biology
AB Creativity is recognised as a valuable human quality for personal,
   social, technological and economic reasons and many school curriculum
   documents assert that creativity can be taught. In science education it
   is often argued that it is through engagement in practical work that
   students develop their possibility thinking and problem solving
   abilities. This paper uses data generated during a four-year study of
   students engaged in open investigative practical work in senior biology
   to indicate how such engagement might foster personal and collaborative
   creativity.

TI Changing the subject: Retraining teachers to teach science
SO RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE retraining; teaching; science
AB This paper reports the experiences of teachers involved in a novel
   retraining scheme designed to meet a short-term crisis in numbers of
   teachers of physics. Teachers trained in other subject areas underwent
   an intensive six-month training in physics and were then placed in
   schools. During the first year of teaching some support for ongoing
   learning in science was provided. A study of these teachers'
   experiences found they lacked content knowledge in areas of the
   curriculum other than physics and were unprepared for the reality of
   the science classroom. Their existing classroom management skills were
   of only limited value in the new context. For those graduates who were
   supported by experienced staff in schools, the transition to science
   teaching was hard but ultimately worthwhile. For some, whose
   qualifications to teach science were never accepted by their peers,
   retraining was a bitter experience.

   Using the transcripts of staff meetings, lesson observations and the
   conversations of school administrators, the departmental community is
   examined in terms of three metaphors: subject, relationships and
   identity. In an era of a rapidly changing science teacher demographic,
   the article highlights potential differences in professional learning
   opportunities between teachers who are university educated in science
   and those without a science background. The research raises three
   issues for the science education community to address.

TI The practice of field ecology: Insights for science education
SO RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE ecology practices; sociology of science; science teaching and learning
ID SCHOOL SCIENCE; ENVIRONMENT; TECHNOLOGY
AB In the past several years a number of authors have suggested that
   science education could benefit from insights gained by research in the
   social studies of science that documents and theorises science as it is
   actually done. There currently exist two gaps in the literature. First,
   most research in science studies are concerned with the practices
   enacted in male-dominated scientific disciplines including physics and
   chemistry; there is little research concerning field ecology, where
   there are many female graduate students. Second, little work has been
   done in translating findings from science studies to science education.
   In this paper, we present findings from our own ethnographic work in
   field ecology. Our research shows that many traditional claims about
   the nature of scientific research are not consistent with how
   ecological understandings are actually constructed. These practices are
   perhaps more accessible to female students because of how the work and
   community are constructed. Field ecology may be the one science
   discipline with features that make it particularly attractive for
   enculturating a diverse student population currently not enrolling in
   science. If science educators want to teach science that reflects how
   it is actually practiced, our work has considerable implications for
   what science teachers have to do in classrooms.
   In recent years, a number of science educators have suggested that
   science education curricula could be enriched by drawing inspiration
   from studies of scientists and science (e.g., Roth & McGinn, 1998). To
   provide insights for science education, they focused on aspects of the
   social studies of science including: methods used to investigate the
   work of scientists, the practices of the scientists themselves, and the
   effects on learning when designing learning environments that are based
   on science studies (e.g., Roth, McGinn, & Bowen, 1996). A better
   understanding of the characteristics of scientific practice also
   contributes to a shift in how we view science classrooms and may
   provide for greater authenticity and inclusiveness in today's science
   classrooms (Cunningham & Helms, 1998). The purpose of this paper is to
   provide a description of typical research practices enacted in field
   ecology. These descriptions provide evidence of authentic research that
   goes against the traditional image of science. We provide several
   starting points for discussing the implications to science education
   from studies such as ours.

AB 'School Innovation in Science' represents a model, developed through
   working with more than 200 Victorian schools, to improve science
   teaching and learning. SIS works at the level of the science team and
   the teacher, providing resources to challenge and support the change
   process. Its emphasis is on strategic planning supported by a framework
   for describing effective teaching, materials for auditing practice and
   planning initiatives, and a networked support structure. Experience and
   results from the project, concerning the nature and extent of change,
   will be used to provide insight into the multidimensional nature of the
   change process and to suggest a number of principles concerning support
   for change. Arising out of this, the major elements of a School
   Innovation Model are identified, that supports a transformative agenda
   for schools more generally.

AB The theory of conceptual change is criticized because it focuses only
   on supposed underlying logical structures and rational process
   processes, and lacks attention to affective aspects as well as
   motivational constructs in students' learning science. This is a vast
   underestimation of the complexity and diversity of one's change of
   conceptions. The notion of conceptual ecology provides a context for
   understanding individuals' conceptual change learning, as it is the
   environment through which all information is interpreted. This research
   investigated how high school students' statements, made in answering
   questions, reflect selected components of their conceptual ecologies.
   Data for this study was collected from six interviews in which seven
   students took part. The data also include the science teacher's
   profiles of each student, the students' personal journals, their
   assignments, and their examinations and answers in class. The analysis
   presented will here include only those components that were represented
   in the discourse of the seven high school students who were
   interviewed. When students were asked questions, there was evidence of
   the engagement of the various components of conceptual ecologies. These
   components include: epistemological commitments, metaphysical beliefs,
   the affective domain and emotional aspects, the nature of knowledge,
   the nature of learning, the nature of conceptions, and past experience.
   Evidence from this study suggests that these components might function
   as constraints to learning. This study contributes to the field by
   expanding our knowledge of the components of high school students'
   conceptual ecologies through its definition of the categories and
   themes associated with those components. In examining across the range
   of components, the study illustrates the variety and sources of science
   conceptions within high school students' conceptual ecologies.

AB Although prior research has shown that generating explanations
   encourages students to learn new content with deeper understanding and
   to monitor their own comprehension more effectively, helping students
   learn how to explain properly remains a significant challenge. This
   study investigated the use of software agents as learning partners in
   an activity where students generated explanations about river ecosystem
   concepts.
   The results of the experiment demonstrated that software agents can
   have a positive impact as learning partners in a virtual world
   environment. It was found that the agents encouraged the use of
   explanation resources designed to help students generate more effective
   explanations. Students working with the agents generated deeper
   explanations than students who did not interact with an agent.
   Implications for the design of learning environments with agents as
   learning partners are discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Novak and Iuli [Novak, J. D. & Iuli, R. J. (199 1). The use of
   meta-cognitive tools to facilitate knowledge production. In A paper
   presented at the fourth Florida AI research symposium (FLAIRS '91),
   Pensacola Beach, FL, May, 1991.] discuss the use of Concept Maps as
   meta-cognitive tools that help people to think about thinking. This
   work describes a network-enabled meta-cognitive tool based upon
   extensions to Concept Maps that can be used to help course designers
   visualize and plan course organizations. This tool permits the user to
   create a novel type of course description based on the idea of an
   advance organizer. Course arrangements created by this method do not
   have the arbitrary linear sequences of topics typically found in
   traditional courses at the college level. The tool is part of an
   environment that is designed to foster meaningful learning and reuse of
   course design and instructional content. This paper presents a
   description of this software tool, an approach to the creation of a
   course depiction from a Concept Map, an example of a course that was
   developed iteratively using the tool, and a discussion of the ways that
   the tool fosters course and content reuse. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

ID TECHNOLOGY; EDUCATION
AB Online systems have come to be heavily used in education, particularly
   for online learning and collecting information not otherwise readily
   available. Most e-learning systems, including interactive learning
   systems, have been designed to "push" course materials to students but
   rarely to "collect" or "pull" ideas from them. The interactive
   mechanisms in proposed instructional design models, however, prevent
   many potential designers from improving course quality, even though
   some believe that the learning experience and the comments of students
   are important for enhancing course materials. As well, students could
   actually contribute to instructional design.
   This paper presents a course material enhancement process that elicits
   ideas from students by encouraging students to modify course materials.
   This process had been tested on different higher education programs,
   both graduate and undergraduate. It aims to understand which programs'
   students have a higher willingness to participate in this work and if
   they can benefit from this process. To facilitate this research, an
   asynchronous interaction system, teacher digital assistant (TDA), was
   designed for teachers to receive responses, recommendations, and
   modified materials from students at any time. The major advantage of
   this process is that it could embed students' thoughts into the course
   material to improve the curriculum, which can benefit future students.

ID MATHEMATICS
AB Computer-assisted instruction systems have been broadly applied to help
   students solve math word problem. The majority of such systems, which
   are based on an instructor-initiating instruction strategy, provide
   pre-designed problems for the learners. When learners are asked to
   solve a word problem, the system will instruct the learners what to do.
   However, systems employing an instructor-initiating instruction
   strategy offer little help to advanced learners or to learners
   encountering problems that are not in the predesigned database.
   Therefore, in this study, a learner-initiating instruction model
   (LIM-G) is proposed to help learners' comprehension of geometry word
   problems. Geometry word problems are math word problems involving
   geometric concepts. Many researches indicate that learners encounter
   difficulties while comprehending math word problems. In this model, a
   learner can seek help with any geometry word problem he is interested
   in. Based on a learner-initiating instruction strategy, LIM-G first
   comprehends the problem and then gives the learner the telegraphic and
   diagrammatic representations of the problem, which are more intuitive
   to understand. For LIM-G, the comprehension mechanism plays a critical
   role in solving word problems. For this study, a system is built based
   on LIM-G. In this system, the cognitive knowledge needed for
   comprehending geometry word problem is constructed with an
   ontology-based tool called InfoMap. Using cognitive knowledge and
   ftame-template structures, the system can extract the relevant concepts
   in geometry word problems for comprehension. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Because there is little empirical data available on how well young
   children are able to use a computer mouse, the present study examined
   their proficiency in clicking on small objects at various positions on
   the screen and their skill in moving objects over the screen, using
   drag-and-drop and click-move-click. The participants were 104 children
   from Kindergarten 2 and Grade 1. The results show that children in
   Kindergarten 2 clicked and moved slower than children in Grade 1.
   Nearly all of the children were able to click within 3 mm horizontally
   and 6 mm vertically from the centre of a 3 mm target. The findings also
   demonstrate that in educational software drag-and-drop is the most
   appropriate movement procedure as it was found to be faster than
   click-move-click and resulted in fewer interaction errors. Interesting
   differences between horizontal and vertical movements were found. It is
   concluded that young children are generally well capable of using a
   mouse to operate educational software, making this a suitable input
   device for such applications. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB In this paper, we introduce an electronic collaborative learning
   environment based on Interactive Instructors of Recreational
   Mathematics (IIRM), establishing an alternative approach for motivating
   students towards mathematics. The IIRM are educational software
   components, specializing in mathematical concepts, presented through
   recreational mathematics, conceived as interactive, recreationoriented
   learning objects, integrated within the environment. We present the
   architecture of the learning environment which integrates communication
   services that support the interaction processes of the learning
   community, through instant messaging, chat rooms, and multi-player math
   games. Through the environment's interface of their personal workspace,
   students have access to several easy-to-use mechanisms that allows them
   to customize its content, its layout, and its appearance. At internal
   levels, the functionality of IIRM is enhanced with features supported
   by the environment infrastructure. We evaluated different aspects of
   the learning environment in three short, motivation-oriented math
   courses given to Mexican high-school students. The results indicate
   that the use of the IIRM-based electronic learning environment,
   positively affects student attitudes towards mathematics. We believe
   that this approach has the potential to promote the mathematics
   learning process, basically on its motivational aspects. (C) 2005

AB Experimental learning environments based on simulation usually require
   monitoring and adaptation to the actions the users carry out. Some
   systems provide this functionality, but they do so in a way which is
   static or cannot be applied to problem solving tasks. In response to
   this problem, we propose a method based on the use of intermediate
   languages to provide adaptation in design learning scenarios. Although
   we use some approaches which are familiar from other domains (e.g.,
   programming tutors) they are novel as regards their application to a
   very different domain and as a result we have incorporated new
   strategies. The purpose of our proposal is to provide monitoring,
   guidance and adaptive features for PlanEdit, a tool for the learning of
   integral automation methods in buildings and housing by design. This
   tool is part of a collaborative environment, called DomoSim-TPC, which
   supports distance learning of domotical design. We have carried out an
   experiment to obtain some data which confirm that our position can be
   effective for group learning of domotical design, studying the
   relationship between the quantity of model work carried out and the
   errors made. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work proposes an intelligent learning diagnosis system that
   supports a Web-based thematic learning model, which aims to cultivate
   learners' ability of knowledge integration by giving the learners the
   opportunities to select the learning topics that they are interested,
   and gain knowledge on the specific topics by surfing on the Internet to
   search related learning courseware and discussing what they have
   learned with their colleagues. Based on the log files that record the
   learners' past online learning behavior, an intelligent diagnosis
   system is used to give appropriate learning guidance to assist the
   learners in improving their study behaviors and grade online class
   participation for the instructor. The achievement of the learners'
   final reports can also be predicted by the diagnosis system accurately.
   Our experimental results reveal that the proposed learning diagnosis
   system can efficiently help learners to expand their knowledge while
   surfing in cyberspace Web-based "theme-based learning" model. (C) 2005

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Web-based learning has become an important way to enhance learning and
   teaching, offering many learning opportunities. A limitation of current
   Web-based learning is the restricted ability of students to personalize
   and annotate the learning materials. Providing personalized tools and
   analyzing some types of learning behavior, such as students'
   annotation, has attracted attention as a means to enhance Web-based
   learning. We describe a Web-based tool for creating and sharing
   annotations and investigate the effect on learning of its use with
   college students. First, an annotation tool was designed and
   implemented for the research. Second, learning support mechanisms,
   including full and group annotation sharing, were developed to promote
   students' motivation for annotation. Lastly, experiments with
   individual and shared annotation were conducted and the results show
   that the influence of annotation on learning performance becomes
   stronger with the use of sharing mechanisms. We conclude that there is
   value in further study of collaborative learning through shared
   annotation. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As teamwork becomes common in computer software learning, there is an
   increasing need to study factors contributing to team performance. To
   this pursuit, the concept of collective efficacy offers great potential
   to researchers of information systems (IS). Drawing upon social
   cognitive theory (SCT), this study examines the relationships among
   computer collective efficacy (CCE), outcome expectations and team
   performance in the context of collaborative learning. Computer
   collective efficacy is further divided into two constructs, general CCE
   and specific CCE. Their causal relationships with two other constructs,
   performance and outcome expectations, are then investigated using
   longitudinal data collected from 188 groups of students of an 18-week
   computer software course. The results indicate that a team's software
   learning performance is strongly influenced by specific CCE and outcome
   expectations, which in turn are influenced by prior performance and
   general CCE. Finally, prior performance of a group has no direct impact
   on its subsequent performance. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This paper describes an exploration of an inquiry-based learning
   approach undertaken with a group of first-year students in a large
   undergraduate class. An innovative technology support was used to
   manage the process and an exploration was undertaken to determine
   students' responses to learning based on problem-solving activities.
   The study investigated the extent to which the problem-solving approach
   was able to cater for the diverse needs and expectations of the
   students. Positive results confirmed the efficacy of the setting, and
   demonstrated students' preferences for problem types.

SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English

ID STUDENTS
AB This paper argues that the emotional state of students' contributions
   need to be addressed in an online learning community. If feelings of
   fear, anger or isolation can lead to withdrawal or conflict then the
   potential for learning is reduced and a facilitator of an online course
   needs to manage these emotions at an early stage. Therefore, a
   validated method of assessment of emotional state is required. A method
   of assessing social presence-which includes emotional aspects-is tested
   through replication, amended and validated. The process refers to
   current literature around the nature of online facilitation and
   concludes with suggestions for monitoring the development of groups'
   social presence in this medium.

ID CONTROVERSY; RESISTANCE; SCIENCE
AB This study compared 'Structured Controversy' (a semi-formal debate like
   small group activity) with a traditional open discussion format for
   medical and physical therapy students. We found that those students who
   had participated in Structured Controversy changed their personal
   opinion on the topic more than those who were in the Open Discussion
   groups. Students in the Structured Controversy group also commented
   more often that being 'forced' to explore both sides of the topic made
   a difference to their learning. We conclude that the time and effort
   invested in organizing the Structured Controversy experience for
   students is worthwhile because it encourages students to more seriously
   consider many aspects of an argument and helps promote sustained change
   of opinion.

SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB In this study, the perceived importance and manageability of teachers
   on the factors in technology integration were assessed among 407
   elementary and secondary schoolteachers. A questionnaire containing 28
   items focusing on environmental, personal, social and curricular
   factors related to technology integration was used. Two sets of data
   resources gathered from the questionnaire for obtaining teachers'
   responses toward the factors of integrating technology into classrooms
   include: (1) the importance rating for each factor, and (2) the
   manageability of each item. Factor analysis was first conducted to test
   the reliability of the questionnaire. From the analysis, four items
   were dropped and 24 items were selected and regrouped. Cramer's V
   analyses among the selected 24 items revealed that teachers' perceived
   importance ratings were related with their manageability in some of the
   factors for integrating computers into classrooms. Relationships
   between teachers' use of computers and their perceived importance among
   the four main factors were also reported.

   three elements of it are elaborated: assessment tasks as learning
   tasks; student involvement in assessment as peer-or self-evaluators;
   and feedback as feedforward. I also indicate how learning-oriented
   assessment was promoted at the institutional level through a reflective
   analysis of a major funded project. Implications for practice are
   discussed through a focus on how learning-oriented assessment can be

AB This article is based on the findings of recent research into the
   experiences of new lecturers at the University of Brighton, UK.
   Although we initially gathered data for internal purposes, we now know
   that the issues raised by our project are not unique to Brighton. We
   therefore wish to share our results with a wider audience, in order to
   raise awareness of the needs of new university lecturers and to improve
   the support they are offered as they develop into their roles. We
   present qualitative data on the experiences of 17 new lecturers at
   Brighton, focusing particularly on the following themes: induction,
   teaching, interactions with students, relationships with colleagues,
   and opportunities for research. Our discussion particularly highlights
   the importance of induction in properly preparing new lecturers and
   providing vital information and support. We set our project within the
   wider higher education context, both UK and international, and within
   recent literature on new lecturers' experiences.

AB A two-year project researching reaction to a new approach to
   postgraduate, on-campus teaching and learning, the Integrated Learning
   System (ILS) is described. ILS was intended to partly replace
   traditional lectures with study guides and to make seminars and
   tutorials more interactive in order to promote different ways of
   learning and teaching. Questionnaires and interviews were used to
   collect data over a two-year cycle. The implications of the findings
   are discussed in terms of student approaches to learning, developing
   active learning and changed faculty teaching behaviours and
   understanding. Change, desired from one perspective, is highlighted as
   a catalyst for a wider re-examination of teaching practice. The
   influence of student expectation and prior experience on current
   learning behaviour is raised.

AB The conceptual framework is alluded to in most serious texts on
   research, described in some and fully explained in few. However,
   examiners of doctoral theses devote considerable attention to exploring
   its function within social science doctoral vivas. A literature survey
   explores how the conceptual framework is itself conceptualised and
   explained. Drawing upon experience of conducting programmes for
   doctoral candidates and supervisors, field-tested models illustrate how
   conceptual frameworks may be devised and used.

SO SCIENCE EDUCATION

AB This paper explores both the obstacles and the possibilities for
   students developing identities associated with science by engaging in
   solidarity-building classroom interactions. Data come from ethnographic
   research conducted in a diverse eighth-grade urban magnet school
   classroom in which the teacher taught out of field for part of the
   year. Contrary to expectations, more students participated and reported
   enjoying science when the teacher was out of field. Analysis of
   classroom interactions indicated that while in field, the teacher
   primarily engaged in "front stage" performances that hid her struggles
   with the material and accentuated students' views of science as an
   elite status group. The types of solidarity that developed among
   students often did not involve science language and sometimes involved
   students rejecting peers' claims to membership. However, when out of
   field, the teacher allowed students into her "backstage," where her
   struggles and learning processes were more explicit. These practices
   lessened the social distance between teacher and students, and reduced
   the risks of using science language, thereby encouraging solidarity and
   group membership. This study provides insights into some of the ways
   that teachers, particularly those in urban settings characterized by
   diversity, might be more successful at facilitating identity formation
   and learning in science. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Research about the relationship between teachers' scientific
   epistemological views (SEVs) and science instruction is often an
   important issue for many science educators. This study, by collecting
   research data from four Taiwanese science teachers, their students, and
   classroom observations, was carried out to examine the coherences
   between teachers' SEVs and their (1) teaching beliefs, (2)
   instructional practices, (3) students' SEVs, and (4) students'
   perceptions toward actual science learning environments. The findings
   suggested adequate coherences between teachers' SEVs and their teaching
   beliefs as well as instructional practices. The teachers with
   relatively positivist-aligned SEVs tended to draw attention to
   students' science scores in tests and allocate more instructional time
   on teacher-directed lectures, tutorial problem practices, or in-class
   examinations, implying a more passive or rote perspective about
   learning science. In contrast, teachers with constructivist-oriented
   SEVs tended to focus on student understanding and application of
   scientific concepts and they adopted more time on student inquiry
   activities or interactive discussion. These findings are quite
   consistent with the results about the coherence between teachers' SEVs
   and students' perceptions toward science learning environments,
   suggesting that the constructivist-oriented SEVs appeared to foster the
   creation of more constructivist-oriented science learning environments.
   Finally, although this study provided some evidence that teachers' SEVs
   were likely related to their students' SEVs, the teachers' SEVs and
   those of their students were not obviously coherent. (c) 2006 Wiley

AB In this article, the Greek primary school teachers' understanding of
   three current environmental issues (acid rain, the ozone layer
   depletion, and the greenhouse effect) as well as the emerging images of
   nature were examined. The study revealed that teachers held several
   environmental knowledge gaps and misconceptions about the three
   phenomena. Using the media as major environmental information sources,
   in which environmental issues are constructed as environmental risks,
   teachers are being environmentally educated in lay and not in
   scientific terms. Moreover, the image of nature emerging from their
   ideas about the three environmental issues is that of the romantic
   archetype, which prevails in postindustrial societies. Such a view,
   though, gives a conceptualization of nature as balance, under which the
   greenhouse effect and acid rain are seen as exclusively human-induced
   "disturbances." (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID SCIENCE MUSEUM; VISITORS; TIME
AB Auditory forms of nonpersonal communication have rarely been evaluated
   in informal settings like parks and museums. This study evaluated the
   effect of an interpretive audio tour on visitor knowledge and social
   behavior at Carlsbad Caverns National Park. A cross-sectional
   pretest/posttest quasi-experimental design compared the responses of
   audio tour users (n = 123) and nonusers (n = 131) on several knowledge
   questions. Observations (n = 700) conducted at seven sites within the
   caverns documented sign reading, time spent listening to the audio,
   within group conversation, and other social behaviors for a different
   sample of visitors. Pretested tour users and nonusers did not differ in
   visitor characteristics, knowledge, or attitude variables, suggesting
   the two populations were similar. On a 12-item knowledge quiz, tour
   users' scores increased from 5.7 to 10.3, and nonusers' scores
   increased from 6.2 to 8.4. Most visitors were able to identify some of
   the park's major messages when presented with a multiple-choice
   question, but more audio users than nonusers identified resource
   preservation as a primary message in an open-ended question. Based on
   observations, audio tour users and nonusers did not differ
   substantially in their interactions with other members of their group
   or in their reading of interpretive signs in the cave. Audio tour users
   had positive reactions to the tour, and these reactions, coupled with
   the positive teaming outcomes and negligible effects on social
   interaction, suggest that audio tours can be an effective communication
   medium in informal educational settings. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals,

ID CLASSROOM; KNOWLEDGE
AB Museum educators have a longstanding presence in museums and play a
   significant role in the institutions' educational agenda. However,
   research on field trips to science museums has predominantly explored
   teachers' and students' perspectives with little acknowledgment of the
   museum educators who develop and implement the educational programs the
   students experience. This study sought to describe instruction
   undertaken in, and goals driving, science museums' lessons through
   observations of museum educators followed by conversations with them
   immediately afterwards. Findings showed the ways in which educators
   adapted their preplanned lessons to the students' interests, needs, and
   understanding by manipulating the sequence and timing. The data
   revealed that, contrary to depictions in the research literature of
   teaching in museums as didactic and lecture oriented, there was
   creativity, complexity, and skills involved in teaching science in
   museums. Finally, the educators' teaching actions were predominantly
   influenced by their affective goals to nurture interests in science and
   learning. Although their lessons were ephemeral experiences, these
   educators operated from a perspective, which regarded a school field
   trip to the science museum, not as a one-time event, but as part of a
   continuum of visiting such institutions well beyond school and
   childhood. These findings have implications for the pedagogical
   practices employed by museum educators, and the relationship between
   teachers and educators during school field trips, which are discussed.

TI Predators of knowledge construction: Interpreting students'
   metacognition in an amusement park physics program
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS; SCIENCE; SCHOOL; CLASSROOM; MUSEUMS
AB It is recognized widely that learning is a dynamic and idiosyncratic
   process of construction and reconstruction of concepts in response to
   new experiences. It is influenced by the learner's prior knowledge,
   motivation, and sociocultural context. This study investigated how year
   11 and 12 physics students' metacognition influences the development of
   their conceptual understandings of kinematics. An interpretive case
   study approach was used to investigate students working in
   collaborative groups in the context of an amusement park physics
   program. The metacognitive character of individual learners was
   demonstrated to have a strong influence on their conceptual
   development. Moreover, the metacognitive character of individuals
   within the small group contexts investigated was a key factor
   influencing the groups' collective knowledge development. A
   coyote-rabbit metaphor was developed to interpret the resilience and
   weaknesses of individual and group knowledge construction processes,
   and elucidates new theoretical understandings regarding metacognition
   and its influence on knowledge construction. (c) 2006 Wiley

TI Beyond the "decorated landscapes" of educational reform: Toward
   landscapes of pluralism in science education
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CULTURE; PLACE
AB Perhaps, we are at the fork in the road when it is imperative that we
   consider whether the pursuit of pluralism in science education is a
   worthwhile endeavor in light of recent educational reforms that seem to
   decorate the true aim of education. The "decorated landscapes" of
   educational reform concentrate on economic growth and do little to
   promote the conservation of Earth's natural environments that sustain
   life itself. Here we renew a discussion of a 300-year pursuit in the
   United States toward educational landscapes that contribute to
   students' lives. We connect with scholars who have pursued the
   pluralistic landscapes of culture in an attempt to make education more
   authentic and democratic and with scholars who have pursued an
   education for the conservation of the Earth's natural environments. We
   argue that these two educational domains are and necessarily should be
   reflective, reliant, and reciprocal of each other if we wish to truly
   engage students in scientific literacy-the authentic, relevant, and
   meaningful science education experiences that contribute a person's
   existence. Finally, we offer recommendations which aim to focus on the
   many meaningful landscapes that contribute to pluralistic life in
   science education. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In this article, we discuss several aspects of the national project,
   the National Science Concept Learning Study, designed to assess
   elementary, middle, and secondary students' conceptual understanding in
   science. After a short introduction to provide some history of the
   project, we describe the processes used in the integrative study, the
   participants in the research, the involvement of about 30 senior
   researchers and 80 research assistants, and the findings from the
   national data. Although the results of Taiwanese students' conceptions
   in science are similar to those of western countries, some aspects of
   our students' performance are unique to Taiwanese culture and language.
   This article concludes with some educational implications from the
   research findings.

AB Over the past two decades, several two-tier multiple-choice diagnostic
   tests in science at a variety grade levels have been reported in the
   extant literature from several countries. This review summarises these
   studies, provides an overview of the methodology for their
   construction, presents two examples of typical items, and lists studies
   published with two-tier tests. The majority of these studies have been
   conducted with relatively small numbers of students in one school,
   college, or university, although there are exceptions. What
   distinguishes the research reported in the articles in this Special
   Issue is that the Taiwanese two-tiered tests for the National Science
   Concept Learning Study were designed to identify the scientific
   conceptions of students from large national samples using random
   sampling procedures similar to those found in studies such as Trends in
   Mathematics and Science Studies and Programme for International Student
   Assessment. The article concludes with implications for the use of
   two-tier tests for pedagogical practice and research.

AB The purpose of this 6-year study was to diagnose the chemistry
   conceptions of students at different age levels in Taiwan ( the first
   and second years), to explore the causes of their conceptions of
   different chemistry topics, including oxidation/reduction,
   batteries/electrolysis, acids/ bases, gas particles, chemical
   equilibrium, categorisation and nature of matter, and material
   science/organic compounds ( the third and fourth years), and to design
   learning activities to overcome students' conceptions in chemistry (
   the fifth and sixth years). This research, called the National Science
   Concept Learning Study, was carried out by eight principal
   investigators and coordinated by two senior researchers. The study
   piloted hundreds of students from August 2000 to March 2003. In March
   2003, a national survey was conducted. After compiling survey results,
   attention was turned to identifying the sources of student conceptions,
   looking at teacher - student interactions, everyday language, and
   representations in textbooks. This study found that, depending on their
   age level, students held various types of conceptions of chemical
   concepts. Elementary school students' responses to test items were more
   intuitive and phenomenon oriented. Junior high and senior high school
   students, although showing cognitive development, had similar
   conceptions about chemical concepts. We also found that the conceptions
   of younger students trying to learn more abstract concepts were mainly
   due to their limited cognitive development and insufficient prior
   science knowledge. However, the inappropriate use of models,
   illustrations, and definitions of new terminology in textbooks was also
   a factor. For high school students, instruction, textbooks, and
   teaching materials were the main sources of student conceptions.
   Sources such as experiments, reference books, and instruction in
   after-school programs also influenced student learning. Our
   understanding of the different aspects of student learning in chemistry
   points to the need for development of efficient teaching strategies and
   assessment tools to help students learn chemistry concepts correctly.
   In this paper, the author will report the results from the first 4
   years.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate how factors such as
   personal traits and school locations influence junior high school
   students' conceptual learning of biology. The study was carried out
   island-wide with the whole area divided into 10 districts, from which
   4,537 students were selected using stratified random sampling. A
   questionnaire on biological concepts was used to gather the data, which
   then were statistically analysed using one-way analysis of variance and
   a t-test. It was found that junior high school students in urban areas
   had clearer and better biological concepts than those of students in
   eastern Taiwan and other distant districts. Students in the ninth grade
   performed better than those in the eighth grade. No significant
   difference was observed in terms of gender. Besides, students who had
   more positive biology self-efficacy, who watched science-oriented
   television programmes, and who had stronger motivation and more
   positive attitudes towards biology learning all scored higher for their
   biological concepts. On the basis of the findings of the study, the
   authors make several suggestions for improving biology education.

AB The purpose of this 4-year research study was to develop
   paper-and-pencil tests that could be administered to a wide range of
   students in order to establish a database about students' physics
   conceptions from elementary school to high school levels in Taiwan. The
   students' misconceptions of mechanics, electricity and magnetism, heat,
   sound and wave, and optics were diagnosed. In the beginning of this
   study, we extensively reviewed the research literature on related
   conceptions. With the use of concept maps and related propositional
   statements, we also interviewed some students to find out their
   conceptual understanding of the selected key concepts. These data
   provided sufficient information about students' thoughts of several
   concepts. Through a process of developing two-tier test items, nine
   versions of physics questionnaires were obtained. More than 13,000
   students were randomly sampled in a national survey. After data
   analysis, the results indicated that students' misconceptions in
   physics such as the image formed by lenses and mirrors and the torque
   and rotational motion were consistent with their ages. However, in some
   cases, such as the current in an electric circuit, students'
   understandings of concepts did not improve with age.

AB The purpose of this study was to report the results of a nationwide
   survey of Taiwanese high schools students' understandings about
   electric circuits. The study involved two stratified random samples
   consisting of 7,145 students in Grades 8 and 9, and 2,857 students in
   Grade 11, accounting for about 2.3% of the total enrolment in the
   corresponding grades in Taiwan. Participants' responses to the two-tier
   diagnostic instrument were analysed to identify the possible
   alternative conceptions that were held by the students. The extent of
   these alternative conceptions was compared across grades, types of
   circuits, and propositional statements. Finally, the results were
   contrasted with the research literature and some pedagogical
   implications were provided.

AB Literature on science conceptions research and field investigations was
   used to probe alternative conceptions of primary school pupils.
   Theoretical studies from the literature have shown that there are many
   emphases on the physical meaning and the effects drawn by philosophers
   of science leading to the formation of new paradigms concerning science
   conceptions research. Our focus on primary school pupils' alternative
   conceptions pertaining to batteries (ACCB), in six phases, was to ( 1)
   analyse the context regarding batteries present in primary school; ( 2)
   summarize propositional statements and develop a target concept map on
   batteries; ( 3) edit protocols for interviews; ( 4) collect and analyse
   pupils' ACCB; ( 5) use the results from phases ( 1) -( 4) to construct
   a two-tier diagnostic instrument; and ( 6) submit our instrument with
   others to carry out tests in a National Science Concept Learning Study
   (NSCLS). Interview results from 21 primary school pupils show that the
   characteristics of their ACCB can be categorized into several
   conceptual models related to language, learning processes, and public
   media. From the NSCLS, two-tier test data depict the ACCB of the
   primary school pupils in Taiwan. Many alternative conceptions are
   significantly related to language and daily life in Taiwan. ACCB in
   this research can be categorized as either content free or content
   specific. Conception models based on content free and content specific
   are presented according to the properties of the ACCB. Our joint
   venture on concept formation research has been affected by the four
   temporal paradigms formed at certain prominent historical landmarks in
   science conceptions research. Our data also show a degree of general
   similarity with existing literature on science conceptions research.

AB The purpose of this study was two-fold: one aim was to investigate
   alternative conceptions of the definition of respiration held by
   aboriginal and urban junior high students in the Pingtung district, and
   the other was to determine possible causes for the formation of these
   alternative conceptions. To achieve this, a two-tier instrument
   concerning respiration was administered to 316 aboriginal and 399 urban
   seventh-grade to ninth-grade students who had previously received
   instruction in respiration. The seventh-grade and eighth-grade students
   who held alternative conceptions of specific categories were selected
   for interviews. A total of 70 aboriginal and urban students,
   respectively, were interviewed for the exploration of the sources of
   alternative conceptions. Results showed that both the aboriginal and
   urban students held common alternative conceptions. Especially,
   students in both groups have difficulty in grasping respiration as a
   chemical process rather than a physical one involving gases going into
   or out of organisms. In addition, the sources of students' significant
   alternative conceptions not only are diverse but may be interrelated.
   Furthermore, due to different living environments, the sources of these
   alternative conceptions for the two groups are somewhat different.
   Aboriginal students tend to learn knowledge in connection with natural
   phenomena or from their own experiences. However, urban students tend
   to learn knowledge in connection with common modern equipment and
   everyday appliances. In addition, the urban students were more
   impressed by the experiments as well as by advertisements, and were
   more familiar with social events. Finally, the implication for science
   teaching is also discussed.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB This study explored and documented Taiwanese students' alternative
   conceptions of animal classification. We examined the understanding of
   the animal, vertebrate and invertebrate, fish, amphibian, reptile,
   bird, and mammal concepts among elementary, junior high school and
   senior high school, and university students in a sample population of
   close to 2,000 students. Using clinical interviews, sorting tasks, and
   a two-tiered diagnostic instrument, we documented the frequencies of a
   wide range of ideas and compared our findings with those of studies in
   the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and the United States. The most
   important results indicate that for most students, the concept label
   animal refers to vertebrates, especially to common, well-known mammals
   and birds; the most common attributes used by students to define
   animals are movement and viability; many students had difficulty in
   making the distinction between vertebrates and invertebrates, and
   between reptiles and amphibians; and students tended to use external
   morphology, habitat, and movement in distinguishing between common,
   well-known vertebrates and invertebrates, and certain vertebrate
   animals pose special conceptual problems for students by virtue of
   their external morphology and habitat ( e. g., the penguin and
   octopus). We contend that insights gained from this study will provide
   useful suggestions for Taiwanese science curriculum designers, science
   teachers, and researchers involved in the new 9-year curriculum reform.

AB The purpose of this study was twofold. First, it was aimed to identify
   Turkish pre-service physics teachers' knowledge and understanding of
   the Moon, Moon phases, and other lunar phenomena. Second, the effects
   of model-based teaching on pre-service teachers' conceptions were
   examined. Conceptions were proposed as mental models in this study.
   Four different questionnaires including 22 generative, explanation, and
   factual questions were used through the study. The pre-service physics
   teachers' mental models generated in response to lunar phenomena might
   be representations of their naive knowledge as a result of their causal
   observations and experiences with the world, and their misconceptions
   as a result of inconsistencies between their naive knowledge and
   scientific knowledge. Therefore, the pre-service teachers' mental
   models were categorized based on the work by Chi and Roscoe. Some of
   the pre-service teachers' mental models shifted from flawed or
   incomplete mental models to correct mental models of the Moon and lunar
   phenomena with the facilitation of model-based teaching. The
   conclusions of the study carry implications for curriculum developers
   and teacher education.

AB Fourth-grade students' knowledge of observable moon phases and patterns
   of change, as well as conceptual understanding of the cause of moon
   phases, was investigated before and after special instruction. Pretest
   and post-test data for 48 students were used to address the research
   question related to observable moon phases and patterns of change.
   Interviews were conducted with 10 students on a post-only basis to
   provide data on understanding the cause of moon phases. The researchers
   used the constant comparative method to analyse data. Pretest results
   indicate these students had not met the expectations expressed in the
   U. S. Science Education Standards for lunar concepts. Post-test results
   reveal a very positive performance on observable moon phases and
   patterns of change, as well as the cause of moon phases. Interpretation
   and implications of these findings are provided.

TI Historical controversy as an educational tool: Evaluating elements of a
   teaching-learning sequence conducted with the text "Dialogue on the
   Ways that Vision Operates"

ID CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; SCIENCE-EDUCATION; SCHOOL SCIENCE; PHILOSOPHY;

AB This paper describes the development, use, and analysis, of an
   educational tool inspired by the history of the optical mechanism of
   vision. We investigated 12-year-old students' reasoning about vision.
   Most of them explain it as the result of something coming either from
   the object or from the eye. Moreover, some of them think that light
   penetrates the eye only when they are dazzled. Such ideas can be found
   in the ancient and medieval history of science. In particular, the
   Ancients disagreed about the direction of vision until Alhazen opened
   the way to a consensus, arguing in the 11th century that light could be
   a stimulus for the eye. Our tool, a short drama entitled "Dialogue on
   the Ways that Vision Operates", refers to those historical elements,
   especially to the controversy over the direction of vision and
   Alhazen's ideas about light. This text was integrated in a teaching
   learning sequence and experimented with six pairs of students aged 12 -
   13. The analysis of this teaching - learning sequence shows that the
   learning process can take advantage of the opportunity offered to the
   students to identify themselves with the scientists portrayed in the
   drama.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PRIOR KNOWLEDGE; CATEGORIZATION; CONCEPTIONS; SCIENCE; EXPERTISE;
   NOVICES; MODEL
AB We applied a mixed-method research design to investigate the patterns
   of reasoning used by novice undergraduate chemistry students to
   classify chemical substances as elements, compounds, or mixtures based
   on their particulate representations. We were interested in the
   identification of the representational features that students use to
   build a classification system, and in the characterization of the
   thinking processes that they follow to group substances in different
   classes. Students in our study used structural and chemical composition
   features to classify chemical substances into elements, compounds, and
   mixtures. Many of the students' classification errors resulted from
   strong mental associations between concepts ( e. g., atom - element,
   molecule - compound) or from lack of conceptual differentiation ( e.
   g., compound - mixture). Strong concept associations led novice
   students to reduce the number of relevant features used to
   differentiate between substances, while the inability to discriminate
   between two concepts ( conceptual undifferentiation) led them to pay
   too much attention to irrelevant features during the classification
   tasks. Comparisons of the responses to classification tasks of students
   with different levels of expertise in chemistry indicate that some of
   these naive patterns of reasoning may be strengthened by, rather than
   weakened by, training in the discipline.

AB Modern biotechnology will have a large impact on society and requires
   informed decision-making and critical attitudes toward biotechnology
   among the public. This study aims to explore these attitudes in
   secondary education. For this purpose, a questionnaire was constructed
   according to the general tripartite theory of attitudes. A total of 574
   Dutch secondary school students completed the questionnaire. Based on
   principal component analyses, several distinct and independent
   cognitive, affective, and behavioural factors were found, demonstrating
   that attitudes towards biotechnology are a multi-component concept. In
   a cluster analysis on these factors, we found four interpretable
   clusters representing different groups of students. The four groups are
   labelled "confident supporter" (22%), "not sure" (42%), "concerned
   sceptic" (18%), and "not for me" (17%). These results indicate that
   there is a diverse appraisal of modern biotechnology among secondary
   school students. Suggestions for educational interventions are made.

TI Learning how to believe: Epistemic development in cultural context
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES

DT Article
ID COGNITIVE-DEVELOPMENT; STUDENTS; KNOWLEDGE; RELATIVISM
AB Over the last decade, researchers have become increasingly interested
   in students' beliefs about the nature of knowledge and how these
   beliefs develop. Although initial psychological accounts portrayed
   epistemic development as a domain-independent process of cognitive
   maturation, recent studies have found trajectories of epistemic
   development to vary considerably across contexts. However, few studies
   have focused on cultural context. This article examines the role
   community values and practices play in fostering particular
   epistemological orientations by comparing the epistemological beliefs
   of 5th, 8th, and 12th graders (N = 200) from General and Religious
   schools in Israel regarding 2 controversies: belief in God and
   punishment of children. In both controversies, older participants were
   less likely than younger participants to consider the controversy
   rationally decidable. However, this shift emerged earlier in the God
   controversy than in the punishment controversy. In the God controversy,
   General pupils were less likely than Religious pupils to consider the
   question rationally decidable or their own beliefs infallible. But no
   such school differences were observed in the punishment controversy.
   Qualitative and quantitative analyses linked these differences to
   divergent discourse practices at General and Religious schools,
   suggesting that the relations between learning and epistemic
   development are more intricate than has been assumed hitherto.

ID LOW-ACHIEVING STUDENTS; HIGHER-ORDER THINKING; DEPARTMENTS; BELIEFS;
   POLICY
AB This article examines the social nature of teachers' conceptions by
   showing how teachers frame the "mismatch" of students' perceived
   abilities and the intended school curriculum through conversational
   category systems. This study compares the conversations of 2 groups of
   high school mathematics teachers addressing the Mismatch Problem when
   implementing equity-geared reforms. Although East High teachers
   challenged conceptions that were not aligned with a reform, South High
   teachers reworked a reform mandate to align with their existing
   conceptions. This research found that the teachers' conversational
   category systems modeled problems of practice; communicated assumptions
   about students, subject, and teaching; and were ultimately reflected in
   the curriculum. Because East High teachers supported greater numbers of
   students' success in advanced mathematics, this study considers the
   relation between teachers' understandings of student learning and the
   success of equity-geared math reforms. In addition, this study
   contributes to the understanding of how teacher conceptions of students
   are negotiated and reified in context, specifically through
   interactions with colleagues and experiences with school reform.

AB Examining how teachers structure the activities in a unit and how they
   facilitate classroom discussion is important to understand how
   innovative technology-rich curricula work in the context of classroom
   instruction. This study compared 2 enactments of an inquiry curriculum,
   then examined students' learning outcomes in classes taught by 2
   teachers. The quantitative data show that there were significant
   differences in the learning outcomes of students in classes of the 2
   teachers. This study then examined classroom enactments by the 2
   teachers to understand the differences in the learning outcomes. This
   research specifically focused on how teacher-led discussions (a) helped
   connect the activities within a curriculum unit and (b) enabled deeper
   conceptual understanding by helping students make connections between
   science concepts and principles. This study examined the role that
   teacher facilitation played in helping students focus on the relations
   between the various activities in the unit and the concepts that they
   were learning. The results point to important differences in the 2
   enactments, helping to understand better what strategies might enable a
   deeper conceptual understanding of the science content.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
AB For learners in distributed e-learning environments, it is difficult,
   but very important, to locate the right peer for collaboration on the
   right knowledge, at the right time and in the right way. This paper
   proposes the use of context awareness (CA) to support peer
   recommendation in the e-learning context. For this purpose, this paper
   explores the e-learning context that involves knowledge, social and
   technical contexts. Accordingly, this paper proposes a
   three-dimensional CA model for peer recommendation that includes CA to
   knowledge potential, social proximity and technical access. By matching
   the peer seeker and the peer candidate with respect to these three
   dimensions, the CA information is promising as an aid to the peer
   seeker in finding suitable knowledge collaborators. The importance of
   activity context is highlighted in CA-supported peer-recommendation
   mechanism. A five-dimensional (who, what, how, when and where)
   representation approach is suggested for activity-context description.

AB There is a need for collaborative group activities that promote student
   social interaction in the classroom. Handheld computers interconnected
   by a wireless network allow people who work on a common task to
   interact face to face while maintaining the mediation afforded by a
   technology-based system. Wirelessly interconnected handhelds open up
   new opportunities for introducing collaboration and thereby changing
   classroom pedagogical practices. We present a conceptual framework and
   a method for the design of a mobile computer-supported collaborative
   learning system based on Activity theory. An instance of the framework
   for teaching basic mathematics skills was evaluated with 24 6- and
   7-year-old children in a month-long study. Positive effects were
   observed on student social interaction, motivation and learning.

TI Fostering collaborative knowledge construction in a video-based
   learning setting: effects of a shared workspace and a content-specific
   graphical representation
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTS
AB This study examined means of fostering videoconference-based
   collaborative learning. An experiment was conducted with 15 learning
   dyads divided into three conditions of videoconference-based learning:
   without shared workspace, with shared workspace and with shared
   workspace plus a content-specific graphical representation. Compared
   with those with a shared workspace, learning dyads without a shared
   workspace in the videoconference-based setting tended to make more
   effort at verbal coordination. This coordination effort did not affect
   the quality of collaboratively written texts or individual knowledge
   acquisition. Without shared workspace, participants' coordinative
   utterances involved more frequent referrals to the learning content,
   which might have facilitated the cognitive processing of the learning
   content and might have compensated for the potential disadvantage of
   verbal coordination load. The content-specific graphical representation
   led to more coherent content-related dialogues and had positive effects
   on the quality of the collaboratively written texts and on individual
   knowledge acquisition. The study shows that content-specific graphical
   representation can be a meaningful support measure in
   videoconference-based learning settings, whereas the effects of a
   shared workspace should be further investigated.

ID GAMES; ACHIEVEMENT
AB This study investigated the effects of gameplaying on fifth-graders'
   maths performance and attitudes. One hundred twenty five fifth graders
   were recruited and assigned to a cooperative Teams-Games-Tournament
   (TGT), interpersonal competitive or no gameplaying condition. A state
   standards-based maths exam and an inventory on attitudes towards maths
   were used for the pretest and Posttest. The students' gender,
   socio-economic status and prior maths ability were examined as the
   moderating variables and covariate. Multivariate analysis of covariance
   (MANCOVA) indicated that gameplaying was more effective than drills in
   promoting maths performance, and cooperative gameplaying was most
   effective for promoting positive maths attitudes regardless of
   students' individual differences.

TI The influence of instructional methods on the quality of online
   discussion
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID FORUMS
AB In this case study, we examined the influence of five groups of
   communication activities on the quality of students' contributions to
   online discussion. The activities were the nominal group technique,
   debate, invited expert, WebQuest and reflective deliberation. Quality
   of discussion was operationalised as cognitive presence, a construct
   developed to investigate the role of critical discourse in higher,
   distance education contexts. Using the quantitative content analysis
   technique, the postings of 19 students in an undergraduate university
   course were assigned to one of the four categories of cognitive
   presence. Across the five activities, the proportion and number of
   contributions categorised in the highest phases of cognitive presence
   was low (20.21%), but was highest during the Webquest and debate
   activities. There are three advantageous qualities of these two
   activities, we argue:
   1. They were well structured.
   2. They provided clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the
   students.
   3. They provoked the students to explicitly confront others' opinions.

   thinking Occurred and student participation remained high throughout
   the length of both threaded discussions, regardless of the amount of

TI From strategic planning to meaningful learning: diverse perspectives on
   the development of web-based teaching and learning in higher education
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper reports the results of a study on strategic planning and
   implementation of information and communication technology (ICT) in
   teaching and describes the level of quality awareness in web-based
   teaching at the University of Helsinki. Ouestionnaire survey data
   obtained from deans and institutional leaders. ICT support staff,
   teachers and students (n = 333) at the University indicate that
   strategic planning has proceeded well, and all the faculties of the
   University have developed virtual university strategies in order to
   continue existing ICT initiatives, to further increase the use of ICT
   in teaching and to assure student information literacy. The data
   indicate that all the faculties and institutions have monitored and
   reported the use of ICT in teaching, but quality assurance or
   enhancement as tools for monitoring were mentioned less frequently. The
   available ICT training was found satisfactory to meet the actual
   training needs of the teachers, but their lack of time was judged to be
   the main obstacle to their participation in it. The teachers identified
   two basic functions of ICT in teaching: (1) distribution of course
   material via the web, and (2) the creation of interactive and
   collaborative learning opportunities. The male teachers and students
   consistently estimated that their ICT skills were stronger when
   compared with the judgements made by female teachers and students. The
   teachers generally felt that the greatest problems arose from students'
   lack of time management skills and from deficiencies in the usability
   of the technology. The students did not perceive lack of time
   management as a problem. Rather, they experienced isolation, loneliness
   and the lack of practical ICT usability to be the main obstacles to
   learning. The teachers had a higher assessment of students' learning
   than the students did. The greatest difference between teachers and
   students concerned the contextual nature of learning in a virtual
   environment. The fact that the teachers' views were markedly more
   positive signals a distinct challenge for pedagogy.

TI The effectiveness of information and communication technology on the
   learning of written English for 5-to 16-year-olds
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The last few years have seen an increase in research studies on the
   impact and effectiveness of information and communication technologies
   (ICTs) in the teaching and learning of English as a school subject. It
   is against that research background and against recent developments in
   policy and practice in the UK that the present systematic review of the
   effectiveness of different ICTs in the teaching and learning of English
   has been undertaken. The aim of this review was to shed light on
   whether ICTs are effective in the teaching and learning of English for
   5- to 16-year-olds. A total of 2103 papers were found in the initial
   search of studies published between 1998 and 2003 on the topic of the
   review. An in-depth review on the effectivencss of ICT in the teaching
   and learning of written composition in English concentrated on nine
   studies. As eight of the nine studies were judged to be of medium
   weight of evidence and were also different from each other in nature,
   it was not possible to arrive at a clear answer to our in-depth
   research question. Rather, we wish to report that the field is in a
   preparadigmatic state where definitions of English, literacy and ICT
   are still relatively unclear, and where the causal and/or reciprocal
   relationships between them have yet to be fully theorised.

TI Blending online learning with traditional approaches: changing practices
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Considerable claims have been made for the development of e-learning,
   either as stand-alone programmes or alongside more traditional
   approaches to teaching and learning, for students across school and
   tertiary education. National initiatives have improved the position of
   schools in terms of access to hardware and electronic networking,
   software and educational resources, and staff development. The
   potential of e-learning to improve learning and teaching, and in turn,
   attainment, may be contested by academics but the policy makers arc
   generally positive. Many countries across Europe and North America have
   adopted information and communication technology (ICT) as a central
   plank in school improvement and effectiveness planning. At the centre,
   however, remain the teacher and the learner. The impact of ICT on the
   learning experience will depend upon the roles adopted by each, the
   model of the learner held by the teacher and the pedagogy adopted. This
   paper considers the ways in which teachers and students responded to
   the implementation of one particular online programme and considers the
   approaches adopted and the attitudes to its use. The SCHOLAR programme
   is designed to complement rather than replace traditional teaching and
   learning approaches within schools and is aimed at students in the
   post-compulsory years of secondary school working towards external
   certification. It has a number of features including course materials,
   revision exercises, self-assessment facilities and a discussion forum.
   The independent evaluation of SCHOLAR looked at the impact that its use
   made on learning and teaching in the post-16 classroom and the
   differing ways in which teachers and students used the various elements
   of the programme. While it did appear to have a positive impact on
   attainment, the evidence indicates that this might have been greater
   had the teachers modified their practice, blending learning through
   SCHOLAR with more traditional methods.

DT Article
AB This paper provides a metareview of how e-learning content is currently
   being produced and embedded in the learning practice in further
   education, work-based learning and community learning contexts. Based
   upon this metareview, the paper has identified four categories of
   content production used: (1) learner-authored content, (2)
   practitioner-authored content, (3) commercial- and public
   sector-commissioned content and (4) combinations of these categories.
   The metareview also identifies several well-used, practitioner-based
   and institutional models for embedding e-learning content into

   MODEL
AB Although wireless and mobile technology is regarded as a useful tool
   for enhancing student-centered learning, few studies have explored the
   factors that may affect the application of this emerging technology in
   classroom situations. Accordingly, this study selects three factors (
   instructional belief, instructional routine, and features of wireless
   and mobile technology) via literature review, then utilizes a
   case-study method with a focus class and teacher to explore the effects
   of these factors on teaching in wireless environments. The main study
   results are summarized as follows: first, the case teacher held
   positive beliefs regarding student-centered instruction and innovative
   technology, but the teacher's instructional practices were
   significantly restricted by the teacher-centered approach. This
   inconsistency between instructional beliefs and practices resulted in
   the teacher being willing to apply wireless technology but unable to
   bring it into full play. Second, the strong stress and misgivings about
   changes in instructional methods prevented the teacher from altering
   instructional routines. The contrast between student expectations
   regarding technological applications and the practical application of
   technology by teachers caused negative reciprocal effects. Finally, the
   workshop that adopted top-down dissemination and did not use on-site
   support in this study cannot encourage changes in instruction methods
   used by teachers. It is recommended that effective learning communities
   and teacher development programs be developed.

DE learning designs; collaborative learning flow patterns; coordination;

ID DESIGN
AB Collaborative Learning Flow Patterns (CLFPs) have recently emerged as a
   new method to formulate best practices in structuring the flow of
   activities within various collaborative learning scenarios. The term
   "learning flow" is used to describe coordination and sequencing of
   learning tasks.
   This paper adopts the existing concept of CLFP and argues that many of
   these patterns are already using, or could use, collaborative editing
   activities that need to be process-driven. Consequently, the paper
   proposes a Process-Driven Collaborative Editing Pattern (PDCEP). The
   paper also describes how this new pattern relates to the existing
   examples of CLFPs and IMS-LD best-practices. The proposed pattern
   incorporates temporal and deontic constraints, used to specify the
   process of collaborative editing. The approach is demonstrated by an
   example of the electronic debate learning activity and its
   corresponding CLFP.

AB One Master's Program, Initiatives in Educational Transformation, has
   integrated a computer management system (WebCT) into a learner-centered
   (Weimer, 2002) community of K-12 practicing teachers. Online
   discussions were an extension of instructional practices that supported
   dialogue, reflection, and self-assessment for the purpose of continuous
   professional improvement and facilitating independent learners. The
   research question that guided this study was, how can we develop
   self-monitoring and acceptance of online discussions so that students
   become independent learners? Online discussion postings and student
   self-assessment served as data sources. Three dominant themes emerged
   from the data. The first theme, Community of Practice: Dialogue
   Supports Independent Learning, captures the components of Wenger's (
   2005) community of practice that enhance students' personal and
   professional experiences in shaping online discussions. The second
   theme, Independent Learners: Making Sense of Theory, addresses how
   educational theory, classroom pedagogical practices, dialogue, and
   lived experiences support the transformation of practice. A third
   theme,Self-Assessment Informs Understanding of Self and
   Discussion-Group Dynamics, conveys the ways in which self-assessment
   informs students of their strengths, and student-identified areas of
   improvement support independent learners as well as foster deepened
   understanding of participation within online discussion groups. Online
   Communities of Practice (CoP) support students' professional sharing
   and the development of independent learners. Faculty played an
   important role in structuring student reflection and self-assessment
   opportunities to enhance the learning experiences for students.

AB Integrating Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into
   teaching and learning is a growing area that has attracted many
   educators' efforts in recent years. Based on the scope of content
   covered, ICT integration can happen in three different areas:
   curriculum, topic, and lesson. This paper elaborates upon the concept
   of ICT integration, and presents a systematic planning model for
   guiding ICT integration in the topic area. A sample of an ICT
   integration plan is described in this paper to demonstrate how this
   model can be applied in practice.

AB This paper reports on a locally initiated investigation into the
   suitability of the Internet in helping to meet the information needs of
   women in small, medium, and micro enterprises (SMMEs) in the textile
   industry in Botswana. The background is the stated government policy to
   encourage the development of SMMEs and the Internet infrastructure. The
   question is, how likely are women entrepreneurs to use a website as a
   resource? We considered two barriers to the use of technology by women
   in developing countries, socio-cultural and physical. To determine the
   extent to which these could be overcome, a design experiment was
   conducted in which an information website was created and its use
   evaluated on a target population consisting of women entrepreneurs in
   the textile industry in Botswana. Data collection occurred in two
   phases. Firstly, interviews were conducted and conferences were
   attended to determine the information needs. Then a website was
   developed and evaluated by think-aloud protocols, focus groups, and
   interviews. Initial results indicate that the site was both useful and
   usable to the target population and that it made some work easier for
   them. Nevertheless, they need to use the Internet not only to receive
   information, but also to provide information in order to trade and sell
   their own goods. This has implications for government policy in terms
   of enabling credit card-based international trading using the Web.

ID ABDUCTION; PEIRCE; CONSTRUCTIVISM; SCIENCE
AB Abduction is a method of reasoning that people use under uncertainty in
   a context in order to come up with new ideas. The use of abduction in
   this exploratory study is twofold: (i) abduction is a
   cross-disciplinary analytic tool that can be used to explain certain
   key aspects of human-computer interaction in advanced Information
   Society Technology(IST)environments; (ii) abduction is probably the
   central inferential mechanism at work when learners learn or in general
   make sense of things in an IST or mobile context. Consequently,
   abduction illuminates the special epistemological circumstances of IST
   enhanced learning, in particular when the learning materials and the
   learning environment have been arranged in accordance with
   constructivist pedagogical guidelines. A study of abductive reasoning
   will help us better understand IST enhanced learning and IST user
   behaviour as well as give us some valuable hints to the design of
   human-computer interaction in general.

AB The purpose of this research project was to determine the effects of
   incorporating concept mapping on the achievement of fifth grade
   students in science class. The study was conducted with twenty-three
   students at Ata Elementary School, Trabzon, Turkey. The students were
   tested with teacher-constructed pre- and post tests containing 20
   multiple-choice questions. The pupils in the experimental and control
   groups were exposed to the same teaching techniques covering a unit on
   heat and temperature. They were given the same pretest after the
   initial lessons. However, after the pretest, the control group was
   given a traditional oral review of the material and the experimental
   group was exposed to the review by the use of Inspiration, which is
   computer based concept mapping tool. After these reviews, the students
   on both groups were given the posttest. Test scores were analyzed for
   any statistically significantly difference in the scores on the test.
   The results from present study indicate that concept mapping has a
   noticeable impact on student achievement in science classes.

AB Animated demonstrations are increasingly used for presenting the
   functionality of various computer applications. Nevertheless, our
   understanding of whether and how students integrate this technology
   into their learning strategies remains limited. Although, several
   studies have examined animated demonstrations' learning efficiency,
   this study aims at investigating users' initial attitudes towards
   animated demonstrations as computer learning tools. Attitudes about
   knowledge sources play a determinative role for their acceptance.
   Quantitative and qualitative information was collected from forty-six
   interviews with students who used animated demonstrations for the first
   time. Students appraised animated demonstrations with regard to their
   authentic representation of task sequences, arguing that comprehension
   of the demonstrations did not entail intensive metacognitive burdens.
   On the contrary, students claimed that animated demonstrations had
   browsing inefficiencies and sometimes failed to satisfy individual
   learning needs. Interview transcripts revealed that students' attitudes
   were influenced by several factors, such as the nature of the computer
   application to be learnt, students' prior knowledge of that
   application, their prior learning practices, narrator's
   characteristics, simulated practice options and the procedural
   segmentation of the presentation. Results of the study can be exploited
   to enhance the design of educational applications that incorporate
   animated demonstrations.

TI The crisis of educational technology, and the prospect of reinventing
   education
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE education; educational technology; paradigmatic conflict; information
   age
AB With the fading monopoly of the industrial mode of production and the
   emergence of the "information revolution," modern technology has
   pervaded almost every aspect of human life. In education, however,
   information technology has yet to find a place, despite the unceasing
   attempts to "fit" it into the existing educational system. The paper
   argues that the industrial mode of production was successful in
   inventing "education" as a new paradigm, institutionalizing it in
   schools, and implementing it through a number of tools, such as
   "certified" teachers, curricula, and textbooks. By contrast, the
   information mode of production has created the tools, namely "
   educational technology," before developing a corresponding paradigm or
   institution. This crisis of educational technology is therefore a
   corollary of its misplacement, and subsequent malfunction, in the
   still-in-use industrial paradigm and institution ( education and
   school). The paper suggests that, in order to ensure a proper
   functionality of modern technology, we need to resolve this theoretical
   inadequacy. A possible solution would be to thoroughly restructure
   "education" and schools, as remnants of the industrial age, into a new
   paradigm and institution.

DE educational modelling; interoperability of educational [sub-] systems;
   educational ontologies; case study
AB Educational modelling is the modelling of educational [sub-] systems.
   Such a model is a framework containing important concepts, processes
   and relations. Several models have been published but their
   development, which we call educational modelling, still is a tedious
   process. We lack clear guidelines or a methodology. In this article we
   present a case study in which we take first steps towards the
   development of a methodology for educational modelling. We do so by
   analysing our current practice that we typify as expert-driven,
   model-centred and consensus-based. We explicate the assumptions under
   this approach and investigate whether these assumptions are explicit
   and confirmed by our case study. The results give rise to a number of
   guidelines that can be used by future projects and that provide a first
   step towards a more systematic approach to educational modelling.

DE SCORM specification; content components; content components reference
   model; sharable content object; open content object
AB The Open Content Object (OCO), which was put forward in the author's
   previous paper, is an object that has the function of requesting
   services and providing services through the messages-passing mechanism,
   which relies on the Learning Management System (LMS) as the scheduling
   center of messages. The OCOs can offer a particular and flexible
   approach to designing the interoperable web-based content aggregation
   through its containers and organizing the learning sequence through the
   associational relationships between OCOs. This paper discusses how to
   extend the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM)
   Specification for applying the Open Content Object. The extensions to
   the SCORM Specification include extending SCORM's Content Aggregation
   Model and Run-Time Environment in light of the OCO's open
   characteristic. The paper also presents the XML binding and
   implementation of extending SCORM's Content Aggregation Model and some
   simple examples of using this extended reference model. The Open
   Content Object can be applied to the web-based learning contents
   through the extended SCORM specification presented by this paper, and
   it is hoped that the Open Content Object will offer some references for
   the next generation model of ADL/SCORM's content object.

DT Article
ID POLICY
AB Professional development is seen as one of the major levers for
   aligning science instruction in the USA with the vision put forth by
   national standards documents. Although there is a growing consensus
   regarding what constitutes effective professional development, there is
   little empirical evidence to support this consensus. This study
   examines the impact of professional development that is content based,
   situated in classroom practice, and sustained over time on teacher
   attitudes, perceptions of preparedness, and classroom practices. It
   utilizes longitudinal data from the National Science Foundation's Local
   Systemic Change through Teacher Enhancement Initiative (LSC), collected
   from 42 projects over a span of 7 years. The professional development
   model used in the LSCs differed from previous initiatives in that it
   targeted all teachers in a jurisdiction and emphasized preparing
   teachers to implement project designated instructional materials.
   Analyses of the data provide evidence that this model for professional
   development has an impact on teachers and their classroom practices. In
   addition, the analyses found that teachers' perception of principal
   support for Standards-based science instruction is an important
   predictor of these outcomes. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   BELIEFS; CONCEPTIONS; IMPLEMENTATION; CURRICULUM; SCHOOL; MATHEMATICS;

AB Understanding the interaction between internally constructed and
   externally imposed aspects of the teaching context may be the missing
   link between calls for school reform and teachers' interpretation and
   implementation of that reform. Although the context of the local school
   culture has a profound impact on teachers, there are other external
   forces that are specifically aimed at influencing teachers' pedagogical
   and curricular decisions. These externally imposed aspects of context
   include some of the existing tools of reform, such as national
   standards, mandated state core curricula, and related
   criterion-referenced testing. However, little is known about how these
   reform tools impact teachers' thinking about science and science
   teaching or how teachers respond to such tools. This study examined the
   interactions between individual teachers' beliefs about teaching and
   learning science in elementary school and the tools of reform that are
   imposed upon them. Comparative case studies were conducted in which two
   elementary teachers' science instruction, teaching context, and related
   beliefs were examined, described, and analyzed. In this study, the
   teachers' fundamental beliefs about science and what it means to teach
   and learn science influenced their interpretations of the sometimes
   contradictory messages of reform as they are represented in the
   standards, mandated curriculum, and end-of-level tests. Suggestions
   about what these findings mean for needed aspects of teacher
   professional development are offered. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This article is situated within a theoretical framework, instructional
   congruence, articulating issues of student diversity with the demands
   of academic disciplines. In the context of a large-scale study
   targeting elementary school science, the article describes a research
   instrument that aims to combine the strengths of both quantitative and
   qualitative approaches to classroom data. The project-developed
   classroom observation guideline is a series of detailed scales that
   produce numerical ratings based on qualitative observations of
   different aspects of classroom practice. The article's objectives are
   both pedagogical and methodological, reflecting the dual functionality
   of the instrument: (a) to concretize theoretical constructs
   articulating academic disciplines with student diversity in ways that
   are useful for rethinking classroom practice; and (b) to take advantage
   of the strengths of qualitative educational research, but within a
   quantitative analytical framework that may be applied across large
   numbers of classrooms. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID KNOWLEDGE MAPS; VALIDITY; SYSTEM; TOOL
AB Three experiments were conducted to examine the effects of map
   structure, concept quantification, and focus question on dynamic
   thinking during a Concept Map (CMap) construction task. The first
   experiment compared cyclic and hierarchical structures. The second
   experiment examined the impact of the quantification of the header
   concept in the map. The third experiment explored the effect of the
   focus question on the map. For all three experiments, the content of
   the CMaps was assessed for the number of dynamic propositions and the
   number of quantified concepts. The results show that the cyclic
   structure, the quantification of the header concept, and the focus
   question "How" significantly increased dynamic thinking. The Studies,
   the theoretical background, and the implications of the findings are
   discussed. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   connections between the "funds of knowledge" that urban, high-poverty
   students bring to science learning and the development of a sustained
   interest in science. We found that youth developed a sustained interest
   in science when: (1) their science experiences connected with how they
   envision their own futures; (2) learning environments supported the
   kinds of social relationships students valued; and (3) science
   activities supported students' sense of agency for enacting their views
   on the purpose of science. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI What is the role of constructivist teachers within faculty
   communication networks?
SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMUNITIES; POLICY
AB Using the biology faculty of one high school (n = 9) and the
   mathematics faculty of another (n = 16), this study tested the
   hypothesis that constructivist teachers play an active role within
   teacher communication networks (the con structivist-teacher
   hypothesis). This hypothesis contrasts with the view that
   constructivist teachers operate alone and largely severed from
   communications among colleagues. Two types of representations of
   communication patterns among faculty members (i.e., sociographs) were
   created and analyzed for each faculty. One type of sociograph plotted
   communications concerning content/pedagogical issues while the other
   type plotted social/informal communications. Trained raters assessed
   constructivist-teaching practices using the Reformed Teaching
   Observation Protocol (RTOP). Positive relationships were found between
   con structivist-teaching practices and the frequency and significance
   of communications within both faculties-more so for content/pedagogical
   issues than for social/informal communications. Importantly, peers
   sought out constructivist teachers more often than they did traditional
   teachers, presumably seeking advice regarding teaching practice.
   Results support the constructivist-teacher hypothesis and indicate that
   constructivist teachers are not isolated from their peers. Instead,
   they appear to play an active role, particularly when colleagues are
   discussing issues related to content and pedagogy. (c) 2007 Wiley

   Based on an analysis of responses from scientists to anomalous data
   taken from identification experiments on the Vinland Map, it was
   assumed that an additional response-uncertainty about interpretation of
   the data-should be considered in addition to the other eight responses
   reported by Chinn and Brewer (1998). It was also assumed that a process
   of responses containing more than one response is possible for a given
   subject who is responding to a given piece of anomalous datum in the
   laboratory. Both assumptions were verified by examining responses of
   undergraduates to anomalous data obtained from repeatable laboratory
   experiments. The results of this study show that there are nine
   categories of responses: ignoring; rejection; uncertainty of validity;
   uncertainty of interpretation; exclusion; abeyance; reinterpretation;
   peripheral conceptual change; and conceptual change. Moreover, two
   categories of processing, anomalous data-final response (A-R process)
   and anomalous data-[mediators with/without intermediate
   responses]-final response (A-M-R process), are assessed in this study.
   It is suggested that science instructors could use the nine categories
   of responses to understand the learning characteristics of students,
   and also to use the A-M-R. process to design suitable teaching
   strategies to arrive at meaningful learning. (c) 2006 Wiley

ID THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK; KNOWLEDGE; EXPERIMENTATION; INQUIRY
AB This research explores how six small groups of 14-year-old to
   16-year-old pupils, from three schools, dealt with anomalous results
   when they evaluated science investigations over a 2-year period. The
   pupils were observed, interviewed, and their written reports analysed
   to answer the main questions about their understanding, identification,
   and actions taken about anomalous results. The findings are explored
   and discussed in terms of expectations from conceptual knowledge;
   access to apparatus, time, and assessment constraints in school
   science; and the cognitive and epistemological frameworks used.
   Conclusions are that pupils can identify anomalous results from
   patterns in tables or graph lines of best fit but take little practical
   action about them as they use everyday or "engineering" frameworks
   instead of authentic scientific approaches. The implications for
   management and teaching, for assessment policy, and the curriculum
   model adopted are suggested, as are the implications for further
   research and development in teaching investigative science.

ID PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE
AB The study explored the origins of students' data handling knowledge and
   skills employed during secondary Science lessons. Transfer of learning
   was explored in an authentic school context, describing when transfer
   does and does not occur, conditions that appear to foster transfer, and
   impacts of different types of transfer on teaching and learning. The
   data sets collected through case study methods consisted of 13 units of
   Science lesson observations and interviews with 60 students and 11
   teachers over the course of one academic year. Students' claims of
   where, when, and how they acquired data handling knowledge and skills
   were described and analyzed to determine whether transfer occurred or
   new teaching was required. The findings strongly suggest that transfer
   does occur among secondary school classrooms, having both positive and
   negative outcomes for learning and performance. Thus, educators and
   researchers need to rethink expectations about and implications of this
   transfer.

DE digestion; historical analysis; Portuguese primary school; textbooks
AB Our previous studies have shown that Portuguese primary school pupils
   and teachers have three main difficulties in the representation of the
   digestion process: the sequence of the digestive tract, blood
   absorption, and the relationship of the digestive function with other
   human functions. In this study we analysed the topic of digestion in 63
   Portuguese textbooks ( 1920 - 2005). In general, the textual
   explanation of the digestive process ( including reference to blood
   absorption) is clear, but "confusion" in images is persistent
   throughout the period studied. To demonstrate the influence of the
   period of the Portuguese dictatorship ( 1926 - 1974), a brief
   comparison with French textbooks ( which developed during the same
   period with the aim of presenting clearer representations of the
   digestive tract) was carried out. Results suggest that inadequate
   images in textbooks may be the main didactic obstacle to accurate
   learning of the digestive function.

AB This study investigates how high school students respond to an
   environment of authentic science inquiry while participating in an
   intensive summer institute, the Waksman Student Scholars Programme at
   Rutgers University. We examined how students apprenticed with expert
   scientists in a study of contemporary questions in molecular genetics.
   Students engaged in both laboratory practices and seminars as part of
   their experience in this program. We assessed student learning about
   conceptual knowledge of molecular genetics as well as their beliefs
   about the nature of science. Student conceptual knowledge increased and
   their beliefs about the nature of science changed to a more tentative
   perspective. We examined student learning qualitatively through their
   journals, which showed that some students were developing more
   sophisticated ways of thinking about the issues that were raised in
   their seminars and laboratory research. These ways included an
   increased ability to generate hypotheses, consider alternative
   hypotheses, implement models and logical argumentation in explanations,
   connect ideas, extend concepts, and ask questions. These results
   suggest that meaningfully engaging pre-college students in the practice
   of real science can make a difference in their understanding and
   beliefs.

DE academic performance; Barcelona; cognitive science model; conceptual

ID MENTAL MODELS; CLASSROOM; CONSTRUCTION; EDUCATION
AB We address the question "how does conceptual change take place in the
   science classroom?" from the perspective of Giere's cognitive science
   model. The research work involved a group of 21 students from the first
   year of the Spanish "Bachillerato" or upper secondary school ( 17 year
   olds) in a public high school in Barcelona. Once the students' mental
   representations about respiration were known, the study of their
   evolution started. Academic performance of students was chosen as the
   criterion to select the subjects: one with high academic performance,
   two with medium academic performance, and one with low academic
   performance. The analysis refers to two of the cases that were analyzed
   in depth: one with high academic performance and the other with low
   academic performance. The aim of selecting only these two cases was to
   achieve a better contrast among them. We found that, in some subjects,
   there was co-existence of various stable and useful explicative models,
   with reference to different situations. Other students used
   undifferentiated sets of ideas instead of explicative models; they are
   students who show little critical and abstractive capacity. In our
   study, those students who used models drew more coherent and cohesive
   explanations, and those models were used more specifically according to
   the various contexts. We observed a gradual process of conceptual
   evolution, in which, differentiation among the models that constitute
   the model family, as well as internal enrichment of each of those
   specific models took place at the same time. From this perspective,
   conceptual evolution is not reached by the juxtaposition of ideas
   belonging to different explicative models, but by the identification of
   similarities and differences among the different models that attempt to
   explain a given reality.

TI Personally-seeded discussions to scaffold online argumentation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE dialectical argumentation; rhetorical argumentation; scientific inquiry
ID SCHOOL SCIENCE; CLASSROOM; KNOWLEDGE; PEDAGOGY; THINKING
AB Research shows that scientific knowledge develops through a process of
   decision-making as well as discovery, and that argumentation is a genre
   of discourse crucial to the practice of science. Students should
   therefore be supported in understanding the scientific practices of
   dialectical and rhetorical argumentation as part of learning about
   scientific inquiry. This study focuses on supporting scientific
   argumentation in the classroom through a customized online discourse
   system. "Personally-seeded discussions" support learning and
   collaboration through an activity structure that elicits, shares, and
   contrasts students' own ideas to engage them in the discourse of
   science argumentation and inquiry. Students use an online interface to
   build principles to describe data they have collected. These principles
   become the seed comments for the online discussions. The software sorts
   students into discussion groups with students who have built different
   principles so that each discussion group can consider and critique
   multiple perspectives. This study explores the efficacy of this
   personally-seeded approach based on a coding scheme developed by
   Erduran, Osborne, and Simon that analyzes argument structure from a
   Toulmin perspective. As part of this exploration, the study outlines a
   method for parsing personally-seeded discussions into oppositional
   episodes for analysis, and discusses future directions for supporting
   argumentation in asynchronous online discussions.

AB The Faulkes Telescope Project and its educational aims are briefly
   summarised. Research to evaluate its impact in inspiring excitement and
   interest among students is described. The Faulkes Telescope in Hawaii
   was used to provide images for assessed coursework based on two of the
   Faulkes "education/research" projects on galaxies. Students' attitudes
   to various aspects of using the telescope and to the two galaxy
   projects were obtained using a questionnaire and free-response
   comments. The students were found to be enthusiastic about all aspects
   of the telescope and the idea of carrying out serious science
   investigations based on the images that they had obtained.

AB This case study examines the performances of 18 10th-grade students (
   age 15 - 16 years) in the process of performing problem-solving tasks
   in the physics and chemistry laboratory. The study focuses on different
   types of problems arising in the process of transferring responsibility
   to students in a context of teacher assistance to autonomous
   problem-solving. The students' conversations were audiotaped and
   videotaped, and their productions collected. Problems were found in
   relation to excessive task difficulty, to stereotyped school culture
   reflecting procedural display rather than genuine problem-solving, and
   to problems related to within-group interactions and roles. The
   findings are discussed in reference to the educational goal of students
   progressively assuming responsibility in their own learning.

AB The international science education community recognises the role of
   pre-service science teachers' views about the interdependence of
   Science, Technology, and Society (STS) in achieving scientific literacy
   for all. To this end, pre-service science teachers' STS views signal
   the strengths and the weaknesses of science education reform movements.
   Turkey, a country that follows the international reform movement, aims
   at improving citizen's understanding of the STS interdependence to
   enable them to fully participate in an industrialised, democratic
   society. This study explores the Turkish pre-service science teachers'
   views (n = 176) on STS issues and discusses the ongoing reform efforts'
   strengths and weaknesses within the context of the study findings. Data
   were collected through an adopted "Views on Science - Technology -
   Society" instrument. Analysis revealed that many participants held
   realistic views on science, technology, and society interdependence,
   while their views on technology and the nature of science were
   differed. Some viewed technology as an application of science, and some
   viewed science as explanatory and an interpretation of nature. Most
   agreed that the scientific knowledge is tentative but they did not
   present a thorough understanding of the differences between hypotheses,
   laws, and theories.

AB This paper presents an investigation centered on a guided conceptual
   path concerning magnetic and gravitational fields, proposed for
   children aged 9 - 11. The goal is to appreciate to what extent the idea
   of "mapping" two fields of interaction is accessible and fruitful for
   children of that age. The conceptual target is to link magnetic and
   gravitational sources with their respective field lines, and then use
   this linkage to differentiate between the two kinds of interactions.
   This study shows that the proposed "mapping" and the differences
   between the maps are accessible to a large proportion of pupils. By
   contrast, only a minority can differentiate between the two types of
   interactions: the idea of mere attraction remains dominant and may
   screen the idea of orientation. Finally, we discuss to what extent
   these exploratory results confirm the relevancy of such teaching goals
   and how they inform the design of research-based teaching sequences
   concerning this topic.

TI Understanding genetics: Analysis of secondary students' conceptual
   status
SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING
LA English
DT Article
ID REPRESENTATIONS; DIFFICULTIES; CLASSROOM; FRAMEWORK; BIOLOGY; SCIENCE
AB This article explores the conceptual change of students in Grades 10
   and 12 in three Australian senior high schools when the teachers
   included computer multimedia to a greater or lesser extent in their
   teaching of a genetics course. The study, underpinned by a
   multidimensional conceptual-change framework, used an interpretive
   approach and a case-based design with multiple data collection methods.
   Over 4-8 weeks, the students learned genetics in classroom lessons that
   included BioLogica activities, which feature multiple representations.
   Results of the online tests and interview tasks revealed that most
   students improved their understanding of genetics as evidenced in the
   development of genetics reasoning. However, using Thorley's (1990)
   status analysis categories, a cross-case analysis of the gene
   conceptions of 9 of the 26 students interviewed indicated that only 4
   students' postinstructional conceptions were intelligible
   -plausible-fruitful. Students' conceptual change was consistent with
   classroom teaching and learning. Findings suggested that multiple
   representations supported conceptual understanding of genetics but not
   in all students. It was also shown that status can be a viable hallmark
   enabling researchers to identify students' conceptual change that would
   otherwise be less accessible. Thorley's method for analyzing conceptual
   status is discussed. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study examines the relationship between biology teachers'
   evolution teaching practices and their regard and use of Indiana state
   evolution standards. A survey developed by the authors contained five
   subscales: use of standards; attitude toward standards; attitude toward
   evolution standards; evolution teaching practices; and demographic
   information. This survey was administered to 229 Indiana biology
   teachers. Data were analyzed using the Rasch model to convert Likert
   rating scale data into ratio data used for parametric analyses.
   Correlation analysis revealed significant relationships between use of
   standards and attitude toward standards, attitude toward standards and
   evolution teaching practices, and attitude toward evolution standards
   and days teaching evolution. These findings suggest practical
   relationships between standards use, teachers' regard of standards, and
   evolution teaching practices. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Electrochemistry plays an important role in curricula, textbooks, and
   in everyday life. The purpose of the present study was to identify and
   understand secondary-school students' problems in learning
   electrochemistry at an introductory chemistry level. The investigation
   covered four areas: (a) electrolytes, (b) transport of electric charges
   in electrolyte solutions, (c) the anode and the cathode, and (d) the
   minus and plus poles. Written tests were given to high-school students
   in five cycles. The population from which random samples were drawn
   totalled 15,700 subjects. Students were asked to select the correct
   answers and to justify their choices. It was found that students based
   their reasoning on four alternative concepts: (a) During electrolysis,
   the electric current produces ions; (b) electrons migrate through the
   solution from one electrode to the other; (c) the cathode is always the
   minus pole, the anode the plus pole; and (d) the plus and minus poles
   carry charges. The results suggest a teaching strategy in which
   students first experience and learn about electrochemistry concepts. In
   the second step, appropriate concept terms are added, and students then
   are confronted with the alternative concepts described in this article.

ID TEACHERS; ENERGY
AB The aim of the present study is to shed light on the conceptions that
   young students have of heat and temperature, concepts that are both
   important in school science curricula and closely related to daily
   life. The subjects of the study were students from a rural district in
   South Korea and they ranged in age from 4 to 11 years. Interviews were
   conducted with each student on the basis of questions on temperature,
   thermal insulation, and heat equilibrium. After calculating the
   frequency and percentage of student responses and analyzing the
   rationale for their answers, it was found that younger students tended
   to view temperature as "size" or a "summation of numbers." This
   tendency gradually diminished in older students. Most students had
   alternative conceptions of thermal insulation regardless of age;
   however, reasoning differed according to age. Younger students
   displayed a greater tendency to view insulation as a material property,
   whereas older students showed a greater tendency toward rational heat
   and temperature conceptions. Most students did not have clear concepts
   of heat equilibrium regardless of age, but possessed numerous
   alternative conceptions. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This research consists of a longitudinal study of 12 female elementary
   preservice teachers' conceptual understanding over the course of
   several months. The context in which the participants received
   instruction was in an inquiry-based physics course, and the targeted
   science content was the cause of moon phases. Qualitative research
   methods, including observations and interviews, were used to
   investigate and describe participants' conceptual understanding over
   time. Participants were interviewed on their understanding of the cause
   of moon phases before instruction, 3 weeks after instruction, and again
   in delayed post-interviews several months after instruction. Patterns
   and themes in the participants' conceptual understanding were
   identified through constant-comparative data analysis. Consistent with
   results reported earlier, participants who had instruction that
   included recording and analyzing moon observations over time and
   psychomotor modeling of changes in moon phases were very likely to hold
   a scientific conceptual understanding shortly after instruction. The
   present study indicates a majority of participants continued to hold a
   scientific understanding six months or more after instruction. However,
   some participants reverted to alternative conceptions they had shown
   during the pre-interview. These results are interpreted utilizing
   contemporary conceptual change theory. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Students' mental models of the environment
SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING
LA English
DT Article
ID CHILDREN
AB What are students' mental models of the environment? In what ways, if
   any, do students' mental models vary by grade level or community
   setting? These two questions guided the research reported in this
   article. The Environments Task was administered to students from 25
   different teacher-classrooms. The student responses were first
   inductively analyzed in order to identify students' mental models of
   the environment. The second phase of analysis involved the statistical
   testing of the identified mental models. From this analysis four mental
   models emerged: Model 1, the environment as a place where
   animals/plants live-a natural place; Model 2, the environment as a
   place that supports life; Model 3, the environment as a place impacted
   or modified by human activity; and Model 4, the environment as a place
   where animals, plants, and humans live. The dominant mental model was
   Mental Model 1. Yet, a greater frequency of urban students than
   suburban and rural students held Mental Model 3. The implications to
   environmental science education are explored. (c) 2007 Wiley

SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING

ID PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE; STUDENTS; EVAPORATION;

AB As contact with liquids occurs from an early stage in individuals'
   lives, children construct explanations for liquids and liquid-state
   phenomena. These may differ from the accepted scientific explanations,
   interfere with formal teaching, and even persist until entry into
   higher education. The objective of this investigation is to compare
   student-teachers' and in-service science teachers' explanations for
   liquid-state phenomena, in three European countries. Data were
   collected by means of a questionnaire applied to 195 Italian,
   Portuguese, and Spanish in-service science teachers. Data analysis
   revealed poor performance among participants, showing low percentages
   of correct answers. In addition, no systematic differences were found
   between participants from the three countries, and teaching experience
   seems to minimize some of the conceptual difficulties showed by
   in-service teachers. Globally, science education seems to have had a
   limited effect on student-teachers' and in-service science teachers'
   conceptions. We conclude that more attention should be paid to the
   liquid state in both initial and continuing teacher education programs
   so that teachers can understand more clearly liquid-state phenomena and
   succeed in explaining them to their students. (c) 2007 Wiley

AB In this study, we used qualitative methods to help us better understand
   the experiences of instructors as they are persuaded to adopt a course
   management system and integrate it into their teaching. We discuss
   several patterns explaining how instructors implemented Blackboard, a
   CMS, by experimenting with individual features, facing both technical
   and integration challenges, and attempting to adapt Blackboard features
   to match their goals and practices. We also give explanations for why
   instructors either (a) embraced the tool and grew more dependent on it,
   (b) reduced their use of the tool to only some features, or (c)
   discontinued the tool and actively sought replacement options. In this
   paper we explain why instructors fell into any one of these three areas
   and what implications this may have for training and support needs.

AB Current teaching and learning methods reveal marked differences between
   how students approach learning and how instructors approach teaching.
   Little attention has been paid to understanding these differences and
   their implications for designing successful learning environments. The
   purpose of the paper is to introduce a framework for understanding and
   reconciling perspectives on teaching and learning success. First, we
   examine perspectives on learning success. Next, we compare and contrast
   beliefs and practices associated with teaching and learning. Finally,
   we introduce a model for reconciling teaching and learning beliefs and
   practices, and discuss implications for future research and practice.

AB Complex computer and video games may provide a vehicle, based on
   appropriate theoretical concepts, to transform the educational
   landscape. Building on the original game object model (GOM) a new more
   detailed model is developed to support concepts that educational
   computer games should: be relevant, explorative, emotive, engaging, and
   include complex challenges; support authentic learning activities that
   are designed as narrative social spaces where learners are transformed
   through exploration of multiple representation, and reflection; be
   gender-inclusive, include non-confrontational outcomes, and provide
   appropriate role models; develop democracy, and social capital through
   dialogue that is supported by means of computer mediated-communication
   tools; and include challenges, puzzles or quests, which form the core
   of the learning process, where access to explicit knowledge.
   conversations, and reflection results in the construction of tacit
   knowledge. It is argued that the GOM version 11 can be used not only to
   support the development of educational computer games but to provide a
   mechanism to evaluate the use of computer games in the classroom.

ID STUDENTS
AB This paper reports on degrees of awareness and use of specific
   metacognitive strategies by 16 students in a final-year high school
   biology class in New Zealand. The aims of the intervention were to
   broaden students' thinking about bioethical issues associated with
   cancer and to enhance students' use of metacognition. Cues and prompts
   were used in this unit of work to help students use metacognitive
   strategies since students did not generally use metacognitive
   strategies spontaneously. Scaffolding was mediated through the teacher
   modelling, questioning, cueing or prompting students to evaluate their
   learning. The research reported here illustrates how teachers can cue
   students to be more self-directed in their learning. Three case studies
   illustrate how learning strategies were used differentially. Most
   students were aware of strategies that could help them to learn more
   effectively. It was found that those students who were not only aware
   of but also used strategies to plan, monitor and evaluate their work,
   produced essays of higher quality.

AB The importance of argumentation in science education is outlined and
   the relatively low level of argumentation typically observed in
   classrooms in the UK is noted, along with possible reasons for this.
   The research sets out to determine the extent to which primary school
   pupils engage in argumentation and to characterise their arguments in
   primary science lessons. A provisional framework is developed for
   analysing argumentation in this setting. Transcripts of pupils arguing
   are used to illustrate how pupils co-construct arguments without
   teacher intervention or guidance. A number of factors which appear to
   influence argumentation are noted.

AB The products of modern biotechnology processes such as genetic
   engineering, DNA testing and cloning will increasingly impact on
   society. It is essential that young people have a well-developed
   scientific understanding of biotechnology and associated processes so
   that they are able to contribute to public debate and make informed
   personal decisions. The aim of this study was to examine the
   development of understandings and attitudes about biotechnology
   processes as students progress through high school. In a
   cross-sectional case study, data was obtained from student interviews
   and written surveys of students aged 12 to 17 years. The results
   indicate that students' ability to provide a generally accepted
   definition and examples of biotechnology, cloning and genetically
   modified foods was relatively poor amongst 12-13 year old students but
   improved in older students. Most students approved of the use of
   biotechnology processes involving micro-organisms, plants and humans
   and disapproved of the use of animals. Overall, 12-13 year old
   students' attitudes were less favourable than older students regardless
   of the context. An awareness of the development and range of students'
   understandings and attitudes may lead to a more appropriate use of
   biotechnology curriculum materials and thus improved biotechnology
   education in schools.

ID SCIENCE-EDUCATION; CLASSROOMS; KNOWLEDGE; PEDAGOGY; INQUIRY
AB With the growing emphasis on the development of scientific inquiry
   skills, there is a strong need for more research on students' ability
   to collect and interpret evidence. This paper calls attention to the
   notion of evidentiary competence that refers to the concepts and
   reasoning skills involved in the collection, organization, and
   interpretation of data. We proposed a set of concepts and skills
   involved in evidentiary competence and examined sixth of them-the
   priority, relevancy, objectivity, replicability of evidence, and the
   interpretation of examples and tables-using a written instrument
   contextualized in atmospheric science. Analyses of 40 sixth grade
   students' answers and explanations revealed that their understanding of
   scientific evidence and the data collection process was quite weak in
   several respects. For example, many students neither appreciated the
   role of empirical evidence in scientific inquiry, nor distinguished
   relevant evidence from irrelevant evidence, nor understood the
   importance of reliable and objective observations, nor interpreted
   examples and tables appropriately. Results suggest that more explicit
   instructions are needed in order to strengthen students' ability to
   collect and interpret data, especially in the current data rich
   information age.

AB Gestures are a significant part of communication and carry particular

   how gestures and utterances are used as resources in the interaction
   between children and preschool teachers when creating stories with the
   computer. The data consists of observations of 17 preschool teachers
   and 34 children who are engaged in making stories. The interaction
   between the child, the preschool teacher, and the computer has been
   documented on videotape and analysed by Interaction Analysis. The
   results show the preschool teachers' decisive significance as an
   interplay partner for the child's appropriation of a linguistic
   capacity outside of a here-and-now situation. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

ID INSTRUCTION
AB This paper addresses the use of scaffolding in learning contexts that
   incorporate technologically based novel problems. We suggest that in
   computer contexts extended conceptualisations of scaffolding are needed
   in order to gain greater insights into teaching and learning processes.
   Our work has revealed that traditional forms of scaffolding, based on
   the "expert's" view of how the problem should be solved, need to be
   modified in order to accommodate the child's perspective and that three
   different types of scaffolding which we refer to as cognitive,
   technical and affective can be conceptualized. This paper discusses the
   ways in which the performance of pairs of children is enhanced in such
   scaffolding contexts, to include more examples of metastrategic
   processes and strategies for problem-solving, than when the pairs are
   left to spontaneously solve the problems. This study provides
   additional support that cognitive, affective and technical scaffolding
   are beneficial for learning and that children are able to support each
   others learning via sharing strategies and articulating the reasons
   behind them to each other. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of the present study was to examine how college students'
   help seeking behavior varied across different instructional learning
   environments. Four hundred and seventy four (N = 472) students enrolled
   in distance, distributed, and traditional classes were queried about
   their help seeking preferences, help seeking tendencies, personal
   threat in seeking help, and academic self-efficacy. It was hypothesized
   that students enrolled in courses with an online computer component
   would report (a) higher instances of help seeking behavior,
   particularly from instructors; and (b) feel less threatened to seek
   help than students in traditional learning environments. It was also
   expected that student achievement would be significantly correlated
   with formal help seeking, academic self-efficacy, and perceived threat
   to seek help. Lastly, it was postulated that students would report that
   they prefer to use electronic means to seek help and that they find it
   more effective. Overall the hypotheses of this study were supported.
   Educational implications and recommendations are provided regarding the
   type of technological tools that college instructors might consider
   using in their courses to promote help seeking. (C) 2005 Published by

AB Teaching programming concepts in a more object-oriented way is a
   growing trend in Computer Science education. This paper takes the idea
   of abstraction-first teaching a step further, by using Bloom's Taxonomy
   to design a course to present factual content early, followed by
   higher-level cognitive skills. In the course described here, factual
   content was covered rapidly, then reinforced by assignments, laboratory
   sessions and tutorials, aimed at building higher cognitive skills. The
   resulting course was successful in relatively rapidly bringing a class
   doing a "bridging" diploma up to the level required for dealing with a
   second-year course. As compared with previous runs of the diploma where
   much more time was spent in preparation for advanced courses, the class
   using the new approach performed better, suggesting that the approach
   used is worthy of further study. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This paper describes how SWoRD (scaffolded writing and rewriting in the
   discipline), a web-based reciprocal peer review system, supports
   writing practice, particularly for large content courses in which
   writing is considered critical but not feasibly included. To help
   students gain content knowledge as well as writing and reviewing
   skills, SWoRD supports the whole cycle of writing, reviews,
   back-reviews, and rewriting by scaffolding the journal publication
   process as its authentic practice model. In addition, SWoRD includes
   algorithms that compute individual reviewer's review accuracy, which is
   in turn used to support the various drawbacks of reciprocal peer
   reviews (e.g., variation in motivation or ability of reviewers).
   Finally, this paper describes an empirical evaluation showing that the
   SWoRD approach is effective in improving writing quality in content
   classes. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the effects of message constraints and labels on
   collaborative argumentation in asynchronous online discussions.
   Thirty-eight undergraduate students in an introductory educational
   technology course were assigned to one of three groups. In one group,
   students posted specific types of messages using a prescribed set of
   message categories such as argument, evidence, critique, and
   explanation. Using the same message categories, another group inserted
   message labels directly into the subject headings to identify each
   message by category and increase the visibility of the arguments and
   challenges presented in debates. A control group received none of the
   above instructions and constraints. Students in the
   constraints-with-labels group were significantly less likely to (a)
   challenge other students, and (b) respond to challenges from other
   students. The label used to identify critiques might have discouraged
   students from posting critiques and shifted attention to posting more
   arguments, following up explanations with more explanations, and
   evidence with more evidence. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Obesity and chronic disease risk factors are rising among youth. The
   Internet offers promise as a channel for delivering behavior change
   programs in a manner that is both available and accessible. This
   manuscript describes how theory informed the development of an
   Internet-based program promoting the maintenance of healthy eating and
   physical activity (PA) behaviors to 8-year-old African American girls.
   The web site was designed using a theoretical framework comprised of
   Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and the Elaboration Likelihood Model
   (ELM). Program content was developed to target mediating variables
   derived from SCT, whereas the delivery channel was designed to enhance
   central processing, a concept derived from ELM. This manuscript is
   important because interactive multimedia provides a promising medium
   for attracting and maintaining youth's attention, thereby enhancing the
   opportunity for behavior change to occur. Such interventions can
   incorporate state of the art theory-based procedures, effect behavior
   change, and provide opportunities to test theoretical constructs and
   procedures.
   Further, it demonstrates that theory-based behavior change programs can
   be developed and delivered over the Internet with expectations of
   success. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

LA English

DE interactive learning environments; teaching/learning strategies;

AB This paper reports on an evaluation of Net-Detectives, a creative
   online role play activity aimed at 9-12 year olds. Net-Detectives forms
   part of Kidsmart, an Internet awareness programme aimed at school
   children. It was evaluated through a multiple method data collection
   using questionnaire surveys, follow up telephone inter-views with
   teachers and observation in use in three UK schools during the summer
   term of 2003.
   All sources of data collected agreed that a number of benefits arise
   from participation in the Net-Detectives online role play. The pupils
   learned about Internet safety in a motivating and challenging
   environment. They empathised with others gaining an understanding of
   their motivations and practiced the ICT skills being taught. They
   particularly enjoyed being 'detectives' and interacting with others
   outside their school.
   However, the role of the 'hosts' in preparing participants and in
   moderating their communication is key to the success of the online role
   play. This preparation needs to be thoroughly planned for both the
   teachers whose classes are participating and for their pupils as
   uncertainty leads to extra communication that interferes with the
   smooth running of the role play exercise. It was very clear that first
   the technical issues have to be resolved and then, issues to do with
   the learner's comprehension and expectations of the task, before social
   interaction online can result in learning.
   The paper concludes by presenting the recommendations suggested by this
   study for hosting an online role play in the school environment. (C)

DE teacher education; pedagogical beliefs; constructivist learning

AB It is a challenge for teacher educators to shift pre-service teachers
   away from traditional pedagogical beliefs towards constructivist ones.
   At the National Institute of Education in Singapore, microLESSONS is
   introduced into the instructional technology course of the teacher
   education program to provide pre-service teachers with opportunities to
   adopt constructivist instructional approaches towards the design of
   multimedia learning packages. Based on a class of pre-service teachers
   in the Diploma in Education program, this paper examines how
   participation in the microLESSONS series changes pre-service teachers'
   pedagogical beliefs. Although the study shows that the beliefs of
   pre-service teachers are resistant to change and are unlikely to be
   affected by a short, one-off constructivist-based practical experience
   provided by the microLESSONS series, the series may have enhanced their

AB Adapting training methods to specific teacher traits to best facilitate
   the training effects for preservice teachers is an important, yet
   neglected, topic in aptitude-treatment interaction research. This study
   investigated interactions between four personal traits
   (CT-dispositions, thinking styles, CT-skills, and intrapersonal
   intelligence) and two designed treatments on preservice teachers'
   behavior change during a computer-simulated teaching experience. One
   hundred and seventy-eight preservice teachers participated in this
   study. The CS-TGCTS simulation program was employed to measure the
   preservice teachers' actual use of effective teacher behaviors, as well
   as the four targeted personal traits which were measured by three
   Likert-scale inventories and one multiple-choice test. The results
   suggest that preservice teachers with high levels of CT-dispositions,
   CT-skills, and intrapersonal intelligence - as well as those with
   judicial or legislative thinking styles - are mindful, analytical, and
   reflective in their teaching practices and therefore more likely to
   continually improve their teaching skills. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Based on the findings from reviewing 32 textbooks in the past four
   years for Taiwan's Ministry of Education, we have identified common
   problems in the reviewed textbooks and analyzed their inadequacies.
   Typical problems include the Wintel bias, too much coverage of software
   application tools and too little of computer science concepts, too many
   technical terms, meaningless analogies and examples, lack of
   supplementary materials, and inadequate treatment of
   programming-related content. The discussion about each problem is
   substantiated with examples, and suggestions are made on possible
   improvement. This analysis should help textbook writers avoid
   undesirable elements in their books and help high school computer
   teachers select higher quality books for their students. (C) 2005

AB In this paper, we synthesize two bodies of work related to students'
   representational activities: the notions of meta-representational
   competence and representation as a form of practice. We report on video
   analyses of kindergarten and first-grade students as they create
   representations of pollination in a science classroom, as well as
   summarize results from interviews regarding the design choices that
   they made. Analysis of the semistructured pre- and postinterviews
   reveals that students attend to the content domain, local activity, and
   their personal preferences when evaluating representations. Analysis of
   video case studies that followed the students as they created their
   representations further reveals several key mediators of the students'
   representational activities, including other students, task
   constraints, the teacher, and local norms for what constituted a "good
   representation." In addition, the data show that these norms shifted
   over time as new content was covered in the class, and were
   appropriated in interaction with other students. Finally, both sets of
   analyses reveal that students often face competing constraints when
   creating their representations, and resolve these constraints through a
   complex set of negotiations. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID RESEARCH EXPERIENCE; PERCEPTIONS; WORK
AB In this ethnographic study of summer undergraduate research (UR)
   experiences at four liberal arts colleges, where faculty and students
   work collaboratively on a project of mutual interest in an
   apprenticeship of authentic science research work, analysis of the
   accounts of faculty and student participants yields comparative
   insights into the structural elements of this form of UR program and
   its benefits for students. Comparison of the perspectives of faculty
   and their students revealed considerable agreement on the nature,
   range, and extent of students' UR gains. Specific student gains
   relating to the process of "becoming a scientist" were described and
   illustrated by both groups. Faculty framed these gains as part of
   professional socialization into the sciences. In contrast, students
   emphasized their personal and intellectual development, with little
   awareness of their socialization into professional practice. Viewing
   study findings through the lens of social constructivist learning
   theories demonstrates that the characteristics of these UR programs,
   how faculty practice UR in these colleges, and students'
   outcomes-including cognitive and personal growth and the development of
   a professional identity-strongly exemplify many facets of these
   theories, particularly, student-centered and situated learning as part
   of cognitive apprenticeship in a community of practice. (c) 2006 Wiley

TI Learning in a personal context: Levels of choice in a free choice
   learning environment in science and natural history museums
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The study aims to characterize contextual teaming during class visits
   to science and natural history museums. Based on previous studies, we
   assumed that "outdoor" learning is different from classroom-based
   learning, and free choice learning in the museums enhances the
   expression of learning in personal context. We studied about 750
   students participating in class visits at four museums, focusing on the
   levels of choice provided through the activity. The museums were of
   different sizes, locations, visitor number, and foci. A
   descriptive-interpretative approach was adopted, with data sources
   comprising observations, semistructured interviews with students, and
   museum worksheets. Analysis of the museum activities has yielded four
   levels of choice that affect learning from no choice to free choice
   activities. The effectiveness of teaming was examined as well by
   looking at task behavior, linkage to the students' prior knowledge and
   their school's science curriculum, and linkage to the students' life
   and experience. Our findings indicate that activities of limited choice
   offered scaffolding, allowed the students to control their learning,
   and enhanced deeper engagement in the teaming process. Within all the
   choice opportunities, the students connected the visit to their own
   life experiences and to their prior knowledge, even when the guided
   activity scarcely addressed it. Critical responses were obtained mainly
   when the museum environment allows a variety of learning opportunities
   without directing the students. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI On performing concepts during science lectures
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENTIFIC LANGUAGE; GESTURES; LEARN
AB When lecturing, teachers make use of both verbal and nonverbal
   communication. What is called teaching, therefore, involves not only
   the words and sentences a teacher utters and writes on the board during
   a lesson, but also all the hands/arms gestures, body movements, and
   facial expressions a teacher Performs in the classroom. All of these
   communicative modalities constitute resources that are made available
   to students for making sense of and learning from lectures. Yet in the
   literature on teaching science, these other means of communication are
   little investigated and understood-and, correspondingly, they are
   undertheorized. The purpose of this position paper is to argue for a
   different view of concepts in lectures: they are performed
   simultaneously drawing on and producing multiple resources that are
   different expressions of the same holistic meaning unit. To support our
   point, we provide examples from a database of 26 lectures in a
   12th-grade biology class, where the human body was the main topic of
   study. We analyze how different types of resources-including verbal and
   nonverbal discourse and various material artifacts-interact during
   lectures. We provide evidence for the unified production of these
   various sense-making resources during teaching to constitute a meaning
   unit, and we emphasize particularly the use of gestures and body
   orientations inside this meaning unit. We suggest that proper analyses
   of meaning units need to take into account not only language and
   diagrams but also a lecturer's pointing and depicting gestures, body
   positions, and the relationships between these different modalities.
   Scientific knowledge (conceptions) exists in the concurrent display of
   all sense-making resources, which we, following Vygotsky, understand as
   forming a unit (identity) of nonidentical entities. (c) 2006 Wiley

SO SCIENCE EDUCATION

DT Article
ID SCHOOL SCIENCE; LEARNING-DISABILITIES; EDUCATION; ACQUISITION
AB Wenger's (1998) concepts "community of practice," "brokering," and
   "transfer" explain the challenges co-operative (co-op) education
   students face in relating the knowledge learned in school with what
   they learn while participating as members of a workplace. The research
   for this paper is set within the contexts of the knowledge economy and
   increased collaboration in the workplace. The paper draws on several
   qualitative studies of work-based education to examine the similarities
   and differences between learning in the workplace and learning in
   school, with a focus on science education and science-rich workplaces.
   Barriers to connecting school knowledge and workplace knowledge include
   the nature of science (its purpose, accountability, and substance), the
   structure of knowledge in each setting, the form content knowledge
   takes, the sequence that the curriculum is presented in, and the
   gatekeeping that occurs when knowledge is accessed. The paper addresses
   implications for interventions in school and the workplace, with
   attention to the transition from school to work, and concludes by
   pointing to profound obstacles to connecting school knowledge with
   workplace knowledge. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English

ID SCIENCE; INQUIRY; KNOWLEDGE; TEACHERS; COMMUNITIES; STUDENTS; VIEWS
AB Reform efforts in science education have focused on engaging students
   in authentic scientific practices. For these efforts to succeed,
   detailed articulations of scientific practice need to be linked to
   understandings of classroom practice. Here we characterize engagement
   in practice generally in terms of "3Rs": routines, roles, and
   responsibilities. We argue that there is a misalignment between the 3Rs
   of scientific practice and the practices common in classrooms, and that
   this misalignment poses a considerable obstacle for beginning teachers
   who attempt to implement reform pedagogy. As part of a secondary
   methods course, 16 preservice teachers (PSTs) participated in two
   exemplar activities designed to engage them in scientific practices.
   The PST performances suggest that at least initially, they did not
   consider authentic scientific practices appropriate for classroom
   activities, implying a pedagogical repertoire dominated by the 3Rs of
   traditional classrooms. PST performances, however, evidenced a shift in
   the 3Rs from those common in classrooms to those required by these
   activities, suggesting that their visions for classrooms are malleable,
   and underlining the importance of aligning the 3Rs of scientific and
   classroom practices during teacher preparation. (c) 2006 Wiley

AB This paper presents results from a study aimed at helping preservice

   the authors studied the effect of using a guided inquiry and modeling
   instructional framework (EIMA) and accompanying science methods

   skills, scientific model use, and teaching orientations. Analysis of
   preservice teachers' pre-posttests, classroom artifacts, peer

   framework successfully built on preservice teachers' prior
   instructional ideas, and that the majority of preservice teachers
   learned and used the framework in their lesson plans and teaching.
   Additionally, analysis of pre-posttest differences indicates an
   increase in posttest lesson plans that focused on engaging students in
   scientific inquiry using several kinds of models. Most importantly, the
   framework and accompanying instruction enabled two thirds of the class
   to move their teaching orientations away from discovery or didactic
   approaches toward reform-based approaches such as conceptual change,
   inquiry, and guided inquiry. Results from this study show that using
   instructional frameworks such as EIMA can enable preservice teachers to
   socially construct, synthesize, and apply their knowledge for enacting
   reform-oriented science teaching approaches such as model-centered
   scientific inquiry. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Flexibility in macro-scripts for computer-supported collaborative
   learning
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE collaborative learning; computational model; flexibility; scripts
AB In the field of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL),
   scripts are designed to support collaboration among distant learners or
   co-present learners whose interactions are (at least partially)
   mediated by a computer. The rationale of scripts is to structure
   collaborative learning processes in order to trigger group interactions
   that may be rare in free collaboration. Fixing the degree of coercion
   is a delicate design choice: too rigid scripts would spoil the richness
   of collaborative interactions; too flexible scripts would fail to
   induce the targeted interactions. Because of the unpredictability of
   how scripts will be enacted, both the teacher and the students must be
   allowed to modify some script features. In this article we propose a
   conceptual analysis of this notion of flexibility, arguing for a
   dissociation of constraints that are intrinsic to the pedagogical
   design of the script and constraints induced by the technology or
   contextual factors. This difference sets up the limits of flexibility
   both for the teacher and for the students and provides specification
   for the computational design. This analysis leads to the conclusion
   that the operationalization of CSCL scripts should be addressed by
   implementing script engines handling multiple representations of the
   script: the script to be executed, the emergent organization of teams,
   the set of intrinsic and extrinsic constraints and the visual
   representation of the script for students and teachers.

TI Guided interaction in pre-school settings
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE children; interaction; learning; pre-school; technology
ID COMMUNITIES; TOOLS
AB The aim of this study was to explore how guided interaction could
   create opportunities for learning with information and communication
   technologies (ICT) for children aged three and four. The study was
   grounded in the naturalistic environment of the playroom, in a context
   of free play and child-initiated activity, and focused on interventions
   selected and implemented by practitioners. Guided interaction describes
   the ways in which children's interactions with computers and other
   forms of ICT can be actively supported in pre-school settings. The
   paper presents a framework that illustrates proximal and distal guided
   interaction and the modes by which they are enacted. The concept of
   guided interaction (i) provides a tool for thinking about the different
   modes by which learning can be supported in pre-school settings and
   (ii) helps practitioners to articulate, reflect on and legitimise
   changes in pedagogy, enabling them to find new approaches to working
   with ICT. The paper provides an account of the analysis underpinning
   the development of the concept, followed by a description of its
   characteristics and the different types of learning that can be
   supported. An adapted version of this analytical framework has
   potential both as a research tool and to support changes in practice
   for professionals in other sectors of education.

AB This paper describes the development of an adaptive assessment called
   Interactive Computerised Assessment System (InCAS) that is aimed at
   children of a wide age and ability range to identify specific reading
   problems. Rasch measurement has been used to create the equal interval
   scales that form each part of the assessment. The rationale for the
   structure and content of InCAS is discussed and then different formats
   of feedback supplied to teachers are explained. This feedback is
   accompanied by research-based strategies for remediation, following the
   principle of 'assessment for learning', which promotes the provision of
   feedback on how to improve.

ID MEDIA
AB The purpose of this study was to explore the potential of annotation
   and communication software (eFuzion) developed for the improvement of
   students' learning and to determine the effectiveness of the software.
   eFuzion is designed to be useful in a significantly large classroom by
   allowing instructors and teaching assistants to provide immediate
   responses to students' questions and to provide a broader array of
   options for the lucid presentation of complex concepts. To determine
   the effectiveness of the software, two groups that took the same course
   were compared in terms of their learning scores, one group having used
   the software, the other having not used it. In the three measures of
   learning, the students who used the software showed significantly
   higher learning scores than students who did not use it. In addition,
   students indicated that they felt closer to the instructor and that
   their understanding of the lecture material was increased by using the
   software. The results imply that the software has great potential for
   improving students' learning when it is appropriately used and free of
   technical difficulties.

   DECADE
AB Research has demonstrated girls to outperform boys on conventional
   literacy tests. The present studies concern gender differences on
   computerised educational tests. Seventy-one children were tested using
   LASS Secondary and a set of seven conventional measures. No significant
   gender differences were found on any of the LASS Secondary modules,
   although females did outperform males on a conventional spelling test.
   A further 126 pupils were tested on computerised and paper versions of
   the LASS Secondary reading, spelling and reasoning modules. No gender
   differences were found on the computerised versions, but there were
   significant differences on the paper versions of the reading and
   spelling modules favouring females. In a third study, 45 children were
   administered computerised and paper versions of the LASS Junior reading
   and spelling modules. There were no significant differences on the
   computerised modules, but girls performed significantly higher than
   boys on the paper version of the spelling module. It is possible that
   computerised assessment does not detect the established gender effect
   due to differences between males and females in motivation, computer
   experience and competitiveness. Further large-scale studies are
   necessary to confirm these findings.

TI Characteristics of drills related to development of skills
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE elementary education; evaluation of CAL systems; media in education
AB It is important for the teacher to choose effective software for
   students. It is also important for designers to know what features of
   educational software make it effective. But the results of studies
   dealing with the effectiveness of educational software are
   contradictory. One reason for such results might be the fact that
   meta-analysis covers different kinds of educational software,
   simulations and drills for example, but it is hard to compare them.
   Another reason might be that the conditions (instruments, subjects,
   etc.) of the various studies were different. A third possibility might
   be that a particular type of educational software could consist of both
   good and bad characteristics. Therefore, research is needed on the
   characteristics of educational software. This type of study focuses on
   a particular kind of educational software, and this article is about
   the findings of one such study, exploring the characteristics and the
   effectiveness of drills in Estonian elementary schools. Sixteen
   characteristics of drills that had statistically significant
   correlation with student learning, and the influence of these
   characteristics are discussed as the results of this study. The results
   indicated that characteristics related to feedback, presentation of
   information and questions are the most critical evaluating quality of
   drills and in designing such educational software.

AB Recent work on applying semantic technologies to learning has
   concentrated on providing novel means of accessing and making use of
   learning objects. However, this is unnecessarily limiting: semantic
   technologies will make it possible to develop a range of educational
   Semantic Web services, such as interpretation, structure-visualization,
   support for argumentation, novel forms of content customization, novel
   mechanisms for aggregating learning material, citation services and so
   on. In this paper, we outline an initial framework that extends the use
   of semantic technologies as a means of providing learning services that
   are owned and created by learning communities.

ID MOTIVATIONAL MODEL; NEGATIVE AFFECT; HIGH-SCHOOL; ANXIETY
AB Translation of questionnaire instruments to digital administration
   systems, both self-contained and web-based, is widespread and
   increasing daily. However, the literature is lean on controlled
   empirical studies investigating the potential for differential effects
   of administrative methods. In this study, two university student
   samples were administered 16 questionnaires across three separate
   administration conditions: paper-based, computer-based and web-based.
   Outcomes of interest included data quality and participant affect.
   Overall, few differences in data quality were observed between
   administration conditions despite some evidence in favour of
   paper-based administration (PBA) over the other two. Affective
   responses of participants favoured the PBA over web- and computer-based
   administrations. Implications for research use of digital systems for
   data collection are discussed.

AB Sixty-six English-speaking postgraduate distance-education medical
   students completed the Learning Styles Questionnaire (LSQ: 40-item
   version). This was completed while attending a residential workshop at
   the beginning of the semester, and 44 of these students completed the
   same LSQ questionnaire 5 months later at the completion of the
   semester. The psychometric properties of the LSQ were assessed using
   Cronbach's alpha (internal consistency), test-retest, correlational
   analyses and factor analysis. The results indicated that the LSQ
   (40-item version) has poor reliability and validity, and therefore
   requires further development and psychometric evaluation.

TI Aim, shoot, ready! Future teachers learn to 'do' video
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes an intensive 2-hr workshop designed to introduce
   preservice teachers to digital video in the context of an instructional
   technology course or as a stand-alone activity. Acknowledging time
   constraints in most real-life instructional situations, this format
   takes novices with no or very limited knowledge of video making to the
   point where they have experienced most of the steps involved in
   crafting a finished (though almost certainly unpolished) digital video.
   Conversations introduce project-based collaborative learning as the
   pedagogical context for digital video production, the value of
   supporting a sense of creativity in students to promote deeper
   engagement with subject matter through hands-on activities, and how to
   involve a variety of learning modalities as opposed to predominantly
   passive reading and listening. Possible extensions like time-lapsed
   video are discussed.

TI E-learning funding for schools: a policy paradox?
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID EDUCATION POLICY
AB The rise in UK government funding for information and communications
   technologies (ICTs) since 1997 has created a large capital
   infrastructure, which schools are required to support with their own
   funds. Simultaneously, both nationally and internationally, the model
   of self-managing schools gathers momentum. In the UK, the government
   supports the key principle of local management of schools, which points
   towards the leadership team and governors as the body best placed to
   make decisions on how funding will support school improvement. The
   complexity of policy formation with respect to e-learning funding in
   schools is further compounded by the requirement to address the needs
   of a range of stakeholders in the state and commercial sectors.
   This goal of this paper was to explore this potential paradox between
   centralised funding of school ICTs and local planning and
   decision-making. Five possible funding policy models were suggested and
   discussed, and key questions in relation to policy formation were
   identified.

TI Faculty adoption behaviour about web-based distance education: a case
   study from China Agricultural University
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of this study was to determine China Agricultural
   University's (CAU's) faculty adoption behaviour about web-based
   distance education (WBDE). Rogers' (2003) model of five stages in the
   innovation-decision process was adopted and modified as the theoretical
   base for the study. Quantitative research was employed and the research
   design for the study was descriptive in nature. The results of data
   analysis found that about 70% of participating CAU faculty (N= 273)
   stayed in early stages in the innovation-decision process related to
   WBDE (no knowledge, knowledge, or persuasion) and about 30% were in
   later stages (decision, implementation and confirmation). Faculty
   members' stage in the innovation-decision process differed
   significantly by their professional area, level of education, teaching
   experience and distance education experience. Gender, age and academic
   rank had no significant influence on faculty members' stage in the
   process.

TI Perils and promises: University instructors' integration of technology
   in classroom-based practices
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID HIGHER-EDUCATION
AB Modern technologies such as the Internet present new opportunities for
   teaching and learning at all educational levels. Today, many
   universities strive to integrate appropriate technologies into campus
   classrooms. Despite sizeable investments in hardware, software and
   supporting infrastructures, little is known about implementation. The
   purpose of this study was to examine college-level instructors' use of
   and attitudes towards classroom-based teaching technologies. The
   methodological design relied on qualitative measures through the use of
   two data collection methods, survey and interview. The research site
   was a large, public university in the United States. Findings revealed
   trends in current and future technology use, the positive influence of
   technology on teaching and learning, and significant barriers to
   technology use that resulted in practical recommendations for
   leveraging available resources towards the support of classroom-based
   technologies. This study not only advances the knowledge base regarding
   the use of classroom-based technologies in higher education but also
   serves as a practical resource for guiding future instructional
   technology practices on college campuses.

TI The Virtual Lecture Hall: utilisation, effectiveness and student
   perceptions
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID MULTIMEDIA; EDUCATION
AB We presently introduce the Virtual Lecture Hall (VLH), an instructional
   computer-based platform for delivering Microsoft PowerPoint slides
   threaded with audio clips for later review. There were 839 male and
   female university students enrolled in an introductory psychology class
   who had access to review class lectures via the VLH. This tool was made
   available through the course website following the first midterm.
   Approximately 20% used the resource, and 18% completed a five-item
   survey tapping their perceptions of whether the VLH enhanced learning
   or increased grades; and whether they wanted the resource in other
   courses. The total number of student accesses was calculated, as was
   the total duration (in minutes) that students used the VLH. After
   accounting for initial midterm test score differences, results showed
   that students who used the VLH for 100 minutes or more scored, on
   average, 15% higher in their second midterm. The student perceptions of
   the VLH were also highly favourable. Directions for future research in
   resource development and implications for educators are also discussed.

TI Demand-led e-learning and the elusive total solution
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Demand-led learning offers resources to learners when they want them;
   total solution learning takes the learner from induction to final
   accreditation through a seamless process. The University of Southampton
   attempted to deliver basic information technology skills through the
   support of these processes. Steps in the seamless process were
   designed, developed and implemented. Face-to-face intervention was
   eliminated, apart from initial learner induction and online-test
   invigilation. Feedback loops were planned so that success (eg, in
   completing the accreditation) might encourage further success through
   collaborative and competitive peer learning. Critical dependency issues
   arose whilst implementing the solution. When learning delivery was
   disrupted by systems failure, the indirect effects on learner
   motivation and resourcefulness proved as damaging as system breaks
   themselves. This made the institutionalisation of the learning elusive,
   but key areas have been identified for further investigation.

TI Quality assurance in online education: The Universitas 21 Global
   approach
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Despite the proliferation of online education, concerns remain about
   the quality of online programmes. Quality assurance (QA) has become a
   prominent issue, not only for educational institutions and accreditors,
   but also for students and employers alike. This paper describes some of
   the rather unique QA processes used at Universitas 21 Global (U21G),
   one of the new breed of online academic institutions, and its relation
   to U21pedagogica, the independent agency that approves U21G's
   programmes. These distinctive QA processes relate to five main areas,
   namely, content authoring, courseware development, adjunct faculty
   recruitment, pedagogy and delivery. The authors believe that these QA
   processes have contributed significantly to student satisfaction and
   student retention at U21G. Furthermore, these QA processes can also be
   adapted to suit more traditional 'brick-and-mortar' universities
   offering online programmes.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the experiences of three
   science teachers attempting to transform their practice by conducting
   action research on feminist science teaching. The teachers engaged in
   systematic, self-critical inquiry of their own practice and joined 8
   other science teachers to engage in collaborative conversations about
   the nature of science, science teaching, and science education as a way
   of coming to a better understanding of how science can be taught for a
   more diverse group of students. Data were gathered via semistructured
   interviews, whole-group discussions, classroom observations, and review
   of supporting documents. Data analysis was based on narrative inquiry,
   where particular attention was given to the construction and
   reconstruction of the teachers' stories of their practical inquiries.
   Results indicated that the teachers as researchers of their own
   practice gained new knowledge about feminist science teaching and,
   furthermore, generated a cluster of pedagogical possibilities for
   inclusive, dynamic science teaching. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

ID EDUCATION
AB This study explores the relationship between interaction rituals,
   student engagement with science, and learning environments modeled on
   communities of practice based on an ethnographic study of an eighth
   grade urban magnet school classroom. It compares three interactional
   events in order to examine the classroom conditions and teacher
   practices that can foster successful interaction rituals (IRs), which
   are characterized by high levels of emotional energy, feelings of group
   membership, and sustained interest in the subject. Classroom conditions
   surrounding the emergence of successful IRs included mutual focus,
   familiar symbols and activity structures, the permissibility of some
   side-talk, and opportunities for physical and emotional entrainment.
   Sustained interest in the topic beyond the duration of the IR and an
   increase in students' helping each other learn occurred more frequently
   when the mutual focus consisted of science-related symbols, when there
   were low levels of risk for participants, when activities involved
   sufficient challenge and time, and when students were positioned as
   knowledgeable and competent in science. The results suggest that
   successful interaction rituals can foster student engagement with
   topics that may not have previously held interest and can contribute to
   students' support of peers' learning, thereby moving the classroom
   toward a community-of-practice model. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING

ID DISCOURSE; FEEDBACK; SCIENCE
AB This study explores teachers' informal formative assessment practices
   in three middle school science classrooms. We present a model for
   examining these practices based on three components of formative
   assessment (eliciting, recognizing, and using information) and the
   three domains linked to scientific inquiry (epistemic frameworks,
   conceptual structures, and social processes). We describe the informal
   assessment practices as ESRU cycles-the teacher Elicits a question; the
   Student responds; the teacher Recognizes the student's response; and
   then Uses the information collected to support student learning. By
   tracking the strategies teachers used in terms of ESRU cycles, we were
   able to capture differences in assessment practices across the three
   teachers during the implementation of four investigations of a physical
   science unit on buoyancy. Furthermore, based on information collected
   in a three-question embedded assessment administered to assess
   students' learning, we linked students' level of performance to the
   teachers' informal assessment practices. We found that the teacher who
   more frequently used complete ESRU cycles had students with higher
   performance on the embedded assessment as compared with the other two
   teachers. We conclude that the ESRU model is a useful way of capturing
   differences in teachers' informal assessment practices. Furthermore,
   the study suggests that effective informal formative assessment
   practices may be associated with student learning in scientific inquiry
   classrooms. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 44: 57-84,

AB Numerous studies have documented the infrequent use of learner-centered
   instruction in college science and mathematics classrooms and its
   negative effects on undergraduate learning and motivation. The present
   research deepened understanding of why. Specifically, an Internet
   survey was constructed that explored obstacles, supports, and
   incentives for instructional innovation in the classroom and was sent
   out to college science and mathematics faculty of Louisiana. Results
   revealed that colleges generally were perceived to assign little or an
   indeterminate weight to instruction in personnel decision making.
   Faculty members generally have little training in pedagogy; but when
   they do, they are more likely to consult sources of instructional
   innovation and consider teaching an important part of their
   professional identities. Data concerning the most common sources of
   instructional innovation information are presented. Several suggestions
   are made for institutional reform that if enacted might contribute to
   systemic improvement in the quality of instruction undergraduates
   receive. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 44: 85-106,

ID CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; ALTERNATIVE CONCEPTIONS; INTUITIVE PHYSICS;
   CIRCUITS; SCIENCE; ELECTROSTATICS; ELECTRICITY
AB Many students in physics courses fail to achieve a desired conceptual
   change because they assign an incorrect ontology to the to-be-learned
   concept. This situation has been detected in previous research for the
   case of field lines: many college students assign material properties
   to the lines and describe them, for example, as tubes that contain or
   transport charges. The historical evolution of this concept shows that
   early scientists like Faraday assigned material properties to these
   lines in some occasions. In the present work a history-based
   instructional material was designed to foster the analysis of the
   ontology of field lines to help students at an Argentinean university
   achieve conceptual change. The predicates used by the students to
   describe physical situations were used as evidence of the assigned
   ontological status. Conceptual change was measured by the change in the
   proportion of geometrical predicates that students used when referring
   to the lines in a written questionnaire. This change was significantly
   higher for the students learning with the history-based material
   compared to those that learned in the regular class. Some
   characteristics of the material and geometrical ideas that students
   hold about the field lines were determined through an oral interview.

ID MICROWORLD; EDUCATION
AB In this article, we describe a preliminary study that integrates
   research on engineering design activities for K-12 students with work
   on microworlds as learning tools. Here, we extend these bodies of
   research by exploring whether-and how-authentic recreations of
   engineering practices can help students develop conceptual
   understanding of physics. We focus on the design-build-test (DBT) cycle
   used by professional engineers in simulation-based rapid modeling. In
   this experiment, middle-school students worked for 10 hr during a
   single weekend to solve engineering design challenges using
   SodaConstructor, a Java-based microworld, as a simulation environment.
   As a result of the experiment, students learned about center of mass.
   Our data further suggest that in the process of simulation-based
   modeling, rapid iterations of the DBT cycle progressively linked
   students' interest in the design activities and understanding of the
   concept of center of mass. We suggest that these rapid iterations of
   the DBT cycle functioned as exploratoids: short fragments of
   exploratory action in a microworld that cumulatively develop interest
   in and understanding of important scientific concepts.

AB This study investigated the impact of the use of computer technology on
   the enactment of "inquiry" in a sixth grade science classroom.
   Participants were 42 students (38% female) enrolled in two sections of
   the classroom and taught by a technology-enthusiast instructor. Data
   were collected over the course of 4 months during which several
   "inquiry" activities were completed, some of which were supported with
   the use of technology. Non-participant observation, classroom
   videotaping, and semi-structured and critical-incident interviews were
   used to collect data. The results indicated that the technology in use
   worked to restrict rather than promote "inquiry" in the participant
   classroom. In the presence of computers, group activities became more
   structured with a focus on sharing tasks and accounting for individual
   responsibility, and less time was dedicated to group discourse with a
   marked decrease in critical, meaning-making discourse. The views and
   beliefs of teachers and students in relation to their specific contexts
   moderate the potential of technology in supporting inquiry teaching and
   learning and should be factored both in teacher training and attempts
   to integrate technology in science teaching. (c) 2006 Wiley

TI Hands on what? The relative effectiveness of physical versus virtual

SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING

ID GENDER DIFFERENCES; SCIENCE; SKILLS
AB "Hands-on" activities play an important, but controversial, role in
   early science education. In this study we attempt to clarify some of
   the issues surrounding the controversy by calling attention to
   distinctions between: (a) type of instruction (direct or discovery);
   (b) type of knowledge to be acquired (domain-general or
   domain-specific); and (c) type of materials that are used (physical or
   virtual). We then describe an empirical study that investigates the
   relative effectiveness of the physical-virtual dimension. In the
   present study, seventh and eighth grade students assembled and tested
   mousetrap cars with the goal of designing a car that would go the
   farthest. Children were assigned to four different conditions,
   depending on whether they manipulated physical or virtual materials,
   and whether they had a fixed number of cars they could construct or a
   fixed amount of time in which to construct them. All four conditions
   were equally effective in producing significant gains in learners'
   knowledge about causal factors, in their ability to design optimal
   cars, and in their confidence in their knowledge. Girls' performance,
   knowledge, and effort were equal to boys' in all conditions, but girls'
   confidence remained below boys' throughout. Given the fact that, on
   several different measures, children were able to learn as well with
   virtual as with physical materials, the inherent pragmatic advantages
   of virtual materials in science may make them the preferred
   instructional medium in many hands-on contexts. (c) 2006 Wiley

AB This paper presents a number of case studies in Oceanography, an
   optional module in the third/fourth year of a Master of Science
   programme at Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The main
   objective was to gain more thorough insights into student learning by
   examining two sets of individual oral examinations. In addition, all
   students were interviewed about their intentions and behaviours when
   studying. These interviews, as well as being a useful source of
   information on learning, turned out to serve as coaching sessions as
   well. In their interviews, students revealed different learning
   approaches. The major focus of this study is directed towards the less
   successful students, who appeared to have problems in focusing on
   crucial learning issues. The authors suggest a gestalt theoretical
   model to embody support that might remedy the situation. Its main
   application has so far been within psychotherapy, but the authors argue
   that the principles can easily be applied in learning with potentially
   great benefit.

ID BIOTECHNOLOGY; CURRICULUM
AB This study is an investigation of the epistemological beliefs and study
   habits of students undertaking first-year courses in Biological
   Chemistry and Biochemistry. In particular, we were interested in the
   relationship between students' epistemological beliefs about learning
   and knowledge, approaches to learning, and achievement. The study
   adopted a mixed-methods approach in which quantitative and qualitative
   data have provided complementary insights into the beliefs and
   approaches adopted by these students. Our findings indicate that most
   students tend to adopt beliefs that knowledge and learning involves the
   accumulation of information and the capacity to reproduce on demand in
   examinations. Approaches to learning reflect these beliefs and are
   dominated by rote learning and preference for assessment by
   examination. Few students adopt strategies that emphasise the
   relationship of concepts to those already learnt or to applications
   relevant to biological science. Implications of this study for reform
   of university teaching practices as well as secondary practices are
   discussed.

AB The present work discusses, firstly, different dimensions that
   characterize the use of analogies in the classroom. Foremost among
   these are the pupil's level of activity and the degree of monitoring
   carried out by the teacher. Secondly, the routines declared by a group
   of science teachers (n = 73), when they described their classroom
   activity in using analogies, are analysed. It was found that most of
   the teachers corresponded to traditional models for the use of
   analogies, or, in the best of cases, to models based on meaningful
   learning by transmission/reception of previously elaborated knowledge.
   Finally, some implications for teaching and teacher education are
   discussed.

AB This paper is based on a study of how students' read nature in
   different ecosystems. Its focus is on ecology and the context is
   outdoors. This literacy has to do with an ability to recognise
   organisms and relate them to material cycling and energy flow in the
   specific habitat that is to be read. A teaching sequence was designed
   in order to develop a class of secondary students' ability to read
   nature in a forest ecosystem. After instruction they were taken to
   another ecosystem, a pond where they were asked to read the new
   environment. The main goal was to follow to what extent they can
   transfer their understanding from one ecosystem to another. The study
   is based on recorded interviews, field work, and classroom activities,
   and it shows the importance of learning general patterns in nature and
   relating them to functional groups of organisms in an ecosystem.

ID SCIENCE-EDUCATION; SCHOOL; WORLD; CONCEPTIONS; FAMILY
AB This paper draws on the personal experiences of three researchers: an
   "outsider" (or western-oriented) science teacher, a science teacher
   educator who has lived in Melanesian countries for almost a decade, and
   a national researcher who was born and educated in Melanesia. During a
   recent interpretative research study of the problematic relationship
   between the traditional world-views of Melanesian villagers and the
   official school science views of young Melanesian people, Bruce became
   increasingly aware of the importance of conducting culture-sensitive
   interpretative research. Bruce and Joe describe three people with
   different experiences and approaches to education. Mindful of the
   important role of the outside teacher researchers in providing
   essential information for the local contextualisation of school science
   curricula, we propose a number of culture-sensitive practices when
   working in Melanesian cross-cultural contexts.
   Karsoon: I like Melanesian ways. I wanted to learn Western ways and so
   when mission came, I went to school [so that I could] learn their ways.
   I thought I would learn new ways. I use school ways no more.
   Karsoon: The white man didn't want us to learn about his ways but only
   about his religion. (Waldrip & Taylor, 1999a, p. 297)
   I've studied overseas where I came across Papua New Guineans suffering
   from the "dry coconut syndrome" - brown on the outside, but white on
   the inside. These are the people who suddenly forget their own ways
   because they are living in another country.

AB This paper describes a complete lab work management framework designed
   and developed in the authors' department to help teachers to manage the
   small projects that students are expected to complete as lab
   assignments during their graduate-level computer engineering studies.
   The paper focuses on an application example of the framework to a
   specific lab work related to Low Level Input/Output. Special emphasis
   is laid on the most complex aspects of such environments. The
   management framework provides specific tools for dealing with these
   issues: the management of student work delivery and evaluation results
   accessibility, automatic or semi-automatic assessment of student work,
   and detection of lab assignments that are highly suspect of having been
   copied. Additionally, the lab work framework represents a method
   through which a closer peer-to-peer or one-to-many communication with
   students can be attained. The lab work described in the paper is a
   small project based on a specification document. It is designed to get
   students to gain an in-depth knowledge of the computer Input/Output
   subsystem. While the framework has been in use for over 10 years, the
   specific Input/Output lab work has been managed by the framework
   tool-chain for the last 6 years, and used by over 2000 students. The
   lab work management framework is a step towards the feasibility of a
   closer-to-the-student higher education system, where the main
   interaction between students and teachers can be based on individual or
   on small group tutorials. Using the tool-chain, the academic load of
   teachers in mass course environments can be kept at acceptable levels,
   making for higher quality education. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB To build a web-based virtual learning environment depends on
   information technologies, concerns technology supporting learning
   methods and theories. A web-based virtual online classroom is designed
   and developed based on learning theories and streaming media
   technologies. And it is composed of two parts: instructional
   communicating environment (ICE) and collaborative learning environment
   (CLE). ICE provides learners with learning materials, lecture videos,
   and interactive environment etc. CLE supports active learning by
   providing the environment with learning tools, learning materials and
   contextual discussion for learners. The environments are designed with
   event-based synchronous strategies and e-learning technologies
   standards.
   Different users have different ideas about the use of learning tools in
   the virtual classroom. According to the questionnaire, teachers are
   accustomed to communicating and teaching face to face. They hope they
   could be able to control the teaching and learning process and observe
   learners behaviors like in the traditional classroom. Learners love to
   use such tools as chat-room, BBS, etc., to control their learning pace.

AB Several studies have been conducted related to dropouts from on-campus
   and distance education courses. However, no clear definition of dropout
   from academic courses was provided. Consequently, this study proposes a
   clear and precise definition of dropout from academic courses in the
   context of e-learning courses. Additionally, it is documented in
   literature that students attending e-learning courses dropout at
   substantially higher rates than their counterparts in on-campus
   courses. Little attention has been given to the key factors associated
   with such substantial difference. This study explores two main
   constructs: (1) academic locus of control; and, (2) students'
   satisfaction with e-learning. Results show that students' satisfaction
   with e-learning is a key indicator in students' decision to dropout
   from e-learning courses. Moreover, dropout students (non-completers)
   reported to have significantly lower satisfaction with e-learning than
   students who successfully completed (completers or persistent students)
   the same e-learning courses. Additionally, results of this study show
   that the academic locus of control appears to have no impact on
   Students' decision to drop from e-learning courses. (c) 2005 Elsevier

AB A meta-analysis was performed to synthesize existing research comparing
   the effects of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) versus traditional
   instruction (TI) on students' achievement in Taiwan. Fifty-two studies
   were located from four sources, and their quantitative data was
   transformed into effect size (ES). The overall grand mean of the
   study-weighted ES for all 52 studies was 0.55. The results suggest that
   CAI is more effective than TI in Taiwan. In addition, two of the
   seventeen variables selected for this study (i.e., statistical power,
   and comparison group) had a statistically significant impact on the
   mean ES.
   The results from this study suggest that the effects of CAI in
   instruction are positive over TI. The results also shed light on the
   debate of learning from media between Clark and Kozma. (c) 2005

AB Social interactions profoundly impact the learning processes of
   learners in traditional societies. The rapid rise of the Internet using
   population has been the establishment of numerous different styles of
   network communities. Network societies form when more Internet
   communities are established, but the basic form of a network society,
   especially a network learning society, remains unclear. In 1998, a
   group of Taiwanese researchers created a network learning society,
   named "EduCities". Based on the experience of building this network
   learning society, the authors found that a structured network learning
   society architecture helps participants to coordinate and manage
   interaction processes. This study describes 10 basic elements involved
   in establishing a structured network learning society, i.e.,
   participants, shared visions, devices, services, rules, relations,
   manners, learning domains, learning goals and learning activities. A
   structured network learning society environment, "EduCities", was then
   implemented based on the structured network learning society concept.
   EduCities included numerous structural designs, including EduCity,
   EduTown, EduSisterTown, EduVillage, EduSisterVillage, EduCitizen, and
   EduHome were practiced. Participants in EduCities own their roles,
   managing power, learning goals, and social relations. The structured
   network learning society concept represents a prototype of an online
   learning society. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Web Course Tools (WehCT) have enhanced the ability and motivation of
   institutes of higher education to support e-learning. In this study, we
   extended the Technology Acceptance Model to include technical support
   as a precursor and then investigated the role of the extended model in
   user acceptance of WebCT. Responses from 836 university students were
   used to test the proposed structural model. The data showed that
   technical support has a significant direct effect on perceived ease of
   use and usefulness, while perceived ease of use and usefulness are the
   dominant factors affecting the attitude of students using WebCT. The
   results indicate the importance of perceived ease of use and perceived
   usefulness in mediating the relationship of technical support with
   attitude and WebCT usage. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO COMPUTERS & EDUCATION

AB Information Technology is developing rapidly and providing
   policy/decision makers with large amounts of information that require
   processing and analysis. Decision support systems (DSS) aim to provide
   tools that not only help such analyses, but enable the decision maker
   to experiment and simulate the effects of different policies and
   selection strategies. The specific context of this research, set in
   Saudi Arabia, is administrative decision making using large educational
   databases.
   A decision support system (DEMASS) developed to enable systematic
   exploration of the educational database, allows users to identify
   variables of interest and to actively change the attribute values
   (weightings) of these attributes thus revealing the consequences of
   these decisions on policies and selection processes. Further
   refinements allow users to introduce conditional rules which take into
   account other variables required by, for example, local circumstances.
   An active Document Manager, used in conjunction with DEMASS, allows
   decision makers to manipulate the structure of the document in which
   the decision making interactions have been placed. Two initial
   validation studies were undertaken with realistic tasks using regional
   decision/policy makers and their educational databases. These
   demonstrated the benefits of the support facilities in enabling
   policy/decision making to be more differentiated, responsive to local
   requirements, and open to collaborative working. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Mathematics and Technology Attitudes Scale (MTAS) is a simple scale
   for middle secondary years students that monitors five affective
   variables relevant to learning mathematics with technology. The
   subscales measure mathematics confidence, confidence with technology,
   attitude to learning mathematics with technology and two aspects of
   engagement in learning mathematics. The paper presents a model of how
   technology use can enhance mathematics achievement, a review of other
   instruments and a psychometric analysis of the WAS. It also reports the
   responses of 350 students from 6 schools to demonstrate the power of
   the WAS to provide useful insights for teachers and researchers.
   'Attitude to learning mathematics with technology' had a wider range of
   scores than other variables studied. For boys, this attitude is
   correlated only with confidence in using technology, but for girls the
   only relationship found was a negative correlation with mathematics
   confidence. These differences need to be taken into account when
   planning instruction. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates differences in use of, and attitudes toward the
   Internet and computers generally for Chinese and British students, and
   gender differences in this cross-cultural context. Two hundred and
   twenty Chinese and 245 British students' responses to a self-report
   survey questionnaire are discussed. Significant differences were found
   in Internet experience, attitudes, usage, and self-confidence between
   Chinese and British students. British students were more likely to use
   computers for study purposes than Chinese students, but Chinese
   students were more self-confident about their advanced computer skills.
   Significant gender differences were also found in both national groups.
   Men in both countries were more likely than women to use email or
   'chat' rooms. Men played more computer games than women; Chinese men
   being the most active games players. Men in both countries were more
   self-confident about their computer skills than women, and were more
   likely to express the opinion that using computers was a male activity
   and skill than were women. Gender differences were higher in the
   British group than the Chinese group. The present study illustrates the
   continued significance of gender in students' attitudes towards, and
   use of computers, within different cultural contexts. (c) 2005 Elsevier

AB This paper presents the results of an experiment conducted to assess
   the affects of teaching recursion in two disjoint, non-consecutive
   units of instruction. One group of students was taught basic and
   advanced recursion topics in four consecutive class periods, while a
   second group was taught recursion in two two-period blocks that were
   separated by several class periods. It was unknown whether the time
   period separating the presentation of basic and advanced material would
   benefit, or hinder, student comprehension. Statistical analysis of
   empirical data indicates that students learning basic and advanced
   recursion in a consecutive unit of instruction spend less time solving
   their problems than the students learning the topic in two separated
   units, while achieving comparable scores. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

DE mental model; instructional design; instructional design models
AB Mental models are one way that humans represent knowledge (Markman,
   1999). Instructional design ( ID) is a conceptual model for developing
   instruction and typically includes analysis, design, development,
   implementation, and evaluation (i.e., ADDIE model). ID, however, has
   been viewed differently by practicing teachers and instructional
   designers ( Kennedy, 1994). In a graduate ID course students
   constructed their own ID models. This study analyzed student models for
   (a) what ADDIE components were included (by teacher, nonteacher), and
   (b) model structural characteristics (by teacher, nonteacher).
   Participants included 178 students in 12 deliveries of a master's level
   ID course (115 teachers, 63 nonteachers). Our conceptual ID model is
   presented, and the ID model task is described. Students most frequently
   represented design, followed by program evaluation, needs assessment,
   development, and implementation. In terms of structural
   characteristics, 76 models were characterized as metaphoric, 61
   dynamic, and 35 sequential. Three interrelated conclusions and
   implications for ID learning are offered.

AB In this descriptive investigation, we seek to confirm and extend a
   technique for automatically scoring concept maps. Sixty unscored
   concept maps from a published dissertation were scored using a
   computer-based technique adapted from Schvaneveldt ( 1990) and
   colleague's Pathfinder network approach. The scores were based on link
   lines drawn between terms and on the geometric distances between terms.
   These concept map scores were compared to terminology and comprehension
   posttest scores. Concept map scores derived from link data were more
   related to terminology whereas concept map scores derived from distance
   data were more related to comprehension. A step-by-step description of
   the scoring technique is presented and the next steps in the
   development process are discussed.

AB This study investigated the effect of conceptual change text-oriented
   instruction over traditional instruction on students' understanding of
   solution concepts (e.g., dissolving, solubility, factors affecting
   solubility, concentrations of solutions, types of solutions, physical
   properties of solutions) and their attitudes towards chemistry. The
   sample of this study consisted of 87 undergraduate students from two
   classes enrolled in an introductory chemistry course. One of the
   classes was assigned randomly to the control group, and the other class
   were assigned randomly to the experimental group. During teaching the
   topic of solution concepts in the chemistry curriculum, a conceptual
   change text-oriented instruction was applied in the experimental group
   whereas traditional instruction was followed in the control group. The
   results showed that the students in the experimental group performed
   better with respect to solution concepts. In addition, it has been
   found that there was no significant difference between the attitudes of
   students in the experimental and control groups towards chemistry.

DE self-efficacy; science; primary teacher; elementary teacher
AB Self-efficacy has been shown to be an issue of concern for primary
   teacher education students - many of them have low self-efficacy and
   this can negatively affect their future teaching of science. Previous
   research has identified four factors that may contribute towards
   self-efficacy: enactive mastery experiences, vicarious experiences,
   verbal persuasion and physiological/affective states. It could also be
   argued that there are additional sources of self-efficacy that apply to
   primary teacher education students, namely cognitive content mastery,
   cognitive pedagogical mastery and simulated modelling. The main purpose
   of the present paper was to investigate the relative importance of the
   various sources of self-efficacy in a primary science methods course.
   Data on changes in self-efficacy and sources of self-efficacy were
   collected throughout the course using formal and informal surveys. It
   was found that the main source of self-efficacy was cognitive
   pedagogical mastery.

DE cosmology; cross-cultural learning; physics; religion; upper secondary
   students; worldview
AB The article is addressing how students reason about the origin and
   development of the universe. Students' own views as well as their
   descriptions of physical models are analysed. Data consists of written
   surveys, and interviews of a subset of the students. Most of the
   students relate to the Big Bang model when describing the origin of the
   universe. The study however shows that this can mean different things
   to the students. The article also addresses views of whether or not the
   universe changes and of the origin of the elements. When comparing
   students' own views with their views of the physics view this study
   shows that there are students who have a different view of their own
   than the view they connect with physics. This shows that students, in
   the area of cosmology, do not necessarily take the view they connect
   with physics to be their own. Examples of students who handle the
   physics view in different ways are discussed. There are students who
   relate not only to science but also to a religious worldview when
   describing their own view. This shows that when discussing cosmology in
   class, also a religious worldview can be relevant for parts of the
   student group.

ID RAVEN
AB This study investigates whether the generation of exploratory talk in
   grade seven, second-language science classrooms in the Eastern Cape
   Province, South Africa, has a positive effect on learners in terms of
   their problem-solving and reasoning skills and whether socio-cultural
   milieus (urban, peri-urban and rural settings of schools) have an
   effect on any cognitive gains that may be made by learners. The
   findings were that there is a clear and statistically significant
   improvement in the mean test scores on problem-solving and reasoning of
   pupils who participated in the classroom discussion initiative
   (exploratory talk) over those of the comparison groups. This result was
   consistent in both the first- and second-studies that were undertaken.
   There was also a significant difference between the gains in
   problem-solving and reasoning test scores of the three
   socio-geographical settings in which the participating schools are
   found.

AB This paper investigated the change of the Junior Secondary School
   Chemistry Curriculum (JSSCC) in the P. R. China over the period from
   1978 to 2001. Document analysis was employed as the research method and
   data were collected from various versions of teaching syllabi,
   textbooks, and teachers' reference books published during this period.
   The changes of the purposes and content of the JSSCC were traced in the
   view of scientific literacy, which incorporates both subject matter and
   companion meanings in the light of the concept of 'curriculum
   emphases.' It was found that subject matter had been increasingly
   enlarged in its breadth but its requirements gradually decreased while
   companion meanings at different levels of this curriculum had been
   increasingly added from 1978 to 2001. On the basis of these findings it
   was concluded that the JSSCC had experienced a transition from being
   more elite to more future citizenry oriented during the period under
   study. Two implications of this study for science curriculum research
   were discussed.

   secondary school level. In the third year of this investigation the
   students, who by now were in Year 12, underwent a teaching sequence
   that centred on the teaching and learning of physical optics and
   quantum ideas. The students' mental models of the nature of light were
   explored prior to, and following this teaching sequence. The researcher
   took on the dual roles of teacher and researcher. This paper will
   outline the findings of the third year of this study and the
   implications they have for the teaching and learning of optics at

TI Students-exhibits interaction at a science center
SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING
LA English
DT Article
AB In this study we investigate students' learning during their
   interaction with two exhibits at a science center. Specifically, we
   analyze both students' procedures when interacting with exhibits and
   their understanding of the scientific concepts presented therein.
   Bernstein's theory of pedagogic discourse (1990, 2000) provided the
   sociological foundation to assess the exhibit-student interaction and
   allowed analysis of the influence of the characteristics of students,
   exhibits, and interactions on students' learning. Eight students (ages
   12ndash; 13 years of age) with distinct sociological characteristics
   participated in the study. Several findings emerged from the results.
   First, the characteristics of the students, exhibits, and interactions
   appeared to influence student learning. Second, to most students, what
   they did interactively (procedures) seems not to have had any direct
   consequence on what they learned (concept understanding). Third, the
   data analysis suggest an important role for designers and teachers in
   overcoming the limitations of exhibit-student interaction. (c) 2006

LA English
DT Article
AB Distance education is a significant topic of discussion within
   institutions at all levels of education. It is not only significant in
   terms of finances and student enrollment but also in terms of
   meaningful learning. The purpose of this study was to determine the
   relative effectiveness of three distance-education strategies for
   enhancing the science learning of 94 Midwestern elementary-school
   teachers participating in a 5-year professional-development project.
   The three distance-education strategies studied were interactive
   television with all presenters live in real time (live), interactive
   television with live discussions wrapped around videotaped
   presentations (video), and asynchronous, Web-based sessions with
   streamed videotaped presentations supported by interaction through
   discussion boards (Web). A repeated measures design was used to analyze
   the science learning and attitudes of the study participants. Analysis
   of variance of participants' postsession science scores yielded
   differences (p < 0.05) on multiple-choice and constructed-response
   science subscales. Participants in the live mode outperformed
   participants in the Web and video modes on all three assessment types
   (multiple choice, constructed response, and vignettes). Participants in
   the Web mode outperformed participants in the video mode on multiple
   choice and constructed response. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID CHEMISTRY TEXTBOOKS; SCIENCE; TEXT; TEACHERS
AB Science instructors and textbook authors often use analogies to help
   their students use information they already understand to develop an
   understanding of new concepts. This study reports the results of an
   analysis of the use of analogies in eight biochemistry textbooks, which
   included textbooks written for one-semester survey biochemistry courses
   for non-majors; two-semester courses for chemistry or biochemistry
   majors; and biochemistry courses for medical school students. We
   present an analysis of how analogies are used and presented in
   biochemistry textbooks, and we compare the use of analogies in
   biochemistry textbooks to the use of analogies in other science
   textbooks. We also compare the use of analogies in biochemistry
   textbooks with the factors known to promote spontaneous transfer of
   attributes and relations from analog concept to target concept. (c)

TI Accuracy of scale conceptions in science: Mental maneuverings across
   many orders of spatial magnitude
SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING
LA English
DT Article
ID CATEGORIZATION; EXPERTS
AB The use of unifying themes that span the various branches of science is
   recommended to enhance curricular coherence in science instruction.
   Conceptions of spatial scale are one such unifying theme. This research
   explored the accuracy of spatial scale conceptions of science phenomena
   across a spectrum of 215 participants: fifth grade, seventh grade,
   ninth grade, twelfth grade, and doctoral students in science.
   Conceptions spanning sizes from one nanometer to one billion meters
   were investigated through use of written assessments and individual
   interviews. Results showed that accuracy of conceptions at small scale
   were not symmetrical with respect to conceptions at large scale. Large
   scale accuracy tended to decline in a smooth, uniform fashion as the
   scale increased, whereas small scale accuracy displayed a discontinuity
   at the microscopic level. To conceptually interact with scales far
   removed from human scale, experts used strategies of mentally jumping
   to a new scale-world. Experts tended not to transition smoothly between
   the differently scaled worlds but rather to make a discontinuous leap,
   maintaining abstract linkages between the worlds via mathematics.
   Implications of these findings for curriculum development and classroom
   instruction are discussed. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Toward a new conception of conceptions: Interplay of talk, gestures,
   and structures in the setting
SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING
LA English
DT Article
ID DISCOURSE; EMBODIMENT; EMERGENCE; LANGUAGE; SPEECH; THINK
AB Most studies about students' conceptions and conceptual change are
   based exclusively on the analysis language, which is treated as a tool
   to make private contents of the mind public to researchers. Following
   recent studies that focused on (a) language and discursive practice and
   (b) the pragmatics of communication that draws on talk, gestures, and
   semiotic resources in the setting, we propose a redefinition of the
   nature of conception. Conceptions are understood as the dialectical
   relation of simultaneously available speech, gestures, and contextual
   structures that cannot be reduced to verbal rendering because gestures
   and contextual structures constitute different modalities in the
   communication. Drawing on data collected during a physics unit about
   gas taught in French tenth grade classrooms, we show why an appropriate
   account of conceptions requires: (a) gestures simultaneously produced
   with talk; and (b) identification of the relevant structures in the
   setting used by the participants as meaning-making (semiotic)
   resources. We propose to: (a) reconceptualize the notion of conception
   as consisting of a dialectical unit of all relevant semiotic
   (meaning-making) resources publicly made available by a speaker (talk,
   gesture, context); and (b) consider conceptual change through the
   temporal evolution of the dialectical unit defined in this manner. (c)

AB In this study we examined response patterns in exchanges between males
   and females and their effects on gender participation in five online
   debates. Students classified messages into arguments, evidence,
   critiques, and elaborations while posting messages to the debates to
   facilitate argumentation and the sequential analysis of
   message-response sequences. The findings revealed no differences in
   number of critiques posted in response to arguments because females
   were just as likely as males to critique messages from both males and
   females, and because females responded to males with critiques at a
   higher than expected frequency. Posthoc analysis revealed strong
   indications that females posted fewer rebuttals to the critiques of
   females than males, and males posted more rebuttals to the critiques of
   females than females. The methods used in this study illustrate a
   process-oriented approach to explain and predict gender differences in
   participation and serve as a framework for future research on gender
   participation, group interaction, and strategies for facilitating
   collaborative argumentation and problem solving.

AB Collaborating closely with a 10th-grade science teacher, we designed a
   Web-based learning environment (Web-LE) to improve student motivation
   to learn science. Factors believed to enhance intrinsic motivation
   (challenge, control, curiosity, and fantasy) were integrated into the
   instructional design of the Web-based learning tool. The Web-LE was
   implemented in the teacher's 10th-grade classroom as a three-day
   student-centered learning activity. Data collection methods included
   individual student interviews, teacher interviews, motivation
   questionnaires, and observations. This study revealed multiple forms of
   evidence that the Web-LE and the associated learning activity improved
   student motivation. This study illustrates the benefits of educational
   researchers working closely with teachers using design-based research
   methods to successfully solve instructional problems and identify
   reusable design principles. Design principles for the integration of
   intrinsic motivation factors into the development of similar Web-LEs
   are presented as well as directions for future research.

AB Discussions about transfer have mainly dealt with how people manage to
   do something in a situation thanks to having done something similar in
   a previous situation. From an educational point of view, however, it
   appears more fruitful to consider the case when the learner, having
   learned to do something in I situation, might be able to do something
   different in other situations, thanks to perceived differences (and
   similarities) between situations. The case is made for widening the
   focus of attention to how situations are related through differences
   (and similarities).

TI Tracing the evolution of pedagogical content knowledge as the
   development of interanimated discourses
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID MATHEMATICS CLASSROOM; ARGUMENTATION
AB For this article, the development of I teacher's pedagogical content
   knowledge (Shulman, 1986) was tracked longitudinally across 2 years as
   she taught a new instructional unit in middle school mathematics.
   Growth in pedagogical content knowledge is characterized as the
   interanimation of 2 Discourses (Gee, 1999). One Discourse refers to
   characteristic ways that students talk and act about the mathematics of
   the unit; and the other Discourse, to characteristic ways that the
   teacher talks and acts as she guides the development of students'
   mathematical thinking. At the inception of the unit, the variety of
   small d discourses students and teacher generated were only loosely
   coupled. Initially, the teacher responded to variations in student talk
   and activity by employing general revoicing heuristics, such as
   repeating what a student had said so that others could hear or by
   asking a question to elicit further elaboration of a particular
   student's pattern of thought. As the teacher attempted to orchestrate
   classroom conversations oriented toward developing mathematical
   understanding, these general heuristics often failed to transform
   student thinking in ways that she considered mathematically productive.
   As a consequence, she generated new conversational gambits that were
   more often tuned to particular elements of students' mathematical talk
   and activity. Some of these forms of talk created more fruitful
   classroom discourse about mathematics, which the teacher increasingly
   recognized as signals of particular ways of thinking about the
   mathematics (of slope). The teacher was not content with mere
   recognition. She elaborated and continued to innovate. Conjectures
   about the growth of pedagogical content knowledge were tested in
   video-stimulated structured interviews with the teacher and by modeling
   the syntax of teacher support of student thinking-predicting specific
   patterns of couplings between student and teacher Discourses. This
   article concludes with a discussion of the implications of this view
   for the ontogenesis of adaptive expertise.

AB This study focused on students' misconceptions related to evaporation,
   evaporation rate, and vapour pressure. Open-ended diagnostic questions
   were used with 107 undergraduates in the Primary Science Teacher
   Training Department in a state university in Turkey. In addition, 14
   students from that sample were interviewed to clarify their written
   responses and to further probe their understandings of the questions
   asked in the test. The findings revealed a number of misconceptions,
   many of which have not been previously documented. The results have
   implications for tertiary level teaching suggesting that a substantial
   review of teaching strategies is needed.

AB This paper discusses the findings of an evaluative and interpretive
   study into the potential of in-service education to improve science
   education in Swaziland. Short-term and long-term effects of an
   in-service intervention are evaluated in terms of changes in classroom
   processes. The teaching approach of participating teachers has been
   monitored and analysed before, during and 1 year after the in-service
   intervention, to assess whether changes occurred. The study revealed
   the subjective interpretations of teachers about those changes, also in
   relation to contextual factors. Recommendations are put forward to
   enhance the potential of in-service education in comparable contexts.

TI Students' ideas about reaction rate and its relationship with
   concentration or pressure
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID EQUILIBRIUM
AB This cross-sectional study identifies key conceptual difficulties
   experienced by upper secondary school and pre-service chemistry
   teachers (N = 191) in the area of reaction rates. Students' ideas about
   reaction rates were elicited through a series of written tasks and
   individual interviews. In this paper, students' ideas related to
   reaction rate and its relationship with concentration or pressure are
   discussed. Evidence is presented to support the following claims.
   First, school students tended to use "macroscopic" modelling rather
   than using "particulate" and/or "mathematical" modelling. By contrast,
   undergraduates were more likely to provide explanations based upon
   theoretical models and entities within established chemical ideas.
   Nevertheless, second, they had conceptual difficulties in making
   transformation within and across different theoretical models. Finally,
   students did not generally use a scientifically acceptable concept of
   reaction rate across contexts. Although an acceptable concept may have
   been used in one context, incorrect ideas may, nonetheless, have been
   used in other contexts. However, undergraduates' responses were less
   affected by context. Several conceptual difficulties exhibited by
   school students persisted among undergraduates. Some possible
   implications for planning the curriculum and teaching are proposed in
   the light of the results.

TI Mapping children's discussions of evidence in science to assess

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID CLASSROOMS; STUDENTS; DISCOURSE
AB The research reported in this paper concerns the development of
   children's skills of interpreting and evaluating evidence in science.
   Previous studies have shown that school teaching often places limited
   emphasis on the development of these skills, which are necessary for
   children to engage in scientific debate and decision-making. The
   research, undertaken in the United Kingdom, involved four collaborative
   decision-making activities to stimulate group discussion, each carried
   out with five groups of four children (10-11 years old). The research
   shows how the children evaluated evidence for possible choices and
   judged whether their evidence was sufficient to support a particular
   conclusion or the rejection of alternative conclusions. A mapping
   technique was developed to analyse the discussions and identify
   different "levels" of argumentation. The authors conclude that suitable
   collaborative activities that focus on the discussion of evidence can
   be developed to exercise children's ability to argue effectively in
   making decisions.

ID KNOWLEDGE; LITERACY
AB As part of a long-term research study to enhance science learning, this
   paper reports on an exploratory study aimed at identifying initial
   beliefs and practices of a group of teachers and students (Years 4-6)
   in Australia when the students engaged with multiple representations of
   the same science concepts. There is growing recognition in science
   education research that students need to understand and link different
   representational modes, such as graphic and verbal modes, in learning
   to think and act scientifically. This exploratory study used a
   multi-site case-study approach employing qualitative and quantitative
   methods. The findings indicated that while teachers used various modes
   to engage students and assess learning, they were not systematic in
   their focus on student integration and translation across modes. The
   study found that various factors affected students' understanding of
   different modes, and that students who recognised relationships between
   modes demonstrated better conceptual understandings than students who
   lacked this knowledge.

TI Can we evaluate the impact of a critical detail? The role of a type of
   diagram in understanding optical imaging
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes an attempt at evaluating a potentially critical
   "detail" of teaching practice; that is, using a particular diagram to
   illustrate the imaging role of a converging lens. This "basic" diagram
   has been designed to contribute to help students overcome the
   well-known "travelling image" syndrome. We conducted a comparative
   study with 125 students in all, at three academic levels: end of
   secondary school, degree students, and teacher training. The groups
   compared had previously been taught elementary optical imaging in a
   classical, uncontrolled manner, and were presented with two classical
   questions, commonly used to demonstrate students' difficulties. In each
   group, one-half of the students had a classic introductory diagram and
   the other half had the "basic" one. A positive reaction of students to
   the evaluated diagram was observed at a relatively high academic level
   (trainee physics teachers and degree students), in contrast with an
   apparent lack of effect at the end of secondary school. The paper ends
   with a discussion of the evaluation of a detail of practice in
   isolation, with respect to the distance between students' actual and
   targeted levels of comprehension.

TI Variation in student reflections on their conceptions of and approaches
   to learning biochemistry in a first-year health sciences' service
   subject
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID EXPERIENCES; UNIVERSITY; OUTCOMES; QUALITY
AB Many factors affect students' learning approaches, including topic
   conceptions and prior study. This research, undertaken after a
   first-semester compulsory subject, explores students' conceptions of
   biochemistry and how they approached their studies. Students (n = 151)
   completed an open-ended survey analysed phenomenographically. Those
   with cohesive conceptions were found to be more likely to adopt deeper
   approaches to study than those with fragmented conceptions, a result
   unaffected by various demographic parameters. Compared with earlier
   research, a semester of study increased the percentage of students with
   a cohesive view, with no concomitant change in learning approaches,
   suggesting that cohesive conceptions are a necessary but not sufficient
   criterion for deep learning outcomes. Compared with results for a
   science major subject, more of the students with cohesive conceptions
   used surface approaches. This may reflect a regression to safe surface
   approaches when faced with an unfamiliar topic or high total workload
   driving a strategic approach to learning. It could also reflect a
   perception that this material is only a tool for later application. The
   present findings indicate the crucial importance, when university
   studies begin, of enabling students to build an overarching conception
   of the topic's place in professional practice. This concept building
   should be applied across the entire curriculum to emphasize application
   and integration of material (key graduate attributes). Improved
   conceptions may provide crucial motivation for students to achieve
   deeper learning, especially in these foundation service subjects. These
   essential changes to the learning context may also better prepare
   students for increasing self-directed/life-long learning.

AB In resource-based learning scenarios, students are often overwhelmed by
   the complexity of task-relevant knowledge and information. Techniques
   for the external interactive representation of individual knowledge in
   graphical format may help them to cope with complex problem situations.
   Advanced computer-based concept-mapping tools have the potential to
   foster spatial learning strategies and processes of individual
   knowledge management. In addition, they have the potential to represent
   not only conceptual knowledge, but also content knowledge about a
   domain, as well as knowledge resources. The paper analyzes the
   potential of digital concept maps for supporting processes of
   individual knowledge management in resource-based learning. After a
   brief review of the structural, representational, processing, and
   usability features of digital concept maps, results of empirical
   research related to the following main management processes are
   considered: knowledge identification/evaluation, information search,
   knowledge generation, knowledge representation/organization, knowledge
   communication, and knowledge use.

TI The ZAP project: designing interactive computer tools for learning
   psychology
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL

AB In the ZAP project, a set of interactive computer programs called
   'ZAPs' was developed. The programs were designed in such a way that
   first-year students experience psychological phenomena in a vivid and
   self-explanatory way. Students can either take the role of participant
   in a psychological experiment, they can experience phenomena
   themselves, or they can take the role of researcher and learn by
   discovery. ZAPs provide added value to existing learning materials
   about psychological topics and can elicit experiential and discovery
   learning activities. This article discusses the practical and
   theoretical considerations that underlie the design and structure of
   ZAPs and provides guidelines for their practical application in
   different educational settings.

DT Article
AB Micronutrient malnutrition (MM) is a global health problem that affects
   the national socioeconomic stability of an affected country. This
   article describes a multimedia training tool, the Micronutrient Action
   Plan instructional tool (MAPit), which has been designed to support
   public health professionals' efforts to eliminate MM. An overview and
   description of the main sections and features of MAPit are provided.
   The system is unique from other training tools on this topic because it
   reviews all components of an elimination program in one publication, it
   is based on a new model that highlights the dynamic nature of MM
   programs, and it includes an extensive archive of resources related to
   MM. MAPit is an initial step that builds the capacity of public health
   professionals to collaborate with national partners in MM-prevention
   and elimination activities.

TI Enhancing the teaching experience of pre-service teachers through the

SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
ID REFLECTION
AB The provision of feedback to students is an important aspect of
   teaching and learning processes. It is often a necessary requirement
   for the stimulation of self-reflection. This paper describes the use of
   video-enabled, webbased computer-mediated communication (CMC) for the
   provision of feedback to pre-service, trainee teachers who were
   involved in a Teaching Practicum course within a teacher-education
   programme. Pre-service teachers' micro-teaching and field-teaching
   performances were videotaped and made available for viewing within the
   CMC system. Experienced high-school teachers were asked to critique the
   pre-service teachers' performances and to lead the discussions using
   the CMC system. The results of questionnaires that were administered to
   all participants of the study indicated that the system effectively
   enhanced pre-service teachers' teaching experience. Five reasons cited
   for the success were: easy access to taped teaching sessions; better
   assessment of personal teaching style; more sharing of one's teaching
   and more learning from peer teaching; more concrete feedback; and more
   effective involvement of experienced teachers.

   University and the University of Plymouth). The evaluation revealed
   that how the system was introduced, rather than demographic or course
   factors, affected students' usage and perceptions of it.

AB Amongst the many recent developments in learning technology, video
   streaming appears to offer a considerable range of benefits for tutors
   and learners alike. For these to be fully realised, however, various
   conditions have to be met. Merely making streams available and
   directing students to them, does not necessarily result in quality, or
   indeed any, learning. Drawing on material from the literature and the
   World Wide Web, as well as recent project experience, this paper
   discusses the potential effectiveness of video streams as learning
   resources in higher education within the context of current and
   possible future technologies.

   of the award scheme and touch on the limited literature which is
   available in this area. Following a description of our methodology, we
   then present our data. Firstly we focus on who the winners are and then
   on gender differences, whether the award is a reward or a millstone,
   and finally the impact on the individual, the degree of institutional
   support for winners would appear to be a major determinant of whether
   the award was experiences as a reward or a penalty.
