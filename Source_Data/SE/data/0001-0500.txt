TI Scientific Processes in PISA Tests Observed for Science Teachers
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID EDUCATION; SCHOOL
AB A research study, mainly based on the notion of 'scientific literacy'
   from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2003
   assessment framework, was carried out obtaining data from the
   administration of an open written questionnaire with items covering
   three central scientific processes-describing, explaining and
   predicting scientific phenomena; understanding scientific
   investigation; and interpreting scientific evidence and conclusions-to
   30 experienced in-service secondary school science teachers. The
   purpose was to analyse their views regarding the competences on the
   mentioned scientific processes assessed by Science PISA tests: which of
   the competences assessed were the most frequently identified by
   teachers, which of the competences they considered presenting
   difficulties for their students, and, finally, which activities they
   used in their classes to promote similar competences. Our results
   indicated that teachers had different perceptions of one or other
   scientific processes considered relevant for scientific literacy in the
   PISA framework. Their awareness of the expected students' difficulties
   did not necessarily match the competences intended to be assessed by
   either PISA or what they thought to be assessed. Moreover, their views
   differed depending not only on the type of scientific process but also
   on the underlying subject. Concern about the students' need of reading
   fluently with understanding and of paying special attention during the
   test time was also observed.

AB This study assessed the influence of training in, and use of,
   metacognitive strategies on the development of prospective elementary
   teachers' views of nature of science (NOS). Participants were 49
   students (92% female) enrolled in two sections of an elementary science
   methods course. The sections were randomly assigned to an intervention
   group and a comparison group. Students in both groups were engaged with
   explicit-reflective NOS instruction, which focused on the empirical,
   tentative, theory-driven, inferential, and creative NOS. Additionally,
   students in the intervention group received instruction in, and used,
   three metacognitive strategies during their engagement with thinking
   about NOS. The Views of Nature of Science Questionnaire-Form C and the
   Metacognitive Awareness Inventory were respectively used to assess
   participants' views of NOS and metacognitive awareness at the beginning
   and conclusion of the study. Data analyses indicated that significantly
   more students in the intervention group explicated more informed views
   of the target aspects of NOS. Moreover, these substantial changes were
   coupled with significantly increased Metacognitive Awareness Inventory
   scores for the intervention group participants. The results point to a
   relationship between improved metacognitive awareness and the
   development of informed understandings of NOS.

AB Students' attitudes toward chemistry lessons in school are important
   dependent variables in curriculum evaluation. Although a variety of
   instruments have been developed by researchers to evaluate student
   attitudes, they are plagued with problems such as the lack of
   theoretical rationale and of empirical evidence to support the
   construct validity of data. This paper describes a study of students'
   attitudes toward chemistry lessons in Hong Kong secondary schools. One
   of the scales in the Test of Science-Related Attitudes developed by
   Fraser was modified to form an Attitude Toward Chemistry Lessons Scale
   (ATCLS). The construction of the ATCLS was based on a theoretical model
   with four dimensions: liking for chemistry theory lessons, liking for
   chemistry laboratory work, evaluative beliefs about school chemistry,
   and behavioural tendencies to learn chemistry. The arguments for
   inclusion of these four dimensions are presented. The final version of
   ATCLS was administered to 954 students. The results of confirmatory
   factor analysis indicated that there was a good fit between the
   hypothesised model and the observed data.

   Evaluation of a teaching sequence
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MODELS
AB The present article presents a didactic proposal oriented to teaching
   notions of semiconductor physics in secondary education. The methods
   and the results of a pilot study designed to analyse the effectiveness
   of a teaching sequence on the topic are also described. The subjects
   were 60 students, aged 14-15 years, of a secondary school in Seville,
   Spain. The levels of knowledge acquired by the students were evaluated
   by means of a test and personal interviews, which we also used to
   detect the most frequent obstacles they encountered against learning.
   Also, we employed personal interviews and analysis of the students'
   notebooks to evaluate their attitudes towards semiconductor physics and
   its learning, and to evaluate the degree to which the teaching sequence
   fosters cooperative learning and the self-regulation of learning. The
   results indicated that the students in general acquired ideas and
   reasoning in the appropriate line, although with some mistakes or
   inaccuracies with respect to scientific conceptions, and acquired
   positive attitudes towards the learning of semiconductor physics, with
   a high degree of motivation during the teaching-learning process. The
   conclusion is that it is possible to initiate teaching the basic
   notions of semiconductor physics in secondary education, although it is
   necessary to continue going deeper into the topic with new research. As
   a proposal for improvement in future actions, we formulate new
   objectives oriented at overcoming the students' commonest obstacles
   against learning with respect to the topic.

AB Over 20 years of research into the use of cross-curricular drama in
   secondary science has indicated that this medium enables learning of
   affective, cognitive and procedural knowledge. To date, academic
   research has tended to frame successful drama pedagogy as resulting
   from a Drama-in-Education approach, incorporating extended role plays
   and simulations of social events. By contrast, research has rarely
   focused on the scope and context of drama which is devised and used by
   real people in real situations. Indications from non-academic
   literature and informal education practice suggest that there is a gap
   in our knowledge between research and classroom practice. This study
   focused on teachers' own drama activities in five science lessons
   taught across schools in Cambridge, Kent, and Hertfordshire. Their
   classes spanned the ages of 12-16 in the subjects of chemistry,
   biology, and physics. This study explored the drama forms, teaching
   objectives, and characteristics by which drama was perceived to enable
   learning in Science. The findings revealed that drama activities were
   used to convey a variety of topics that have not yet been recorded in
   academic literature, and revealed a greater scope for the teaching
   abstract scientific concepts through mime and role play. These
   activities were perceived to develop students' visualisation through a
   range of modalities, which included embodied sensation and
   anthropomorphic metaphors. Some features reflected the development of
   thought experiment skills. A pedagogic model was produced based on
   different levels of interactive talk and multimodal communication.

AB Design-based research, and particularly its theoretical status, is a
   subject of debate in the science education community. In the first part
   of this paper, a theoretical framework drawn up to develop design-based
   research will be presented. This framework is mainly based on
   epistemological analysis of physics modelling, learning and teaching
   hypotheses. It includes grand theories, a specific theory that
   following Cobb, Confrey, diSessa, Lehrer, and Schauble is a "humble
   theory" in the sense that it does "real work", and tools for design. In
   the second part, we will show how this specific theory and its tools
   led designers to develop teaching resources in the case of a teaching
   sequence on mechanics (Grade 10). We will explain how the components of
   the specific theory and tools guide the design at different levels; the
   conceptual structure of the teaching sequence, the chronology of the
   activities, the various choices of the type of activity and their
   wording. This presentation makes the bases of designing teaching
   resources explicit and therefore allows for scientific debate.

TI Exploring Secondary Science Teachers' Perceptions on the Goals of Earth
   Science Education in Taiwan
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENTIFIC LITERACY; MOTIVATION; CURRICULUM; STUDENTS
AB The educational reform movement since the 1990s has led the secondary
   earth science curriculum in Taiwan into a stage of reshaping. The
   present study investigated secondary earth science teachers'
   perceptions on the Goals of Earth Science Education (GESE). The GESE
   should express the statements of philosophy and purpose toward which
   educators direct their attention, and provide the visions or broad aims
   that earth science education is designed to achieve. Based on this
   rationale, the purpose of this study was to explore teachers'
   perceptions on the GESE at secondary school level (Grades 7-12) in
   Taiwan. A national survey of 1,000 earth science teachers was conducted
   in May 2004, with a response rate of 70.2%. The results revealed that
   'Students acquire basic earth science concepts' is the most important
   GESE both in teachers' preferred goal and their actual teaching
   practice in the secondary earth science education; that there is a
   major gap between teachers' preferred and actual GESE in terms of
   'Preparing students for the entrance examinations'; and that the
   differences between teachers' preferred and actual GESE are contingent
   on the teachers' age, the school size, and the teacher education
   background of teachers.

TI Does Practical Work Really Motivate? A study of the affective value of
   practical work in secondary school science
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID ATTITUDES; RECALL
AB The present paper reports on a study that examined whether practical
   work can be said to have affective outcomes, and if so in what sense.
   The term 'affective' is used here to refer to the emotions, or
   feelings, engendered amongst pupils towards school science in general,
   or one of the sciences in particular. The study is based on 25
   multi-site case studies that employed a condensed fieldwork strategy.
   Data were collected, using tape-recorded interviews and observational
   field notes, in a sample of practical lessons undertaken in English
   comprehensive (non-selective) schools during Key Stages 3 and 4 (ages
   11-14 years and 15-16 years, respectively). The findings suggest that
   whilst practical work generates short-term engagement, it is relatively
   ineffective in generating motivation to study science post compulsion
   or longer-term personal interest in the subject, although it is often
   claimed to do so. This suggests that those involved with science
   education need to develop a more realistic understanding of the
   limitations of practical work in the affective domain.

TI Beginning Secondary Science Teachers in Different Induction Programmes:
   The first year of teaching
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; BELIEFS; INQUIRY; IMPACT; KNOWLEDGE; REFORM
AB While it is generally acknowledged that the first years of teaching are
   the most difficult, little is known about the development of subject
   matter specialists during this period. In order to add to the knowledge
   in this area, the present study explores the first year of 114
   secondary science teachers as they participate in one of four different
   induction programmes. The data collected in this study consist of
   observations of practice, and of interviews about beliefs, pedagogical
   content knowledge and experiences throughout the year. Quantitative and
   qualitative analysis of the data revealed that, as a group, the
   beginning teachers held teacher-centred practices, beliefs, and
   pedagogical content knowledge. Analysis by induction programme,
   however, revealed that teachers who participated in science-specific
   induction programmes significantly changed their beliefs and used more
   investigations in their classroom lessons than did their peers in the
   other induction programmes. Moreover, the physical proximity of
   colleagues was also important to the well-being of beginning teachers.
   This study supports the development of science-specific induction
   programmes, and provides evidence that the composition of the programme
   and the assigned location of the new teacher are important factors
   during a teacher's first year.

ID SCHOOL SUCCESS; SOCIAL-CLASS; ACHIEVEMENT; EDUCATION; MODEL; GENDER;
   GRADES
AB The literature on students' attitudinal constructs in science education
   asserts that students hold dichotomous attitudes toward science (AS).
   For instance, studies from the Relevance of Science Education project
   reveal that students possess negative attitudes in terms of their
   favourableness toward school science, preference toward scientific
   careers, and emotional states toward science (negative intrinsic AS),
   despite their positive perception that science is important for society
   (positive extrinsic AS). The issue demands in-depth examination, since
   not enough science educators have studied the effects of the
   dichotomous AS on science education. Rather, they have attempted to
   improve the uncategorised AS for stimulating student achievement in
   science education. Hence, the aim of this study is to clarify how the
   dichotomous attitude (intrinsic AS and extrinsic AS) relates to the two
   educational products in science: interest inventory and conceptual
   understanding. One hundred and sixteen physics learners in Japan were
   sampled for fitting the structural equation model in this study. Our
   final model validated by LISREL suggests that intrinsic AS exclusively
   stimulate students' interest and conceptual understanding in physics,
   while extrinsic AS fail to play their expected role. Finally, features
   of the sampled 10th-graders and their dichotomous AS are further
   interpreted with the prevalent concept of the hidden curriculum.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID EDUCATION; INQUIRY; FORMS
AB The present study of gifted students' views of assessment is aimed at
   understanding how the employment of Embedded Assessment for Learning
   (EAfL) framework in science courses for the gifted affects the
   students' views throughout the learning process. The participants were
   86 students in three programmes for the gifted who elected
   project-based science courses. The data included questionnaires,
   distributed at the beginning and at the end of the assessment processes
   in each science course, and in-depth interviews with 12 students, which
   were analysed according to three main themes: general view of
   assessment; assessment modes; and relationships between assessment and
   learning. The students viewed the EAfL framework as an integral part of
   the learning process, and perceived it as a means of expressing
   autonomous learning and a range of performances; characteristics that
   correspond with the students' unique needs. In addition, students
   addressed cognitive and social processes they had undergone. This
   implies that assessment which is explicitly designed to promote
   learning in science courses is a powerful tool for teachers as well as
   for students, and contributes to meaningful learning.

AB An understanding of mechanical waves is a pre-requisite for the study
   of many topics in advanced physics, and indeed in many other
   disciplines. There have been many research studies in mechanical waves,
   all of which have revealed that students have trouble with the basic
   concepts. Therefore, in order for teachers to prepare appropriate
   instruction for their classes, it is useful to diagnose their students'
   conceptions-if possible before they enter class. It is for this purpose
   that many diagnostic instruments have been developed, often in the form
   of multiple-choice tests. In this study, we have used the open-ended
   Wave Diagnostic Test to develop a multiple-choice conceptual survey in
   an evolutionary manner. The two-year development procedure included
   open-ended surveys and interviews involving 299 Thai students and 88
   Australian students. The final version, called the Mechanical Waves
   Conceptual Survey, has been administered to 632 Australian students
   from high school to second-year university and 270 Thai high school
   students. Standard statistical analyses show that the survey is
   reliable and valid. Further validity checks, including consultation
   with experts, were also carried out. The survey has four
   subtopics-propagation, superposition, reflection, and standing
   waves-and the teachers can choose the subtopics relevant for their
   students. In this paper we also demonstrate the use of a typical survey
   question to test students' conceptual understanding and identify common
   alternative conceptions.

ID CLASSROOM PRACTICE; SCHOOL SCIENCE; EDUCATION; INQUIRY
AB Student-directed, open-ended scientific investigations and invention
   projects may serve to deepen and broaden students' scientific and
   technological literacy, and, in so doing, enable them to succeed in
   democracies greatly affected by processes and products of science and
   technology. Science fairs, events at which student-led projects are
   evaluated and celebrated, could contribute to such positive personal
   and social outcomes. Qualitative data drawn from a national science
   fair over succeeding years indicate (after analyses of largely
   qualitative data, using constant comparative methods) that, apart from
   positive outcomes regarding science literacy, there may be some
   significant issues about the fair that warrant critical review. It is
   apparent from these studies that there are issues of access, image, and
   recruitment associated with the fair. Qualification for participation
   in the fair appears to favour students from advantaged, resource-rich
   backgrounds. Although these students do benefit in a number of ways
   from the fair experience, it is apparent that science fairs also
   greatly benefit sponsors-who can, in a sense, use science fairs for
   promotional and recruitment purposes. These findings and claims raised,
   for us, some important questions possibly having implications for
   science education, and for society more generally.

TI Pupils' Image of 'the Scientist' among Two Communities in Israel: A
   comparative study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; CULTURE
AB The image of 'the scientist' and its effect on the willingness to be a
   scientist and to follow a career in science were investigated in two
   different cultural populations of elementary and junior high school
   pupils in Israel: Hebrew-speaking (secular) pupils (N = 390) and
   Arabic-speaking Bedouin pupils (N = 185). Five different tools were
   employed in our investigation (naming scientists, pictorial
   representation of the scientist ('Draw-a-Scientist-Test'), statements
   regarding the characteristics of the scientist, reasons for wanting/not
   wanting or being able/being unable to be scientists, and sources of
   knowledge regarding the scientist's image). The image held by Hebrew
   pupils was similar to those held by western pupils found in previous
   research, but some details were more elaborate (due to the fact that
   many different tools were employed here). However, the image held by
   the Arabic pupils differed from that found in previous research. This
   image had a strong ethnical trend, with Golden Age Muslim scientists'
   names dominating name lists, and drawings of traditional Muslim
   figures. Another image found in their drawings was of a scientist
   admired as a teacher, emphasising the Bedouin school's formal culture.
   The theory of modernity will be a useful analytical tool to judge the
   results of the investigation, whether the population is supposed to be
   (or is close to) a modern population and whether it does not,
   definitely, fall under this definition (see Methods and Discussion).

TI What Does the Skill of Observation Look Like in Young Children?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Early years; Observation; Primary school; Process skills
ID SCIENCE
AB Fifty-six children, aged between 4 and 11 years, in seven groups, were
   videoed playing with, being questioned about and sorting a collection
   of toys in order to identify what skills of observation looked like in
   young children, how observations influenced other scientific skills and
   what supported the skill of observation. Children's skills of
   observation were found to be similar across all ages and included
   affective, functional, social and exploratory comments, actions, and
   questions. These initial observations led to the use of other
   scientific process skills: classification, prediction, hypotheses,
   along with explanation for younger children and interpretations for
   older children. There was generally a greater sophistication of
   observation skills with increasing age of the children. Observations in
   young children were found to be tactile and developed in two ways: by
   engaging in more unique close observation and interpreting observation
   by utilising previous knowledge and experiences. Important factors
   affecting the development of observational and other scientific skills
   were found to be the context ( activity, environment, resources) and
   combination of social interactions between individuals, peers, and
   adults. This combination supported the development of both
   observational and other scientific skills, although the nature and
   amount of this interaction appeared individual to different groups of
   children and could not be predicted.

AB The existence, preponderance, and stability of misconceptions related
   to evolution continue as foci of research in science education. In
   their 2006 study, Geraedts and Boersma question the existence of stable
   Lamarckian misconceptions in students, challenging the utility of
   Conceptual Change theory in addressing any such misconceptions. To
   support their challenge, they describe the study of a particular
   pedagogical strategy (which they describe as being influened by dynamic
   systems theory) and report the results supporting its effectiveness in
   enhancing students' understanding of evolutionary theory. However, we
   argue that the description offered by Geraedts and Boersma demonstrates
   several flaws, both in its theoretical assertions and methodological
   decisions. In response, we reject the disavowal of Conceptual Change
   theory argued for by these authors due to several theoretical
   misinterpretations. As well, we question the validity of the data
   presented and assertions generated based on the methodologcal
   limitations of the study design.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

DT Article
ID CHILDRENS COSMOLOGIES; CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; MENTAL MODELS; PHYSICS;
   KNOWLEDGE; MATHEMATICS; STUDENTS
AB Understanding frames of reference is critical in describing planetary
   motion and learning astronomy. Historically, the geocentric and
   heliocentric models were defended and advocated against each other.
   Today, there are still many people who do not understand the
   relationship between the two models. This topic is not adequately
   treated in astronomy instruction and is unstudied in science education
   research. The present small-scale study suggests that many science
   teachers of K-8 hold alternative conceptions about the models of the
   solar system. Most of the 14 teachers in the study believed that the
   geocentric model should not be used in classroom instruction because
   they thought that it was wrong. It was found that they justified their
   knowledge claims by following common sense, authority, pragmatism, or
   relativism. Their long-held beliefs, lack of observational experience,
   and resistance in switching between two models made it difficult for
   them to have a deep understanding of the relationship of the two
   models. Specific teaching strategies addressing these learning
   difficulties on this topic are proposed.

AB The astronomy concepts of 345 young people were studied over a 10-year
   period using a multimedia, multi-modal methodology in a research design
   where survey participants were interviewed three times and control
   subjects were interviewed twice. The purpose of the research was to
   search for evidence to clarify competing theories on conceptual
   coherence versus knowledge-in-pieces, distinguishing between coherence
   as revealed in the representational systems at any particular stage in
   a young person's development and the changes evident in mental growth
   thereafter. Thus five research questions concerned with the elements
   and structure of understanding were investigated: (1) conceptual
   coherence shown as patterns of high correlation of concept
   representations between the media used to assess subjects'
   understanding within a survey, as well as (2) coherence revealed as
   consistency of representation of those concepts across media and
   modalities; (3) enhanced conceptual understanding and skill through
   repeated interviews across (longitudinal) surveys, as young people
   develop their knowledge; (4) cultural similarity in subjects'
   representations of basic static concepts (e. g. the shape of the
   Earth); and (5) improved understanding of basic dynamic concepts (e. g.
   the motion of the Earth) and complex dynamic concepts (e. g. seasons
   and eclipses), through "knowledge-skill compounding". The research
   findings supported conceptual coherence and rejected the counter
   argument of knowledge-in-pieces (at an alpha level of .05). Further
   research is recommended to replicate current research in cultures other
   than those of China and New Zealand studied here to confirm the view
   that cognition and knowledge are inherently coherent in young people.

AB This paper reports the findings of two systematic reviews of the use
   and effects of small group discussions in high school science teaching.
   Ninety-four studies were included in an overview (systematic map) of
   work in the area, and 24 studies formed the basis of the in-depth
   reviews. The reviews indicate that there is considerable diversity in
   the topics used to promote small group discussions. They also
   demonstrate that students often struggle to formulate and express
   coherent arguments, and demonstrate a low level of engagement with
   tasks. The reviews suggest that groups function more purposefully, and
   understanding improves most, when specifically constituted such that
   differing views are represented, when some form of training is provided
   for students on effective group work, and when help in structuring
   discussions is provided in the form of "cues". Single-sex groups
   function more purposefully than mixed-sex groups, though improvements
   in understanding are independent of gender composition of groups.
   Finally, the reviews demonstrate very clearly that, for small group
   discussions to be effective, teachers and students need to be given
   explicit teaching in the skills associated with the development of
   arguments and the characteristics associated with effective group
   discussions. In addition to the substantive findings, the paper also
   reports on key features of the methods employed to gather and analyse
   data. Of particular note are the two contrasting approaches to data
   analysis, one adopting a grounded theory approach and the other drawing
   on established methods of discourse analysis.

AB This study explored the influence of a Saturday Science program that
   used explicit reflective instruction through contextualized and
   decontextualized guided and authentic inquiry on K-2 students' views of
   nature of science (NOS). The six-week program ran for 2.5 hours weekly
   and emphasized NOS in a variety of science content areas, culminating
   in an authentic inquiry designed and carried out by the K-2 students.
   The Views of Nature of Science Form D was used to interview K-2
   students pre- and post-instruction. Copies of student work were
   retained for content analysis. Videotapes made of each week's science
   instruction were reviewed to ensure that explicit reflective NOS
   instruction took place. Explicit NOS teaching strategies included (1)
   introducing NOS through decontextualized activities, (2) embedding NOS
   into science content through contextualized activities, (3) using
   children's literature, (4) debriefings and embedded NOS assessments,
   and (5) guided and student-designed inquiries. Results indicate that
   K-2 students improved their NOS views over the course of the program,
   suggesting that they are developmentally ready for these concepts.
   Students developed adequate views of the distinction between
   observation and inference, the creative NOS, the tentative NOS, the
   empirical NOS, and to a lesser degree, the subjective NOS.

AB In response to global climate change, loss of biodiversity, and the
   immense human impact on the carrying capacity of the earth systems,
   attention has been given to sustainable development worldwide. In this
   paper, we explore the emerging field of sustainability science within
   the context of the socio-cultural milieu of Malawi, a sub-Saharan
   African country. Through interviews in vernacular languages and
   observations in the field, our research explores how traditional
   agriculture practices of African elders may contribute to the
   sustainability of the environment and culture in Africa. Findings
   indicate that traditional farmers and food preservationists choose to
   practice indigenous ways of living with nature to live sustainably in a
   globalized economy. Further discussion elucidates how merging
   worldviews and hybridized knowledge and languages can be leveraged to

AB A model of expertise in chemistry problem solving was tested on
   undergraduate science majors enrolled in a chemistry course. The model
   was based on Anderson's Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R)
   theory. The model shows how conceptualization, self-efficacy, and
   strategy interact and contribute to the successful solution of
   quantitative, well-defined chemistry problems in the areas of
   stoichiometry, thermochemistry, and properties of solutions. A
   statistical path analysis and students' explanations Supported the
   model and indicated that the students' problem conceptualization and
   chemistry self-efficacy influenced their strategy use, which, in turn,
   strongly influenced their problem-solving success. The implication of
   these findings for future research and developing students' expertise
   in chemistry problem solving is that it strategy is advantageous when
   it is built on a foundation of conceptual knowledge and chemistry
   self-efficacy. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 46:

AB This study explored the development of a community of learners through
   a professional development program to improve teachers' views of nature
   of science (NOS) and teaching practice. The Views of Nature of Science
   questionnaire and interviews were used to assess teachers' conceptions
   of NOS three times over the course of the study. Notes and videotapes
   taken during workshops and classroom observations were used to track
   influence of the community of learners on classroom practice. The
   community of practice (CoP) was fostered through an intensive summer
   workshop, monthly school site workshops, and classroom support to aid
   teachers in incorporating new techniques and reflecting upon their
   learning and practice. We found that teachers became aware of their
   changes in views about NOS once they struggled with the concepts in
   their own teaching and discussed their struggles within the
   professional development community. The CoP on its own was not
   sufficient to change teacher's practice or knowledge, but it created a
   well-supported environment that facilitated teacher change when paired
   with NOS modeling and explicit reflection. Cases of three teachers are
   used to illustrate changes in views and teaching practice common to the
   teachers in this study. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci

AB One of the main objectives of many science educators is to enroll
   students into science majors and careers. Researchers have investigated
   students' views of science in terms of factors and influences that
   guide students to choose science as a career. However, few
   investigations exist that have studied the forms of language Culture
   makes available for articulating possible careers generally or the ways
   of grounding (justifying) these possibilities particularly. The purpose
   of this study is to investigate ways of using language for supporting
   justifications of career choices in an interview Situation. Thirteen
   high school biology students were interviewed about their career
   choices. Drawing on discursive psychology as theory and method. we
   identify four interpretative repertoires that are deployed during the
   interviews: the (a) formative, (b) performative, (c) consequent, and
   (d) potential repertoires. These interpretative repertoires do not
   merely characterize the discourse about different science-related
   professions but in fact co-articulate different science-related
   identities. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals. Inc. J Res Sci Teach 46:

AB Dynamic inquiry learning emphasizes aspects of change, intellectual
   flexibility, and critical thinking. Dynamic inquiry learning is
   characterized by the following criteria: learning as a process. changes
   during the inquiry, procedural understanding, and affective points of
   view. This study compared the influence of open versus guided inquiry
   learning approaches on dynamic inquiry Performances among high-school
   biology students. We hypothesized that open inquiry students who engage
   in the inquiry process from its initial stage, participating in the
   decision making process of asking inquiry questions and planning all
   aspects of the inquiry, will outperform students who experienced guided
   inquiry, in terms of developing dynamic inquiry performances. Students
   were divided into two groups: guided and open inquiry learning
   approaches. Both groups were followed throughout their 2-year inquiry
   learning process. The data sources included interviews, students'
   inquiry summary papers, logbooks, and reflections. A quantitative
   content analysis of the two groups, using a dynamic inquiry
   Performances index, revealed that open inquiry students used
   significantly higher levels of performances in the criteria "changes
   during inquiry" and "procedural understanding." However. the study's
   results indicated no significant differences in the criteria "learning
   as a process" and "affective points of view." The implementation of
   dynamic inquiry performances during inquiry learning may shed light on
   the procedural and epistemological scientific understanding of students
   conducting inquiries. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach

AB The main objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of
   a proposed computer-based instructional method in Primary Education for
   self-regulated problem solving. The proposed instructional method is
   based on Sternberg's model of problem solving within an authentic
   context. It consists of three main phases: observation, collaboration
   and semi-structured guidance. The ultimate learning objective is to
   augment the autonomous problem-solving skills of primary school
   children. In our study the Synergo tool was used, which is a
   synchronous computer supported collaborative learning tool, as well as
   the Moodle learning management system. The context which frames the
   method is authentic, very close to a students' realistic learning
   situation. The findings of this study advocate that students can
   increase their problem-solving skills in a relatively short period of
   time. At the same time, they can improve their approach to the solution
   of a given mathematical problem, performing significant signs of
   autonomy. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper describes the findings of an exploratory cycle of a
   design-based research project and examines the learning effectiveness
   of collaborative activities that are supported by the GroupScribbles
   (GS) software technology in two Singapore primary science classrooms.
   The students had ten weeks of GS-based lessons in science, which were
   co-designed by teachers and researchers to teach the curriculum by
   tapping on collaborative work in small groups as well as in the whole
   class. The results show that the GS classes performed better than
   non-GS classes as measured by traditional assessments. With GS,
   students were found to have more opportunities to participate in class
   discussions, and were exposed to diversified ideas. Analysis of data
   collected in the classroom as well as data on students' attitudes and
   perceptions indicate that GS facilitated students' collaborative
   learning, and improved students' epistemology and attitudes toward
   science learning. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper explores online instructors' perceptions on teaching
   experiences occurring in their own countries. The interviewees are
   instructors who have taught online courses for more than two years.
   Eleven interview transcripts, obtained from online instructors from six
   countries (Australia, Canada, China United Kingdom, United States and
   Taiwan) were analyzed by using open and axial coding. The analysis data
   established categories of perceptions related to: teachers' roles in
   the online environment, the methods for interacting with students, and
   teachers' expectations for their future educational careers. Finally,
   three perspectives arose which adequately describe online instructors'
   teaching experiences: interactive activities, evaluation criteria, and
   self-expectations. The study also reveals a link connecting those
   perspectives. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Perceived affective quality is an attractive area of research in
   Information System. Specifically, understanding the intrinsic and
   extrinsic individual factors and interaction effects that influence
   Information and Communications Technology (ICT) acceptance and adoption
   - in higher education - continues to be a focal interest in learning
   research. In this regard, one type of affective reactions toward ICT
   (in our study, the WebCT), perceived affective quality, is an essential
   dimension in user technology acceptance.
   A structural equation modelling, specifically partial least square
   (PLS), is proposed to assess the relationships between the constructs
   together with the predictive power of the research model. The results
   demonstrate that the research model significantly predicts the
   intention to use the WebCT. The results provide strong support for the
   proposals that (a) perceived usefulness, ease of use and flow lead the
   learners towards developing high intention to use the WebCT; and (b)
   perceived affective quality exhibits a relevant interaction effect on
   the model.
   This study, therefore, represents a "crucial test" of non-utilitarian
   influences on use of Web-based applications. The model and results can
   thus be used to assess motivational design aspects during electronic
   learning process. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study developed a Mobile Plant Learning System (MPLS) that
   provides instructors with the ways and means to facilitate student
   learning in an elementary-school-level botany course. The MPLS
   represented in this study was implemented to address problems that
   arise with the use of a didactic approach to teaching and learning
   botany, as is typically used in elementary schools in Taiwan. To extend
   opportunities for learning beyond the classroom, this study used
   personal digital assistants (PDAs) equipped with the MPLS, which
   provided both teachers and students access to plant information while
   in the field. A quasi-experimental research design was used to
   investigate the effectiveness of using the MPLS to support student
   learning. The responses to questionnaires and inter-views indicate that
   students valued the outdoor learning activities made possible by use of
   the PDA and its functions. Pre- and post-test results demonstrated that
   students also benefitted academically from the use of the MPLS and the
   PDA. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main purpose of this paper is to identify factors and conditions
   that are important for successful Implementation of computers in
   Iranian schools during one decade from 1995 to 2005. The second focus
   of this paper is to examine how these factors relate to models of
   implementation in other countries such as developed countries.
   This paper is written based on the results of three studies which had
   been done in 1995, 2000 and 2005. Participants were samples of
   different groups involved in the implementation process during these
   years. The data collected consisted of questionnaires, semi-structured
   interviews, policy documents. The results indicate that some factors
   were reported very important during one decade such as the role of
   situational factors such as traditional societies in transition. The
   most important factors of traditional societies in transition were
   included: socio-economic, socio-cultural factors and political
   stability. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents both the design and the pilot formative evaluation
   study of a computer-based problem-solving environment (named LECGO:
   Learning Environment for programming using C using Geometrical Objects)
   for the learning of computer programming using C by beginners. In its
   design, constructivist and social learning theories were taken into
   account. The general design has taken into consideration models of the
   learning process and subject matter as well as potential learner
   behaviour in dealing with fundamental tasks. The main emphasis has been
   placed on the role of: (a) multiple external representations in student
   learning, (b) motivation, through performing problem-solving activities
   taken from the familiar and meaningful context of drawing, using simple
   geometrical objects, (c) the active participation of students in their
   own learning by using hands-on experience, (d) appropriate feedback on
   the actions taken by students, to aid their self-correction, and (e)
   holistic, activity-based, multi-media, multi-representational and
   multi-layered content for the learning of basic concepts of programming
   using C. LECGO was pilot evaluated in the field through a qualitative
   and comparative study where nine 12th grade (18-year-old) students
   participated. In fact, students faced three similar yet not identical
   sets of four tasks across three learning environments, namely; paper
   and pencil (p-p), Turbo C and LECGO. The data emerging from this field
   evaluation study indicates that students gain better results within
   LECGO than in both the p-p environment and the typical programming
   environment of Turbo C, while performing similar activities. (C) 2009

TI From SCORM to Common Cartridge: A step forward

   methods; Interactive learning environments
AB Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) was proposed as a
   standard for sharable learning object packaging, delivering and
   sequencing. Several years later, Common Cartridge (CC) is proposed as
   an enhancement of SCORM offering more flexibility and addressing needs
   not originally envisioned, namely assessment and web 2.0 standards,
   content authorization, collaborative forums, outcomes reporting,
   accessibility. Educational policy makers, specialists responsible for
   learning systems deployment, educational content authors and teachers
   committed to the learning object paradigm must opt for or coexist with
   two different, partially overlapping proposals for content packaging.
   While SCORM was conceived for self-paced computer based learning,
   Common Cartridge attempts at providing support for all forms of
   teaching and learning with a stress on interactive and collaborative
   environments., Variety of content, distributed content, discussion
   forums, assessment, student's tracking, interaction with external tools
   and authorization to access resources are listed as its main
   enhancements. This article reviews and compares SCORM and Common
   Cartridge from an educational perspective, seeking to provide some
   ground and guidelines on how to stand before these proposals. A simple
   process for authoring a Common Cartridge is described, as well as
   testing and conversion from SCORM. Suggestions are made to education
   practitioners on learning objects standards adoption in the most common
   scenarios. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Student teachers should be prepared to integrate information and
   communication technology (ICT) into their future teaching and learning
   practices. Despite the increased availability and support for ICT
   integration, relatively few teachers intend to integrate ICT into their
   teaching activities (e.g., Ertmer, 2005). The available research has
   thus far mainly focused on isolated teacher related variables to
   explain the weak level of ICT integration. Also, most of this research
   was set up in Western settings. The present study centers on the impact
   of Chinese student teachers' gender, constructivist teaching beliefs,
   teaching self-efficacy, computer self-efficacy, and computer attitudes
   on their prospective ICT use. For this purpose, a survey was set up
   involving student teachers from four Normal Universities in China (N =
   727). Results show that prospective ICT integration significantly
   correlates with all teacher related variables, except for gender.
   Building on the results of a path analysis model, prospective ICT
   integration could be directly predicted on the base of teacher thinking
   variables (constructivist teaching beliefs, teacher self-efficacy,
   computer self-efficacy and computer attitudes in education), and
   indirectly by the gender of the student teachers. Implications for
   teacher education and further research are discussed. Crown Copyright

ID TECHNOLOGY; EDUCATION
AB This paper investigates the use of ICT by teachers in selected
   secondary schools. It considers both the extent and type of use and the
   factors that may influence such use through the statistical analysis of
   data from a 30-section survey containing 185 items. First, exploratory
   maximum-likelihood factor analysis was used to identify five distinct
   categories, or types of use. Second, path analyses assisted in
   determining ten antecedent factors which significantly impacted on use
   from a total of 16 factors considered. These factors were confirmed
   using scale analyses. Finally, a multivariate analysis of variance
   (MANOVA) was used to determine whether demographic/context variables
   were related both to use and to those factors directly influencing
   usage. Findings suggest a variety of types of professional development,
   as well as a range of infrastructural options, are needed to meet not
   only the varying needs of individual teachers, but also the varying
   ways in which ICT can be used. The implication is that the key outcomes
   for any professional development must be to increase teacher confidence
   in their ability to facilitate student learning with computers, along
   with the provision of stronger pedagogical motivation for teachers to
   integrate ICT. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Developing a software environment to enhance 3D geometric proficiency
   demands the consideration of theoretical views of the learning process.
   Simultaneously. this effort requires taking into account the range of
   tools that technology offers, as well as their limitations. In this
   paper, we report on the design of Virtual Spaces 1.0 software, a
   program that exercises the user's abilities to build spatial images and
   to manipulate them. This paper also reports on a study that aimed to
   assess whether those abilities affected achievements in the spatial
   thinking of 10th graders who worked with the software. Additionally, we
   investigated whether self-regulating questions can improve the effect
   of exercising with Virtual Spaces 1.0. The sample was 192 students, who
   were randomly assigned to four groups, two of which used Virtual Spaces
   1.0 (Group I with virtual reality and self-regulating questions N = 52,
   Group 2 with virtual realty only N = 52) and the other two the
   non-Virtual Spaces 1.0 (Group 3 self-regulating questions only N = 45,
   Group 4 non-treatment group N = 45). The results suggest that spatial
   thinking was enhanced by exercising with Virtual Spaces 1.0 and asking
   self-regulating questions. in addition, it was found that the
   self-regulating questions make the use of virtual reality more
   efficient, and that the influence of self-regulating questions is
   especially manifested in tasks that make use of high order skills. (C)

AB Individuals who are anxious about computers may be at a disadvantage in
   their learning. This investigation focused on the use of home computers
   for educational purposes. It compared computer anxiety in adolescents
   with and without a history of special needs related to language
   difficulties, Participants were 55 17-year-olds with specific language
   impairment (SLI) and 72 typically developing (TD) peers. Participants
   completed interviews regarding computer anxiety as well as computer
   importance and computer enjoyment. Measures of psycholinguistic skills,
   perceived ease of use and general anxiety, were also obtained. Results
   showed that adolescents with SLI experience more computer anxiety than
   TD peers and that females are more anxious than males. Level of general
   anxiety, perceived ease of use and language ability had a direct
   association and were predictive of level of computer anxiety in
   adolescents with SILL In contrast, only perceived ease of use was
   significantly predictive in TD adolescents. Gender was not a
   significant predictor in the context of other influential variables.
   The findings reveal a complex relationship between linguistic,
   attitudinal and emotional factors and computer anxiety. Adolescents
   with SLI who are at a greater risk may require multifaceted support for
   a number of influencing factors including general anxiety. (C) 2009

AB Creativity is an important entity in developing human capital while
   computer games are the current generation's contemporary tool. This
   study focused on the teaching of computer games development in order to
   enhance the creative perception of secondary school children. The study
   applied randomised subjects, with control group experimental design,
   which involved 69 Malaysian form one students, aged 13-14 year-old.
   Different pedagogical strategies were being investigated on the
   abilities to enhance students' creative perception. Treatment group
   adopted appreciative learning approach, which was based on Appreciative
   Inquiry (Al) theory. Meanwhile, control group adopted self-paced
   learning, followed by do-it-yourself session. Previous studies
   indicated that although appreciative learning approach is still in its
   infancy development, the approach is gaining its momentum in
   educational settings as it focuses on strengthening a person's
   capacities and potential. Students' creative perception was assessed
   using Khatena-Torrance Creative Perception Inventory (KTCPI). It was
   found students in treatment group gained a mean score of 71.82, which
   was significantly higher at .05 level of significance compared to the
   mean score of 50.49 exhibited by the control group. Yet, both treatment
   and control groups showed significant increases in pre-to-post-test
   scores. Dimensions within KTCPI were further analysed in order to
   present a better picture of students' creative perception. As a
   conclusion, different pedagogical strategy generated different level of
   creative perception enhancement. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The negative impact of online gaming on adolescents has received much
   attention. The question of how to reduce their pathological use of
   online gaming is a critical issue. Based on the concept of external
   justification in dissonance theory, this experimental study aimed to
   examine whether severity of threat and justification of effort would
   impact adolescent players' attitude change toward online gaming, and
   their subjective estimations of online gaming addiction. The results
   echoed predictions from classic studies in dissonance theory. When
   participants engaged in attitude-discrepant behavior, i.e., persuading
   other adolescents that an apparently interesting online game is not fun
   at all, their attitudes toward online gaming shifted more dramatically
   to the negative side in the context of a low level of threat rather
   than a high level of threat. Additionally, the magnitude of attitude
   change was more prominent when participants exerted more rather than
   less effort to engage in attitude-discrepant behavior. Moreover, a
   similar pattern of participants' evaluations of the likelihood of
   online gaming addiction was also observed. The findings show that
   dissonance theory has the potential to be useful for inducing
   adolescent players to disengage in online gaming. (C) 2009 Elsevier

DE CMs; Moodle
ID MOODLE
AB Web resources in Latin American higher education institutions have been
   reported to show a much stronger emphasis on Information than on
   Communication. A Course Management System (CMS), according to Social
   Constructivism framework, is an opportunity for fostering learning
   through interaction in a virtual environment for learning; hence,
   stimulating the use of a CMS for communication purposes seems quite
   appropriate. A quantitative analysis of 63.06% of the virtual
   classrooms was conducted, using the users log database to describe five
   variables: Participation, Informational Interaction Level,
   Communicational Interaction Level, and the use of Informational
   Resources and Communicational Resources in the CMS. An assessment of
   the first 2 years of implementation of Moodle in a campus confirmed
   prominence levels of interaction and resources that favor Information
   over Communication purposes in the use of the CMS. It is not conclusive
   whether this necessarily implies more or better learning; a profound
   qualitative study would be needed to answer these questions. Teachers
   and students show different behaviors in the face of this new ICT
   campus resource, while faculty members appear to have behaved in an
   erratic manner, students show steady levels of CMS usage. (C) 2009

ID TECHNOLOGY; INTERNET; HOME; PERFORMANCE; CHILDREN
AB Examination of the "digital divide" has increasingly gone beyond the
   study of differences in physical access to computers to focus on
   individuals' use of technological tools for empowered and generative
   uses. In this research study, we investigated the relationship between
   access to tools and experience with creative production activities. Our
   participants included 160 8th grade learners from two public middle
   schools. The local communities represented by the two schools differed
   in parent education levels, proportion of recent immigrants, and
   average family income. Findings indicated substantial variability in
   students' history of creative production experiences within both
   communities. Three sets of analyses were completed. First, the two
   school populations were compared with respect to average levels of
   student creative production experience, access to tools at home, use of
   learning resources, frequency of technology use, and access to
   computing outside of their home. Second, correlates of variability in
   individuals' breadth of experience with creative production activities
   were explored across both schools through a regression analysis. The
   resulting model indicated that students' experience was best predicted
   by the number of technology tools available at home, number of learning
   resources used, frequency of computer use at home, and non-home access
   network size. In a third analysis, profiles of experience were created
   based on both breadth and depth of experience; the resulting four
   groups of students were compared. More experienced students utilized a
   broader range of learning resources, had access to more tools at home.
   taught a wider range of people, and were more confident in their
   computing skills. The groups did not differ in their self-reports of
   interest in learning more about technology. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB This paper reports an extended analysis of the study reported in [Wood,
   C. (2005). Beginning readers' use of 'talking books' software can
   affect their reading strategies. Journal of Research in Reading, 28,
   170-182.], in which five and six-year-old children received either six
   sessions using specially designed talking books or six sessions of
   one-to-one tuition with an adult using the paper-based versions of the
   same books. This analysis focuses on the nature of the children's
   interactions with either the adult or the computer in an attempt to
   explore how these different resources impacted on the children's
   literacy interactions, and whether different styles of literacy
   interaction observed within each group were associated with gains in
   phonological awareness or changes in reading strategy. Four styles of
   literacy interaction were identified and there was a significant
   association between these styles and membership of one of the two
   experimental conditions in the study. Interactional style was also seen
   to impact positively on phonological awareness development for lower
   ability children who used the talking books. In contrast, interactional
   style affected changes in reading strategy amongst children in the
   adult tutor condition. Finally, there was also an influence of
   interactional style on spontaneous dialogic reading by the children
   overall, but this effect originated from the children in the adult
   tutor group. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effectiveness of a reading intervention using the whole-word
   multimedia software 'Oxford Reading Tree (ORT) for Clicker' was
   compared to a reading intervention using traditional ORT Big Books.
   Developing literacy skills and attitudes towards learning to read were
   assessed in a group of 17 struggling beginner readers aged 5-6 years.
   Each child was given each of the two interventions, and the order of
   intervention was counterbalanced across the group. Each intervention
   was integrated into the literacy hour over five consecutive days.
   Measures of written word recognition, written word naming, phonological
   awareness and attitudes towards computers were taken before and after
   each intervention. Significant gains in performance were found
   following both interventions for all of the literacy measures, but
   significantly greater gains in written word recognition and enjoyment
   of instruction were found following the Clicker than Big Book
   intervention. These results suggest that whole-word multimedia software
   could be a useful classroom aid for supporting early literacy skills in
   children who are struggling with learning to read. (C) 2009 Elsevier

AB Many companies have pursued innovation to obtain a competitive edge.
   Thus, educational reform focuses mainly on training creative students.
   This study adopted the concept of an affiliated network of projects to
   investigate how project embeddedness influences project team
   creativity. This work surveys 60 projects in a Management Information
   Systems Department of a University. Validity of the specific study
   hypotheses is tested by using moderate hierarchical regression analysis
   to determine how project embeddedness affects project team creativity
   and assess how the team innovation climate moderates the relationships
   between project embeddedness and project team creativity. Analytical
   results indicate a positive association between structural embeddedness
   and project team creativity, a negative relationship between positional
   embeddedness and project team creativity, and a positive influence of
   team innovation climate on the relationships between network
   embeddedness and project team creativity. An attempt is also made to
   understand the role of positional embeddedness by classifying the
   interactions based on the content of interactions. According to those
   results, positional embeddedness is positively related to project team
   creativity during problem-identification interaction: during
   solution-design interaction, positional embeddedness is negatively
   related to project team creativity. Results of this study explain the
   phenomena of divergent thinking and convergent thinking during creative
   development. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

AB Within only a few years, the use of e-learning has increased rapidly in
   Austria. In certain subjects, up to 60% of university students report
   using e-learning platforms at least 'sometimes' or 'frequently' (Unger
   & Wroblewski, 2006). Yet, which aspects of e-learning do students
   consider important for their learning achievements and course
   satisfaction? This question was addressed by surveying 2196 students
   from 29 universities in Austria about their expectations of, and
   experiences in e-learning. Multiple regression analyses using Mplus
   4.21 were carried out to investigate how different facets of students'
   expectations and experiences are related to perceived learning
   achievements and course satisfaction.
   With regard to their expectations, i.e., aspects of a course they
   consider important,, students' achievement goals were the best
   predictors for success and ranked higher than other course
   characteristics. With regard to their experiences, students'
   assessments of the instructor's expertise in e-learning, and her/his
   counseling and support were the best predictors for learning
   achievement and course satisfaction. Furthermore, self-regulated and
   collaborative learning were related to learning achievements. The
   results of the study suggest to influence students' motivation and
   goals by adapting instruction accordingly and emphasize the importance
   of continuing education and training for the instructors. (C) 2009

AB In this study, we examined how high-school students utilized a
   hypermedia learning environment (HLE) to acquire declarative knowledge
   of a historical topic, as well as historical thinking skills. In
   particular, we were interested in whether self-regulated learning (SRL;
   Winne & Hadwin, 1998; Zimmerman, 2000) processing was related to the
   acquisition of declarative knowledge and historical thinking. We found
   that, using the HLE, participants did learn from pretest to posttest,
   and that they most often engaged in strategy use SRL processes.
   However, the frequency of participant use of planning SRL processes,
   not strategy use, was predictive of learning. This study has
   implications for how educators use HLEs to foster historical thinking
   skills, and suggests that scaffolding planning skills may facilitate
   students' use of computers as cognitive and metacognitive tools for
   learning (Azevedo, 2005: Lajoie, 2000). (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB This study investigated whether the instruction of visual design
   principles had an influence on pre-service teachers' perception and
   analysis (interpretation) of visual materials. In addition, the
   relationships between pre-service teachers' visual intelligence and
   their perception and analysis (interpretation) of visual materials were
   also explored. Participants were 86 pre-service teachers who took a
   one-credit required educational technology course at a mid-western
   university in the United States. Some participants were absent in the
   weeks when data were collected, resulting in a total of 59 responses
   included in data analysis. Findings implied that the instruction of
   visual design principles could possibly improve pre-service teachers'
   visual literacy. Suggestions for future research were discussed. (C)

ID SELF-EFFICACY
AB This research investigated the application of knowledge maps in
   e-learning materials design and hypothesized that knowledge maps would
   be more effective than e-learning in general at improving the
   performance and satisfaction of e-learning. In order to test the
   hypotheses, we conducted an experiment with 175 participants and
   randomly assigned them into knowledge map-based and browse-based
   groups. Both groups of participants needed to acquire specific skills
   and knowledge to write the target ADO.NET program. In the end of each
   training session subjects received an assessment to understand their
   learning score, satisfaction level, and computer self-efficacy. Our
   statistical analysis result showed that knowledge map-based learning
   group outperformed browse-based group in these three measurements.
   Thus, the proposed hypotheses were supported. We concluded that if
   knowledge map-based materials design approach were employed novice
   users would acquire the ADO.NET programming in a more effective manner.
   In addition, the satisfaction and computer self-efficacy of users could
   be improved substantially as a result of knowledge map-based materials
   design approach.
   Thus, we propose that if knowledge maps are employed to adequately
   present the relationships of learning contents that knowledge could be
   better understood and learning performance could be improved. (C) 2009

AB The general aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that students
   belonging to a school online community would show higher levels of both
   offline bridging and bonding social capital than a control group of
   students, not using the online community. We further hypothesized that
   the more students used the online community the higher their level of
   their offline bonding and bridging social capital. Participants were
   264 high school boys and girls, 126, (62 males and 64 females) who had
   joined the community online Spallanzani shout and 138.(62 males and 76
   females) who did not. ANOVAs analysis showed that levels of bridging
   and bonding social capitals were significantly higher for members.
   Instead intensity of use was significantly related only to bridging but
   not to bonding social capital. Implications of the findings and
   directions for future research are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB It has been advocated that pedagogical content knowledge as well as
   subject matter knowledge are important for improving classroom
   instructions. To develop pedagogical content knowledge, it is argued
   that understanding of students' mental representations of concepts is
   deemed necessary. Yet assessing and comparing mental model of each
   individual is very tedious and time consuming. This study attempted to
   use gender and learning styles to associate mental models in learning
   sorting algorithm. The Gregorc Style Delineator (GSD) was used to
   measure learning styles of the participants. Mental models were
   assessed using the Pathfinder Scaling Algorithm (PSA). Results
   indicated that females showed greater similarity in mental models than
   males and concrete learners also exhibited closer resemblance to the
   expert mental model than abstract learners. These suggest that gender
   and learning styles can be meaningfully used to associate mental models
   in order to provide a group-based instead of individual-based diagnosis
   and thus promote conceptual change in learning. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent developments in computing and mobile technologies have enabled
   the mobile and ubiquitous teaming approach, which situates students in
   an environment that combines real-world and digital-world learning
   resources. Although such an approach seems to be innovative and
   interesting, several problems have been revealed when applying it to
   practical learning activities. One major problem is owing to the lack
   of proper learning strategies or tools that can guide or assist the
   students to learn in such a complex learning scenario. Students might
   feel excited or interested when using the mobile devices to learn in
   the real world; however, their learning achievements could be
   disappointing. To cope with this problem, in this study, a knowledge
   engineering approach is proposed to develop Mindtools for such
   innovative learning scenarios. Experimental results from a natural
   science course of an elementary school show that this innovative
   approach not only enhances learning motivation, but also improves the
   learning achievements of the students. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have become an
   integral component of Physical Education (PE) and Sport Science (SS)
   curricula and professions. It is thus imperative that PE and SS
   students develop ICT skills, self-efficacy in ICT and positive
   attitudes towards ICT. This study was aimed at designing a computer
   literacy course targeted at equipping PE and SS students with core ICT
   skills, and at evaluating its impact on students' computer and Internet
   self-efficacy, attitudes towards computers and the Internet, and
   computer anxiety. The study also explored students' responses to the
   course, students' perceptions of the relevance of ICT for PE and SS
   professionals as well as eventual differences in the course's impact in
   relation to students' prior ICT experience. Participants were 89 PE and
   SS undergraduate students. Both quantitative and qualitative data were
   gathered through pretest/posttest questionnaires and transcripts of an
   online discussion forum. Data analysis showed that the course
   significantly enhanced students' computer and Internet self-efficacy
   and their positive attitudes towards computers and the Internet, while
   significantly reducing their computer anxiety. The course was very
   well-received by the students, who were found to fully perceive the
   pervasiveness of ICT in today's PE and SS professions, and who felt
   that they had developed valuable ICT skills. The course elicited
   positive responses regardless of students' prior ICT experience,
   although it had significantly more positive effects, in terms of
   computer self-efficacy, Internet self-efficacy and computer attitudes,
   with the students who were most in need of the course, namely those
   with low prior ICT experience. The findings are discussed in relation
   to training PE and SS students in ICT within academic settings. (C)

AB Essays are an important measure of complex learning, but pronouns can
   confound an author's intended meaning for both readers and text
   analysis software. This descriptive investigation considers the effect
   of pronouns on a computer-based text analysis approach, ALA-Reader,
   which uses students' essays as the data source for deriving individual
   and group knowledge representations. Participants in an undergraduate
   business course (n = 45) completed an essay as part of the course final
   examination. The investigators edited the essays to replace the most
   common pronouns (their, it, and they) with the appropriate referent.
   The original unedited and the edited essays were processed with
   ALA-Reader using two different approaches, sentence and linear
   aggregate. These data were then analyzed using a Pathfinder network
   approach. The average group network similarity values comparing the
   original to the edited essays were large (i.e., about 90% overlap) but
   the linear aggregate approach obtained larger values than the sentence
   aggregate approach. The linear aggregate approach also provided a
   better measure of individual essay scores (e.g., r = 0.74 with
   composite rater scores). This data provides some support that the
   ALA-Reader linear approach is adequate for capturing group knowledge
   structure representations from essays. Further development of the
   ALA-Reader approach is warranted.

AB Although learning styles are considered as an important factor in
   education, students often have to learn in courses that do not support
   their learning styles. A challenge for technology facilitated learning
   is therefore to assist and help students to cope with courses that do
   not match their learning styles by training and developing their less
   preferred skills. In this paper, the interactions between students'
   learning styles, their behaviour, and their performance in an online
   course that is mismatched regarding their learning styles were
   analysed. The results show which learners need more help in mastering
   mismatched courses, help in getting a better understanding about how
   students with good performance record and poor performance record learn
   with respect to their learning styles, and provide information about
   how to identify learners who might have difficulties in learning based
   on their behaviour.

AB The following empirical study examines the acquisition of expertise.
   The model structures in the domain of empirical methodologies were
   examined in a time period of two semesters. At each measurement point
   (N = 5), the model structures of the reference groups were compared
   with those of the group of learners. The group of learners consisted of
   (N = 31) students who did not have any experience with research methods
   and their theoretical foundations. The results indicate that the
   external criteria enabled a precise assessment of learning dependent
   model change.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the development of the
   metacognitive knowledge of a group of higher education students who
   participated actively in an experiment based on a Computer Supported
   Collaborative Learning environment called KnowCat. Eighteen university
   students participated in a 12-month learning project during which the
   KnowCat learning environment was used to support scaffolding process
   among equals during problem-solving tasks. After using KnowCat, the
   students were interviewed over their work in this shared workspace.
   Qualitative analysis revealed that the educational application of
   KnowCat can favour and improve the development of metacognitive
   knowledge.

AB Much research has focused on student views about physics concepts, with
   an emphasis on the identification of alternative conceptions, and how
   curricula and professional development may ameliorate the situation.
   However, there has been little work on determining the extent of, and
   in separating, the student and teacher/classroom level variables that
   may impact student physics achievement. This study examined the effect
   of different student and teacher/classroom level variables on student
   understanding of physics concepts using hierarchical linear modeling
   (HLM), a regression based technique. The data were collected from 68
   different teachers and 3,119 students who were using a reform
   Curriculum, Active Physics. Teachers and students completed surveys
   asking about their beliefs, their classes and their personal
   characteristics. Students also completed a physics achievement test.
   The data show that students of teachers who used Active Physics for a
   greater portion of the year scored higher on the achievement test than
   did students of teachers who did not use the curriculum as much.
   Furthermore, the data show that the achievement gap was narrowed
   between boys and girls and between students with different attitudes
   toward physics. Additionally teachers who received inservice
   instruction on how to implement Active Physics narrowed the gap between
   students with different views of their classroom involvement. (C) 2009

AB Reform efforts have emphasized the need to support teachers' learning
   about reform-oriented practices. Educative curriculum materials are one
   potential vehicle for promoting teacher learning about these practices.
   Educative curriculum materials include supports that are intended to
   promote both student and teacher learning. However, little is known
   about the extent to which existing curriculum materials provide support
   for teachers and the ways they can be improved. In this study, eight
   sets of high school biology curriculum materials were reviewed to
   determine their potential for promoting teacher learning. Design
   heuristics for educative curriculum materials were adapted for use as
   evaluation criteria. From this analysis, several themes emerged. First,
   the materials tended to provide support for teachers' subject matter
   knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge for students' ideas (e.g.,
   misconceptions) but rarely for their pedagogical content knowledge of
   scientific inquiry. Second, the materials contained several
   implementation guidance supports but far fewer rationales for
   instructional decisions, which are an important feature of educative
   curriculum materials. Finally, the quality of support varied widely,
   differing in its degree of relevance, pedagogical helpfulness, and
   depth. The article concludes with recommendations for the redesign of
   existing curriculum materials. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res

AB Nearly 6,000 science questions collected from five different web-based,
   TV-based and school-based sources were rigorously analyzed in order to
   identify profiles of K-12 Students' interest in science, and how these
   profiles change with age. The questions were analyzed according to
   their topic, thinking level, motivation for and level of autonomy in
   raising the question, the object of interest and its magnitude, and
   psychological distance of the object in question from the asker.
   Characteristics of the asker, such as gender, grade level, and country
   of origin were also considered, alongside characteristics of the data
   source, such its language, setting (Internet, school, TV), and the
   potential science-attentiveness of the users. Six meta-clusters of
   children's and adolescents' interest in science were identified using
   cluster analysis of their self-generated science questions. A
   developmental shift in interest from non-classical to classical school
   science subjects was noted. Other age-related developments, such as an
   increase in thinking level as reflected by the questions. a decrease in
   organization level and the psychological distance of the object in
   question with age were also explored. Advantages and shortcomings of
   web-based data collection for educational research are discussed, as
   are the implications of the results obtained using this methodology for
   formal science education. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci

AB Studying complex systems is increasingly important in many science
   domains. Many features of complex systems make it difficult for
   Students to develop deep understanding. Our previous research indicated
   that a function-centered conceptual representation is part of the
   disciplinary toolbox of biologists, suggesting that it is an
   appropriate representation to help students develop deep understanding.
   This article reports on the results of two experiments that investigate
   how hypermedia using a conceptual representation influences pre-service
   teachers' and middle school students' learning of a complex biological
   system, the human respiratory system. We designed two versions of
   instructional hypermedia based on the structure-behavior-function
   conceptual representation. One hypermedia was function-centered which
   emphasized the function and behavior of the system, whereas the other
   was focused on the structure of the system. We contrasted the
   instructional effectiveness of these two alternative conceptual
   represent at ions. The results of both studies indicated that
   participants using the function-centered hypermedia developed deeper
   understanding than those using the structure-centered version. This
   proof-of-concept study suggests that the function-centered conceptual
   representation is a powerful way to promote complex systems
   understanding. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 46:

AB This study focuses on the structure and theoretical foundations of the
   book club for promoting multicultural understandings in science teacher
   education. The book club was defined as an informal, peer-directed
   group discussion that met regularly to discuss an ethnographic,
   multicultural text regarding issues pertinent to science teaching and
   learning in urban classrooms. Twenty-three preservice teachers (PSTs)
   enrolled in a 16-week elementary science methods course at a large
   urban university participated in the study. From the qualitative
   analyses of PSTs' written reflections and researcher journal notes,
   five themes which emphasize Individual, Collaborative, and Collective
   learning are presented. These findings highlight how the book club
   structure and theoretical foundation fostered critical, reflective
   inquiry and served as a method for effecting ideological change which
   is needed in order to embrace issues of diversity in urban science
   education. Implications for science teacher education concerning the
   relevancy of pedagogical strategies, the use of multiple theoretical
   perspectives, and the book club as a strategy in teacher education and
   urban education are discussed. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res

ID VOCABULARY
AB This study addressed the role of electronic pocket dictionaries as a
   language learning tool among university students in Hong Kong and
   Taiwan. The target groups included engineering and humanities students
   at both undergraduate and graduate level. Speed of reference was found
   to be the main motivator for using an electronic pocket dictionary.
   Next, the functionality used was found to be connected to the language
   proficiency of the learner. Finally, multimedia content was ranked
   least important. The results of this study have implications for the
   design of electronic dictionaries and for the teaching of second
   languages with electronic dictionaries. In particular, device
   developers should focus on improving the accessing speed and pay less
   attention to multimedia functionality. Educators should ensure that the
   device functionality matches the language proficiency level of the
   students.

AB This paper reported the results of a study that aimed to construct a
   sensor and handheld augmented reality (AR)-supported ubiquitous
   learning (u-learning) environment called the Handheld English Language
   Learning Organization (HELLO), which is geared towards enhancing
   students' language learning. The HELLO integrates sensors, AR,
   ubiquitous computing and information technologies. It is composed of
   two subsystems: an English learning management system and a u-learning
   tool. In order to evaluate the effects of the proposed learning
   environment on the learning performance of students, a case study on
   English learning was conducted on a school campus. The participants
   included high school teachers and students. A learning course entitled
   'My Campus' was conducted in the class; it included three activities,
   namely 'Campus Environment', 'Campus Life' and 'Campus Story'. The
   evaluation results showed that the proposed HELLO and the learning
   activities could improve the students' English listening and speaking
   skills.

AB This research draws upon community of practice theory to explore the
   factors that enabled or hindered participation in an online
   'Foundations of Communities of Practice' workshop - a course that is
   designed to align with Wenger's communities of practice perspective.
   The research used a mixed methods approach, drawing upon log-on and
   posting data, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews to explore
   participant experiences. The findings show that five dimensions either
   enabled or constrained participation. These were emotion, technology,
   connectivity, understanding norms and learning tensions. As enablers
   these dimensions led to successful participation within an online
   community of practice, but as constraints, they led to peripheral
   participation. The findings highlight implications for tutors of such
   courses. These include the need to (1) assess the technical expertise
   of participants, particularly when a number of different technological
   tools are used; (2) find ways to identify and evaluate emotional
   responses so learners can be supported in managing these; (3) ensure
   that participants understand the norms of a community; and (4) develop
   clear induction materials and processes.

AB The paper describes a study conducted in Rwanda involving 12
   participants selected from a larger cohort of 24 final-year university
   students who were part of a group-based training programme. The
   programme was about how to search, retrieve, and use web-based
   literature. Empirical data were collected through interviews and focus
   group discussions. The purpose was to explore ways of using information
   and communication technology (ICT) in student teachers' everyday
   learning practice. The study draws from a sociocultural perspective and
   emphasis is put on a literature review involving ICT in teacher
   education. The findings reveal that utilization of ICT pertains to
   three major types of variation among student teachers who use ICT:
   passive, reluctant, and active users. The active ICT users demonstrated
   a capacity to cross group boundaries and play a central role as agents
   of change in learning practice. The point is that more experienced
   student teachers can assist their colleagues in the zone of proximal
   development and, therefore, enhance the integration of the new
   technology in teacher education. This implies that having access to ICT
   together with some instruction is not sufficient to prompt students to
   start using this technology as a pedagogical tool. Moreover,
   confrontation of different experiences regarding the use of ICT can
   spearhead change in student teachers' learning practice through
   critical reflection.

   (as an internal, individual process) and knowledge building (as the
   creation of public knowledge) are based on the interplay between an
   individual's knowledge and the information available in the wiki.
   Incongruity between individual knowledge and the information contained
   in the wiki will lead to learning (through the acquisition of factual
   and conceptual knowledge) and to knowledge building (through
   assimilation and accommodation). In three conditions, the experiment
   provided the participants with different levels of incongruity between
   their individual knowledge and information in the wiki by varying the
   amount of information that was contained in the wiki, while the amount
   of information that the participants possessed was kept constant. As
   predicted, the results confirmed that a medium level of incongruity
   between an individual's knowledge and the information that a wiki
   contains will best support learning. Moreover, a medium level of
   incongruity leads to more accommodative knowledge building despite the
   fact that high and medium levels of incongruity will result in similar
   amounts of assimilative knowledge building. The implications of these
   findings were discussed in the concluding remarks.

AB Previous research has examined factors influencing teacher decisions to
   integrate technology using between-teacher designs. This study used a
   within-teacher design to compare students who were assigned multi-media
   learning objects for learning fractions with students taught by the
   same teachers who were not assigned to the technology. There were two
   conditions: (1) teachers were asked to limit the number of assigned
   students to 25% of their class (N = 375 grade 7-10 students) and (2)
   teachers could assign as many students as they wanted (N = 149 grade 7
   students). In the constrained decision setting, students assigned to
   the technology were more likely than students not assigned to score
   lower on a fractions achievement test, have dysfunctional attitudes
   towards mathematics learning, have low self-efficacy, exert low effort,
   and be male. In the unconstrained decision setting, 70% of students
   were assigned the technology and the only statistically significant
   predictor was prior achievement. Teachers' criteria were congruent with
   research identifying correlates of mathematics achievement and comfort
   with technology.

AB This paper deals with a course intended to teach individuals a method
   of convergent thinking, or 'idea focusing', in seeking inventive
   solutions to problems and designing innovative artefacts. The course
   participants (mathematics, science, or technology teachers) learned a
   range of 'inventive principles' often used for problem-solving in
   scientific and technological environments. The research method combined
   quantitative and qualitative methods, such as observations, pre-post
   course quizzes, and interviews, aimed at collecting as much information
   as possible on students' activities, achievements, and attitudes during
   the course. The results indicated that the participants gradually
   increased their confidence in utilising the method and combined several
   techniques in solving a problem. They also increasingly recognised that
   many inventive ideas are based on simple principles that can be learned
   and applied in diverse contexts. The question of introducing the
   learning of inventive problem-solving into the school curriculum,
   however, requires additional research.

   pedagogy of horizontal conjunctures; indigenous communities; social

AB This article introduces case studies of innovative approaches to
   pedagogy among indigenous Mayan communities in Chiapas (Mexico) and
   Lencan communities in Intibuca (Honduras). Innovative approaches to
   researching alternative theories and practices of pedagogy are used by
   the author to develop an epistemology of critical pedagogy and its
   potential contribution to the creation of a dignified society. From the
   humanistic point of view these experiments in pedagogy are invaluable
   practices of cultural capital that resonate in a broader social and
   political environment. Cultural capital represents the power for social
   integration and cohesion beyond capitalism, produces new social
   relations, and contributes to the creation of an egalitarian society
   with greater social welfare. Pedagogy plays a fundamental role in this
   social production because it leads to social change. The author
   indicates the possibilities of an education that runs counter to the
   currently prevailing model of education in wealthy states as well as
   opening new reflections and challenges for contemporary pedagogy.

AB In this paper, the authors present and evaluate a partially web-based
   Basic Optics course held each year from 2000 to 2003. The course has
   evolved over the last four years, and we analyse this process based on
   students' responses to a paper-based questionnaire. Their responses
   show the difficulty they had in adapting to this new environment, in
   which they are required to actively participate in their learning
   process. One positive aspect that has been brought to our attention as
   teachers is that it is necessary to reflect on the learning model we
   would like to introduce. In other words, the focus has shifted from the
   course contents to designing effective teaching and learning processes.

AB Supplemental Instruction has a long history of effective use in third
   level education in the United States. However, there are few rigorously
   controlled studies in which the potentially confounding effects of
   student aptitude and experience and of 'volunteer effects' have been
   controlled. Analysis of the effects of peer assisted learning in the
   context of the higher educational system of the UK and Ireland is
   relatively sparse, with few rigorously controlled studies, and it is
   therefore difficult to quantify its impact. I carried out a carefully
   controlled study of the effects of peer assisted learning by second
   year students with first year students. Prior to tutoring, the tutored
   and non-tutored groups were very evenly matched. However, after one
   semester of tutoring there were substantial and significant differences
   between the tutored and non-tutored students. The tutored students
   progressively increased their performance at in-house tests in calculus
   compared to the untutored students, their examination marks in
   chemistry and calculus substantially improved (13%) and failure rates
   were cut dramatically. Student progression was substantially improved.

AB The purpose of the present study was to relate the findings of a survey
   of learning styles and multiple intelligences that was distributed
   among two different cultural groups of Freshman-level EFL students in
   Taiwan and Kuwait in order to confirm its consistency for developing
   teaching techniques appropriate for each group's general profiles. Data
   collection consisted of a survey adopted from two standardised
   instruments. Part one of the survey targeted the students' preferred
   learning styles and part two was focused on multiple intelligences.
   Data analysis identified the dominant learning styles and multiple
   intelligences in each group. Implications were drawn for conducting
   other cross-cultural studies in EFL settings in order to develop
   teaching techniques that accommodate each cultural group and to design
   teaching tasks and activities that expand the two groups' present
   learning styles and intelligences.

AB The virtual laboratories developed by a life sciences department at a
   public university in the US were designed for use by college students
   enrolled in an introductory biology course. The results analyses
   conducted to examine their effectiveness indicated that self-selected
   users of the virtual laboratories outperformed non-users on laboratory
   practical exams and on items relevant to the laboratories included on
   the final practical exam but not on the final exam or other tests. A
   second comparison of two groups of users and non-users, matched by
   their results on the first hourly exam confirmed the findings. The
   finding that the users were more successful than the non-users could
   not be supported by a conclusion that the students had initial
   differences in quality. The results were replicated in a second
   semester, virtual laboratories-relevant final exam items, but not on
   the final exam or other tests. Users expressed positive attitudes
   toward the virtual laboratories.

   Assistants (PDAs) were used as the platform to support high-school
   teachers. Based on concepts of Electronic Performance Support Systems
   and design-based research, the authors conducted an iterative process
   of analysis, design, development, and evaluation. Besides the data
   collected from the two initial users during the iterative process, 12
   teachers were recruited for evaluating the functions and interface
   design of the UPSST. The participants mostly reported positive
   attitudes toward the functions and interface, but some expressed
   concerns. Explanations of the concerns and suggestions for future
   studies are provided.

   of Science Education, Science Education, and the Journal of Research in
   Science Teaching from 1998 to 2002 were analysed in terms of author's
   nationality, research type, and research topic. In the present study a
   total of 869 papers published in the three journals from 2003 to 2007
   were analysed, and the results were compared with those of Tsai and
   Wen. Moreover, this study also identified 31 highly-cited papers
   published during 1998-2002 and 20 highly-cited papers published during
   2003-2007. The results showed that authors from countries other than
   the four major English-speaking countries (i.e., the USA, the UK,
   Australia, and Canada) published an increasing number of articles in
   the past decade. During these five years (2003-2007), science educators
   showed relatively more interest in research topics involving the
   context of student learning. Besides, science educators have changed
   some of their research interests during 1998-2007, with a shift in the
   research topics from student conception learning and conceptual change
   (1998-2002) to student learning contexts (2003-2007). Moreover, the
   investigation of highly-cited papers in the past decade revealed that
   studies on argumentation have gained significant attention among
   science educators.

ID CHEMICAL-CHANGE; STUDENTS CONCEPTIONS; SCIENCE-EDUCATION; CHEMISTRY;
   SUBSTANCES
AB The present paper discusses the conceptual demands of an apparently
   straightforward task set to secondary-level students-completing
   chemical word equations with a single omitted term. Chemical equations
   are of considerable importance in chemistry, and school students are
   expected to learn to be able to write and interpret them. However, it
   is recognised that many students find them challenging. The present
   paper explores students' accounts of their attempts to identify the
   missing terms, to illuminate why working with chemical word equations
   is so challenging from the learner's perspective. Three hundred
   secondary-age students responded to a five-item exercise based on
   chemicals and types of reactions commonly met at school level. For each
   item they were asked to identify the missing term in a word equation,
   and to explain their answers. This provided a database containing more
   than 1,000 student accounts of their rationales. Analysis of the data
   led to the identification of seven main classes of strategy used to
   answer the questions. Most approaches required the coordination of
   chemical knowledge at several different levels for a successful
   outcome; and there was much evidence both for correct answers based on
   flawed chemical thinking, and appropriate chemical thinking being
   insufficient to lead to the correct answer. It is suggested that the
   model reported here should be tested by more in-depth methods, but
   could help chemistry teachers appreciate learners' difficulties and
   offer them explicit support in selection and application of strategies
   when working with chemical equations.

   pre-test and post-test design was used, involving two treatment groups
   and one control group. One of the experimental groups received a
   science module incorporating movie clips (i.e., the movie group). The
   other experimental group received the same science module, but only
   news report clips were used (i.e., the news report group). Prior to and
   after the module, 266 secondary school students completed a
   questionnaire to test their opinion-forming skills. The results
   demonstrate that the science module had a significant positive effect
   on students' opinion-forming skills and that the movie group improved
   their skills more compared with the news report group. It may be
   concluded that the use of fiction-to be more specific, movie clips
   about genomics extracted from feature films-to introduce a
   socio-scientific issue in the classroom stimulates students to develop
   their opinion-forming skills.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB The present paper describes the design of teaching materials that are
   used as learning tools in school visits to a science museum. An
   exhibition on 'A century of the Special Theory of Relativity', in the
   Kutxaespacio Science Museum, in San Sebastian, Spain, was used to
   design a visit for first-year engineering students at the university
   and assess the learning that was achieved. The first part of the paper
   presents the teaching sequence that was designed to build a bridge
   between formal teaching and the exhibition visit. The second part
   analyses the potential of the exhibition and the aforementioned
   teaching sequence to influence the students' knowledge of three aspects
   of the Special Theory of Relativity. The results obtained show that the
   design of the visit, with both pre-visit and follow-up activities, was
   effective as a means of increasing students' understanding and
   stimulating their ability to argue scientifically.

   Understandings

LA English
DT Article
ID ELEMENTARY TEACHERS CONCEPTIONS; SPATIAL ABILITY; SEX-DIFFERENCES;
   STUDENTS; PHASES
AB This paper reports an examination on gender differences in lunar phases
   understanding of 123 students (70 females and 53 males). Middle-level
   students interacted with the Moon through observations, sketching,
   journalling, two-dimensional and three-dimensional modelling, and
   classroom discussions. These lunar lessons were adapted from the
   Realistic Explorations in Astronomical Learning (REAL) curriculum.
   Students' conceptual understandings were measured through analysis of
   pre-test and post-test results on a Lunar Phases Concept Inventory
   (LPCI) and a Geometric Spatial Assessment (GSA). The LPCI was used to
   assess conceptual learning of eight science and four mathematics
   domains. The GSA was used to assess learning of the same four
   mathematical domains; however, the GSA test items were not posed within
   a lunar context. Results showed both male and female groups to make
   significant gains in understanding on the overall LPCI test scores as
   well as significant gains on five of the eight science domains and on
   three of the four mathematics domains. The males scored significantly
   higher than the females on the science domain, phase-Sun/Earth/Moon
   positions, and on the mathematics domain geometric spatial
   visualisation. GSA results found both male and female groups achieving
   a significant increase in their test scores on the overall GSA. Females
   made significant gains on the GSA mathematics domains, periodic
   patients and cardinal directions, while males made significant gains on
   only the periodic patterns domain. Findings suggest that both
   scientific and mathematical understandings can be significantly
   improved for both sexes through the use of spatially focused,
   inquiry-oriented curriculum such as REAL.

AB Based on the analysis of available research on students' alternative
   conceptions about the particulate nature of matter, we identified basic
   implicit assumptions that seem to constrain students' ideas and
   reasoning on this topic at various learning stages. Although many of
   these assumptions are interrelated, some of them seem to change or
   lose/gain strength independently from one another. Overlapping or
   competing presuppositions about the structure, properties, and dynamics
   of matter may be able to coexist at any given level, particularly at
   intermediate stages of expertise. Our results allowed us to suggest
   common paths in the transition from naive through novice to expert
   along relevant dimensions related to the structure and properties of
   chemical substances. The identification of these cognitive constraints
   provides a useful framework that educators can use to better understand
   and even predict many of their students' learning difficulties. It can
   also assist in the design and organisation of learning experiences and
   assessment tools that recognise and take advantage of the most likely
   trajectories towards expertise (learning progressions) followed by many
   students.

AB Education researchers have amply documented the beneficial effects of
   help seeking on learning and understanding. Requesting help from
   teachers (or other human sources) when faced with a difficult task is
   now considered a self-regulated learning strategy. In a related domain,
   information search refers to learner-initiated efforts to obtain
   further task-related information from books or other non-human sources
   when undertaking an assignment. The integration of human and
   information-based resources in information and communication technology
   (ICT) tends to blur the distinction between help seeking and
   information searching, thus offering new perspectives on the study of
   the processes and skills involved in these activities. The aim of this
   paper is to redefine the boundaries between help seeking and
   information searching, by replacing the dichotomous definition (i.e.,
   human versus non-human sources) by a more integrative theoretical
   framework. Beyond the obvious theoretical importance of the issue,
   clarifying the boundaries between seeking help and searching for
   information may contribute to the development of more effective forms
   of human and non-human support for technology-enhanced learning
   environments. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Offering help functions is a standard feature of computer-based
   interactive learning environments (ILE). Nevertheless, a number of
   recent studies indicate that learners are not using such help
   facilities effectively. We compared the effects of different
   metacognitive supports to foster learners' help-seeking behavior in an
   ILE for plant identification. Four groups of university students (n =
   51), each receiving a different metacognitive instruction, had to
   determine living plants. They had to think-aloud and were video
   recorded during the experiment. At the end of the session they
   completed a knowledge test. The surprising effect was that students in
   all groups were effective help-seekers. They adapted their help-seeking
   behavior to the complexity of the plants in an effective way. The
   results indicate that for students on university level effective
   help-seeking seems to depend largely on motivational factors. (C) 2008

AB Throughout their lives, people are faced with various learning
   situations, for example when they learn how to use new software,
   services or information systems. However, research in the field of
   Interactive Learning Environments shows that learners needing
   assistance do not systematically seek or use help, even when it is
   available. The aim of the present study is to explore the role of some
   factors from research in Interactive Learning Environments in another
   situation: using a new technology not as a means of acquiring knowledge
   but to realize a specific task. Firstly, we present the three factors
   included in this study (I) the role of the content of assistance,
   namely operative vs. function-oriented help: (2) the role of the user's
   prior knowledge; (3) the role of the trigger of assistance, i.e. help
   provided after the user's request vs. help provided by the system. In
   this latter case, it is necessary to detect the user's difficulties. On
   the basis of research on problem-solving, we list behavioral criteria
   expressing the user's difficulties. Then, we present two experiments
   that use "real" technologies developed by a large company and tested by
   "real" users. The results showed that (1) even when participants had
   reached an impasse, most of them never sought assistance, (2) operative
   assistance that was automatically provided by the system was effective
   for novice users, and (3) function-oriented help that was automatically
   provided by the system was effective for expert users. Assistance can
   support deadlock awareness and can also focus on deadlock solving by
   guiding task. Assistance must be adapted to prior knowledge, progress
   and goals of learners to improve learning. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Within the context of a Europe-wide project UNITE, a number of European
   partners set out to design, implement and validate a pedagogical
   framework (PF) for e- and m-Learning in secondary schools. The process
   of formulating and testing the PF was an evolutionary one that
   reflected the experiences and skills of the various European partners
   and secondary schools involved in the project. The framework involved
   pedagogies which underpin the teaching of subject matter in a number of
   European secondary schools as well as the ways in which learning is
   delivered and assessed. The PF represents an essential part of the
   e-Learning system conceptualization and development and offers sound
   concepts for the development of learning scenarios in order to enhance
   the learning experience of students in secondary schools. A
   five-component framework which, by means of its constituents, drives
   and guides the creation of e-Learning scenarios was designed and
   tested. it is composed of the pedagogical framework context,
   pedagogical approaches, assessment techniques, teacher education and
   national specifics and current pedagogical practices implemented in
   national curricula. A series of learning scenarios were created to test
   the PF in classrooms. A detailed exemplar of a scenario in practice is
   offered. An evaluation of the scenarios based on [Reeves, T. C., 1994.
   Evaluating what really matters in computer-based education. In M. Wild,
   D. Kirkpatrick (Eds.), Computer education: new perspectives (pp.
   219-246). Perth, Australia: MASTEC] pedagogical dimensions revealed
   that UNITE is based on constructivist and cognitive foundations. With
   increased experience of the system the teachers' implementation of the
   pedagogical framework developed into increased mastery in the school
   context. Teachers from the second validation phase became more
   confident in their application of the framework principles and
   evaluated more positively the outcomes. This helped them to become more
   aware of the opportunities offered by the framework in their secondary
   school teaching. In order to bring this about the supports for change
   were put into place at the levels of pedagogical design, administrative
   support and the provision of the required resources and appropriate
   continuing professional development. The project has sought to create
   this support structure to ensure maximal benefits of the system for
   teaching and learning. Such a pedagogical support PF has offered scope
   for both collaborative and autonomous learning which have brought about
   value-added teaching and learning effects in the Europe-wide network of
   schools. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main purpose of the study was to address the association between
   computer games and students' academic achievement. The exceptional
   growth in numbers of children playing computer games, the uneasiness
   and incomplete understanding foundation when starting the discussion on
   computer games have stimulated this study to be conducted. From a
   survey conducted on 236 form one students in one of the Malaysian
   secondary school, 75.8 percent were gamers. Playing computer games
   seemed to be more stereotypically boy's activity with 91.3 percent of
   the boys engaged in computer games compared to 54.1 percent among the
   girls. They spent an average of 8.47 hours per week playing computer
   games. Parents and teachers' concern about computer games was not
   something that went unwarranted as an overall result was predicting
   computer games as having negative associations with students' academic
   achievement. However, in-depth analyses by combinations of classes done
   step by step indicated that the initial results could be overruled by
   students from the last class, whom need extra attentions. As a
   conclusion, the findings in this study suggest some interesting yet
   ultimately weak associations between playing computer games and
   students' academic achievement. Nevertheless, caution is warranted in
   making any generalization as looking at the population as a whole will
   be different from its components. The generalizability of this study's
   findings is limited by the nature of the sample. Even so, blaming
   computer games for the students' bad academic performance in school is
   unjustified as there are many more other factors to look into before
   finding computer games as the scapegoat. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Past research has shown the variations of students' conceptions of
   learning, but little has been especially undertaken to address
   students' conceptions of web-based learning and to make comparisons
   between students' conceptions of learning in general and their
   conceptions of web-based learning in particular. By interviewing 83
   Taiwanese college students with some web-based learning experiences,
   this study attempted to investigate the students' conceptions of
   learning, conceptions of web-based learning, and the differences
   between these conceptions. Using the phenomenographic method of
   analyzing student interview transcripts, several categories of
   conceptions of learning and of web-based learning were revealed. The
   analyses of interview results suggested that the conceptions of
   web-based learning were often more sophisticated than those of
   learning. For example, much more students conceptualized learning in
   web-based context as pursuing real understanding and seeing in a new
   way than those for learning in general. This implies that the
   implementation of web-based instruction may be a potential avenue for
   promoting students' conceptions of learning. By gathering questionnaire
   responses from the students, this study further found that the
   sophistication of the conceptions toward web-based learning was
   associated with better searching strategies as well as higher
   self-efficacy for web-based learning. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB A frequent task in educational settings is to assign students to groups
   based on stated preferences for some projects or topics. This paper
   introduces a web-based tool supporting both the work flow of collecting
   student data and the group formation. The latter is based on finding
   optimal solutions to suitable mathematical assignment problems,
   allowing for a number of constraints regarding size and structure of
   the groups. Evaluation results show advantages compared to manual
   procedures in terms of time savings for lecturers, and higher fairness
   and correctness as perceived by students. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

TI Anatomy of a mobilized lesson: Learning my way

AB With the mass adoption of mobile computing devices by the current
   school generation, significant opportunities have emerged for genuinely
   supporting differentiated and personalized learning experiences through
   mobile devices. In our school-based research work in introducing
   mobilized curricula to a class, we observe one compelling mobilized
   lesson that exploits the affordances of mobile learning to provide
   multiple learning pathways for elementary grade (primary) 2 students.
   Through the lesson, students move beyond classroom activities that
   merely mimic what the teacher says and does in the classroom, and yet
   they still learn in personally meaningful ways. In deconstructing the
   lesson, we provide an in-depth analysis of how the affordances of
   mobile computing enable personalized learning from four facets: (a)
   allowing multiple entry points and learning pathways, (b) supporting
   multi-modality, (c) enabling student improvisation in situ, and (d)
   supporting the sharing and creation of student artifacts on the move. A
   key property of mobile technology that enables these affordances lies
   with the small form factor and the lightweightness of these devices
   which make them non-obtrusive in the learning spaces of the student.
   This article makes a contribution on the design aspects of mobilized
   lessons, namely, what the affordances of mobile technologies can
   enable. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It is difficult to examine the effectiveness of technology-based
   courses (TBC) without understanding the design and application in
   classrooms. There is evidence of disconnects among the theory for
   designing, the theory used to apply TBCs in classrooms, and the theory
   used to research and evaluate TBCs [Hickey, D. T. (1997). Motivation
   and contemporary socio-constructivist instructional perspectives.
   Educational Psychologist, 32(3), 175-193]. Comments provided by
   administrators, teachers and students may lead researchers to determine
   whether or not the original TBC course goals have been attained. In
   this paper, we first discuss examples of theoretical disconnects found
   in other technology-based research [Aleven, V. E., Stahl, E., Schworm,
   S., Fischer, F., & Wallace, R. (2003). Help seeking and help design in
   interactive learning environments. Review of Educational Research,
   73(3), 277-320; Hickey, D. T., & McCaslin, M. (2001). A comparative,
   sociocultural analysis of context and motivation. In S. Volet, & S.
   Jarvela (Eds.), Motivation in learning contexts: Theoretical advances
   and methodological implications (pp. 33-55). Elmsford, NY: Pergamon
   Press]. Then, we describe the course design of the mathematics TBC used
   in this study, the reasons the principal and the teacher's believe the
   software will benefit their mathematics students, and the perceptions
   of mathematics students regarding the effectiveness of the technology
   in their classroom. In conclusion, we will discuss how this preliminary
   qualitative data shaped our future research questions. (C) 2009

AB Collaboration becomes an essential competency in the current knowledge
   society. In this study, a collaborative learning environment was
   designed to facilitate students in group collaboration. Instructional
   support strategies of friendship and meaningful learning tasks were
   applied to promote collaboration. Scaffolding strategies such as
   writing progress reports and developing product versions were used to
   coordinate and monitor the collaborative learning environment. in
   addition, the online file sharing tool DriveHQ was used to facilitate
   collaboration. Four classes of students used the learning environment
   to complete their final project in pairs. Results showed friendship and
   meaningful learning tasks helped to promote individual accountability
   and positive interdependence, and the use of progress reports and
   product versions was useful for coordinating and monitoring the
   learning process. However, additional strategies might be needed for
   more effective collaboration to take place. Issues involved in this
   study are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Collaborative learning environments provide a set of tools for students
   acting in groups to interact and accomplish an assigned task. In this
   kind of systems, students are free to express and communicate with each
   other, which usually lead to collaboration and communication problems
   that may require the intervention of a teacher. In this article, we
   introduce an intelligent agent approach to assist teachers through
   monitoring participations made by students within a collaborative
   distance learning environment, detecting conflictive situations in
   which a teacher's intervention may be necessary. High precision rates
   achieved on conflict detection scenarios suggest great potential for
   the application of the proposed rule-based approach for providing
   personalized assistance to teachers during the development of group
   works. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article described the experiences of an inservice professional
   development program for teachers with a focus on online synchronous
   discussions. Transcripts of six online synchronous discussions
   containing 3600 messages from an online teacher professional
   development course were analyzed. In addition, the researchers
   interviewed 10 participating teachers in order to understand their
   perceptions toward online synchronous discussions. According to the
   online discourse data, the online synchronous discussions served not
   only as a learning tool, but also an avenue for teachers to request and
   provide information, socialize and support each other. The analyses
   also revealed that the teachers posted more social messages in the
   beginning and the end of discussion, and most messages did not involve
   any cognitive and metacognitive skills. Moreover, the interview results
   showed that the information exchange during online synchronous
   discussion was not effective for some participating teachers. Based on
   the interview data, synchronous discussions appeared to hold little
   advantage when compared to face-to-face discussions for several
   participating teachers that we interviewed. The problem may be resulted
   from lack of self-regulated skills by the participants or from the role
   played by the moderator. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The myriad of information communication technologies (ICTs) available
   today has changed the way students choose and use them. Specifically,
   individuals are increasingly relying on a mix of ICTs for communication
   to accomplish tasks. Yet, past studies on ICT use has largely assumed
   that people use a single ICT per task. We attempt to address this gap
   by focusing on the influence of individual differences on the choice of
   communication portfolio (a mix of ICTs) to accomplish learning tasks in
   school-based settings. Specifically, we focus on two dimensions of
   individual differences: learning styles and individuals' perceptions.
   Results suggest that individual differences do have effects on the
   choice of communication portfolios to accomplish tasks. In particular,
   we found that students who preferred to learn by hearing tended to
   choose the complex communication portfolio to accomplish their tasks.
   Interestingly, our results also indicate that students preferred to use
   the simple communication portfolio when communication partners were
   perceived to be unavailable. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Based on self-determination theory, this study proposes an extended
   information systems continuance theory in the context of teachers'
   utilization of e-learning technology in connection with on-site
   courses. In the proposed model teachers' extrinsic motivation (i.e.
   perceived usefulness), confirmation of pre-acceptance expectations and
   intrinsic motivation are predicted to be influenced by perceived
   autonomy, perceived competence and perceived relatedness. Even though
   information systems continuance theory has received quite extensive
   attention in prior research, this study is among the first to examine
   the effects of self-determination theory constructs in the context of
   teachers' utilization of e-learning technology. The results show that
   extension of IS-continuance theory with constructs that represent
   users' basic psychological needs and intrinsic motivation can be useful
   for predicting their e-learning continuance intentions. (C) 2009

AB This study attempts to implement a cooperative reading environment for
   EFL early reading using a mobile-device-supported computer-assisted
   reciprocal early English reading (CAREER) system, and to evaluate its
   effect on the early reading skills and learning behaviors of elementary
   EFL learners. The design rationale of CAREER is based on the three
   essential components of effective reading instructions: balanced
   reading structure, immediate and specific feedback, and reciprocal
   learning scenario. Analytical results indicate that the CAREER system
   reduces the problems experienced by students in a conventional
   cooperative learning environment and effectively helps elementary EFL
   learners orchestrate their learning while completing individual reading
   tasks and pursuing group goals. The results also demonstrate that
   CAREER appears to be able to benefit elementary EFL learners in
   developing reading skills. In sum, with the support of CAREER, the
   early reading skills of elementary students are benefited by
   cooperating with each other. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB No school is an island; it is a part of a continuum or a pipeline of
   institutions which together form an educational pipeline through which
   groups of students pass. To turn a body of data into useful information
   for knowledge-based decision-making at any level, data must be
   collected, organised, analysed and reflected upon. The purpose of this
   paper is to discuss how schools and other educational institutions can
   not only collect better data but learn how to transform that data so
   that the information held within can be effectively shared among all
   stakeholders. This process will help to ensure that the school and the
   entire education system provide a more seamless and effective
   educational pipeline for students, and ultimately improve the quality
   of education delivered in the country as a whole. (C) 2009 Elsevier

AB This paper presents the IPS-1-model: a model that describes the process
   of information problem solving (IPS) in which the Internet (1) is used
   to search information. The IPS-1-model is based on three studies, in
   which students in secondary and (post) higher education were asked to
   solve information problems, while thinking aloud. In-depth analyses of
   the thinking-aloud protocols revealed that the IPS-process consists of
   five constituent skills: (a) defining information problem, (b)
   searching information, (c) scanning information, (d) processing
   information, and (e) organizing and presenting information. Further,
   the studies revealed that regulation skills prove to be crucial for the
   on-going IPS-process. The IPS-1-model depicts the constituent skills,
   regulation skills, and important conditional skills. The model gives an
   initial impetus for designing IPS-instruction. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper the influence of the learning context is considered when
   learning to program. For the purposes of this study, the lectures,
   study process, previous knowledge or teaching experience and tests
   comprised the learning context. The article argues that students'
   experiences of the learning context have important implications for
   teaching and learning. Therefore, the solutions that most students work
   towards in order to solve a problem are an indication of an essential
   aspect: the learning context. The study attempts to understand the
   influence that the learning context has on pre- and in-service teachers
   learning to program. The participants who took a course in Java
   programming were asked to keep a journal, which indicated their
   reflections throughout the course. These reflections together with
   interview transcripts of some participants were used in the analysis.
   The instructors of the course were also part of this qualitative study.
   Activity theory was used as a basis for the analysis. It was found that
   both the problem and the learning context have a profound effect on
   students' understanding and performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Our research explores a virtual reality application based on Web camera
   (Webcam) input-interface. The interface can replace with the mouse to
   control direction intention of a user by the method of frame
   difference. We divide a frame into nine grids from Webcam and make use
   of the background registration to compute the moving object. In order
   to make this technology apply to 3D virtual reality system, we use the
   Virtools Dev to build virtual scenes and the Microsoft Visual C++ to
   build this interface. We also use the MySQL database management system
   to access users' data and the displaying data. We implement a number of
   Building Blocks (BB) to support Virtools Dev for using the database
   management system and the Webcam input-interface in this composite
   system. The results of research are expected to the digital content
   industries such that users can easy to use the input-interface to
   control browsing the virtual reality. Our system can supply interactive
   digital content, photographs, and access the questions from the
   database management system. In addition, the system provides the
   browsing mold, the question mold. and the course content describing
   mold with the input-interface. In order to explore the intention of
   users for using the system, we design the questionnaire based on the
   technology acceptance model (TAM). In our empirical study, we find that
   perceived playfulness is positive association with attitude toward
   using. Interface style is positive association with perceived ease of
   use. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined business students' perceptions of four objectives
   (i.e., Enjoyment, Learning, Motivation, and Career Application) across
   five teaching technologies (i.e., Projector, PowerPoint, Video, the
   Internet, and Lecture), business professors' effective application of
   technologies, and students' academic performance. We collected data
   from 215 students at a regional state university in the USA. We
   developed Students' Perceptions of Technology Scale, SPOTS,
   specifically for the present study, used the most rigorous criteria,
   and investigated reliability, convergent and discriminant validity,
   exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and measurement
   invariance of this scale. Mean scores revealed that Video conveyed the
   highest amount of Enjoyment. PowerPoint provided the highest amount of
   Learning and Motivation. The Internet provided the highest Career
   Application for future jobs. Younger students preferred Video, whereas
   older students favored Lecture. Regression results showed that the use
   of Video for Learning, Projector and Lecture for Enjoyment, PowerPoint
   for career and Motivation, and the Internet for Learning contributed to
   professors' teaching effectiveness. Students' high ratings for
   professors' effective use of the Lecture method and low expectation for
   the use of a Projector predicted their self-reported GPA (academic
   performance). Professors may use a different mix of technologies in the
   classroom and use them creatively in order to promote the most Learning
   for students and satisfy students' Learning needs and objectives. (C)

AB Within the framework of research that describes the processes of
   collaborative knowledge construction in computer-supported
   collaborative learning (CSCL) environments, the present work has three
   objectives: (i) the identification of the strategies of six small
   groups of university students for the elaboration of written products
   in a CSCL environment: (ii) seek relations between the identified
   writing strategies and the processes and phases of collaborative
   knowledge construction in the groups; and (iii) relate these strategies
   and phases with the learning results obtained by the groups. We carried
   out a multiple-case study, with the analysis of four different didactic
   sequences, in two different virtual learning and teaching settings. In
   each setting, three student groups were studied, where each had to
   collaboratively develop between four and eight written products. For
   all the studied groups, the analysis enabled the identification of five
   types of strategies in the preparation of the elaboration of written
   products, and four types of phases of collaborative knowledge
   construction, which are interrelated and also connected with the grades
   that the groups obtained in each case. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Academic conferences are places of situated learning dedicated to the
   exchange of knowledge. Knowledge is exchanged between colleagues who
   are looking to enhance their future research by taking part in several
   formal and informal settings (lectures, discussions and social events).
   We studied the processes of knowledge sharing and the influence of the
   use of IT at the International Conference of Information Systems
   (ICIS2007) held in Montreal. We describe the categories of knowledge
   content shared at the conference. Two forms of knowledge sharing were
   analyzed: formal, guided, planned knowledge sharing in lectures or
   discussions, and informal knowledge exchange during social events. Data
   were collected from 274 participants at the conference. The intensity
   of knowledge sharing in the formal settings was higher compared to the
   informal settings and was perceived as contributing to future research
   and to the creation of social relationships. In contrast, informal
   knowledge sharing contributed mainly to job enhancement and to the
   initiation of meetings. The discussion centers on planning and
   evaluating conferences in terms of seeking, creating and sustaining
   knowledge sharing. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many educators distribute either complete or incomplete handouts so
   students can follow along with their lectures. This research examines a
   teaching system that combines computer-generated graphics presentations
   and detailed outline handouts with blanks added, An experiment found
   that this system produced significantly higher short-term recall of a
   presentation when compared with note-taking on lined paper and with no
   note-taking. Visual design variables, specifically slide typefaces and
   type, were also manipulated to examine whether they had independent
   effects on short-term recall or influenced the benefits from
   note-taking. No significant main effects or interactions were found for
   the visual aid variables. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   suggesting a multi-dimensional approach for LMS evaluation via six
   dimensions: (1) system quality, (2) service quality, (3) content
   quality, (4) learner perspective, (5) instructor attitudes, and (6)
   supportive issues. A survey instrument based on HELAM has been
   developed and applied to 84 learners. This sample consists of students
   at both undergraduate and graduate levels who are users of a web-based
   learning management system, U-Link, at Brunei University. UK The survey
   instrument has been tested for content validity, reliability, and
   criterion-based predictive validity. The analytical results strongly
   support the appropriateness of the proposed model in evaluating LMSs
   through learners' satisfaction. The explanatory factor analysis showed
   that each of the six dimensions of the proposed model had a significant
   effect on the learners' perceived satisfaction. Findings of this
   research will be valuable for both academics and practitioners of
   e-learning systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined how middle school students constructed their
   understanding of the mitosis and meiosis processes at a molecular level
   through multimedia learning materials presented in different
   interaction and sensory modality modes. A two (interaction modes:
   animation/simulation) by two (sensory modality modes:
   narration/on-screen text) factorial design was employed. The dependent
   variables included subjects' pre-test, post-test, and retention-test
   scores, showing their understanding of mitosis and meiosis process at
   molecular level, as well as data of subjects' eye-movement behavior.
   Results showed the group that received animation with narration
   allocated a greater amount of visual attention (number of fixations,
   total inspection time, and mean fixation duration) than the group that
   received animation with on-screen text, in both pictorial area and area
   of interest, which is consistent with students' immediate and long-term
   retained learning of the processes of mitosis and meiosis. The group
   that received simulation with on-screen text allocated a greater amount
   of visual attention than the group that received simulation with
   narration, consistent with students' immediate and retained learning.
   The group that received simulation with on-screen text also allocated a
   greater amount of visual attention than the group that received
   animation with on-screen text, consistent with students' immediate and
   retained learning. This study adds empirical evidence of a direct
   correlation between the length of eye fixation behavior and the depth
   of learning. Moreover, it provides insight into the multimedia effect
   on students' cognitive process through the use of eye fixation behavior
   evidence. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Educational hypertexts usually include graphical overviews, conveying
   the structure of the text schematically with the aim of fostering
   comprehension. Despite the claims about their relevance, there is
   currently no consensus on the impact that hypertext overviews have on
   the reader's comprehension. In the present paper we have explored how
   hypertext overviews might affect comprehension with regard to (a) the
   time at which students read the overview and (b) the hypertext
   difficulty. The results from two eye-tracking studies revealed that
   reading a graphical overview at the beginning of the hypertext is
   related to an improvement in the participant's comprehension of quite
   difficult hypertexts, whereas reading an overview at the end of the
   hypertext is linked to a decrease in the student's comprehension of
   easier hypertexts. These findings are interpreted in light of the
   Assimilation Theory and the Active Processing model. Finally, the key
   educational and hypertext design implications of the results are
   discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One of the most significant changes in the field of education in this
   information age is the paradigm shift from teacher-centered to
   learner-centered education. Along with this paradigm shift,
   understanding of students' e-learning adoption behavior among various
   countries is urgently needed. South Korea's dense student population
   and high educational standards made investment in e-learning very
   cost-effective. However, despite the fact that South Korea is one of
   the fastest growing countries in e-learning, not much of the research
   results have been known to the globalized world. By investigating
   critical factors on e-learning adoption in South Korea, our study
   attempts to fill a gap in the individual country-level e-learning
   research.
   Based on the extensive literature review on flow theory, service
   quality, and the Technology Acceptance Model, our study proposes a
   research model which consists of four independent variables (instructor
   characteristics, teaching materials, design of learning contents, and
   playfulness), two belief variables (perceived usefulness and perceived
   ease of use), and one dependent variable (intention to use e-learning).
   Results of regression analyses are presented. Managerial implications
   of the findings and future research directions are also discussed. (C)

AB Drawing on the experience of development and use of a virtual learning
   environment (VLE) at a public Mexican university, this article explores
   the tension between the most common definitions and attributes of
   learning object (LO) in the mainstream literature, and the teacher's
   practices around the creation and incorporation of LOs in the VLE. This
   experience shows that attempting to define LOs from strictly technical
   or industrial parameters might be limiting in the context of
   educational institutions, since teachers are developing and using LOs
   effectively. despite their little adherence to prescriptive
   definitions. Yet it is important to support teachers in order to take
   advantage of the interactive and multimedia potentialities afforded by
   this technology, instead of using it mostly for delivering static
   content. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the
   educational environment supported by computer aided presentations at
   primary school. The effectiveness of the environment has been evaluated
   in terms of students' learning and remembering what they have learnt.
   In the study, we have compared experimental group and control group in
   terms of learning and recalling what has been learned regarding the
   effect which computer aided learning environment imposes. Data have
   been collected through the control grouped pretest-final test model.
   During the experiment, we have prepared an achievement test, which
   explains behaviors the students should acquire. According to the
   findings obtained, a computer aided educational environment has been
   observed to be more effective than that of conventional education in
   terms of learning. However, in terms of the permanence of what has been
   learned, no meaningful difference between the educational environment
   supported by computer aided presentations and that of conventional
   education has come out. According to the results of the follow-up tests
   performed, even though students in the test group have forgotten more
   of what they have learnt, it has been concluded that students in both
   groups have forgotten on the same level. Consequently, it has been
   observed that though the educational environment supported by computer
   aided presentations has positive contributions to learning activity, it
   does not have effects on the permanence of what has been learnt. (C)

ID PERFORMANCE; PROGRAMS; STUDENTS; SUCCESS; CLIMATE; WHITE; RACE
AB Blacks, Hispanics/Latinos, and Native Americans have long been
   underrepresented in schools and the workplace in science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics. Although the monitoring of representation
   has become a larger and more important enterprise, existing databases
   make it difficult to discern trends in participation at different
   stages of science education as well as the magnitude of the differences
   in representation across racial/ethnic groups. We reanalyze four
   nationally representative databases to call attention to the
   difficulties, and we offer it solution-a ratio of representation. Our
   investigation of the representation Of Students in the biological
   sciences indicates that gains in the percentages of non-Asian
   minorities in the biological sciences over almost two decades do not
   exceed their growth in the U.S. population and, furthermore, that their
   Underrepresentation appears to increase as they move through higher
   education. We call for the development of multiple measures of
   representation in the sciences, given the complexities of representing
   representation and the issue's importance for science, public health,
   and the American polity. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed

TI Conceptions of Knowledge in Research on Students' Understanding of the
   Greenhouse Effect: Methodological Positions and Their Consequences for
   Representations of Knowing
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID DISCOURSE
AB Much of the research on students' understanding of the greenhouse
   effect and global warming reports poor results. Students are claimed to
   hold misconceptions and naive beliefs, and the impact of teaching on
   their conceptions is also low. In the present study, these results are
   called into question, and it is argued that they may to a large extent
   be seen as artifacts of the research methods deployed, in particular
   when written questionnaires are used. When following students' project
   work in school over a long period, many of the misunderstandings
   reported in the literature do not appear. It is argued that the
   appropriation and use of scientific language when discussing complex
   socioscientific issues is a gradual process. When observing the
   language and mediational means students use over time, it is obvious
   that they are able to identify and use central distinctions in their
   interactions. They are also able to make productive use of texts and
   other materials that allow them to successively approximate scientific
   modes of reasoning. Thus, what students know emerges in communicative
   practices where they interact with others and with cultural tools in a
   focused activity. It is argued that students' knowledge of complex
   multidisciplinary phenomena of this kind may be particularly ill-suited
   to conventional questionnaire types of testing. (C) 2009 Wiley

AB The first years of teaching can be demanding, as the novice works to
   gain familiarity with many aspects of professional work. Often, what
   they have been prepared to do in teacher education programs is not
   aligned with what is expected at them in schools. As a consequence,
   many teachers leave the profession or move away from the reform-minded
   practice emphasized in their preparation as they accept the norms of
   their new community of practice. Using cultural historical activity
   theory, this comparative case study explored two beginning science
   teachers' transition into the teaching profession and the roles a
   community of practice played in this transition. Findings suggest that
   these science teachers were influenced by the social and professional
   structures at their schools and by the level of institutional and
   interpersonal support they received from peer teachers and
   administrators. The extent to which these teachers became involved in
   the community of practices at their schools greatly influenced their
   instructional practice. Implications suggest that science teacher
   preparation and induction programs must go beyond simply emphasizing
   teaching and learning-they must also address strategies young teachers
   can use to access the support they need to be able to consistently
   enact reform-based practices. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed

AB Students' difficulties with learning science have generally been framed
   in terms of their generalized conceptual knowledge of a science topic
   as elicited through their explanations of natural phenomena. In this
   paper, we empirically explore what more goes into giving a scientific
   account of a natural phenomenon than giving such generalized
   explanations. We audio-recorded pairs of upper secondary students
   during laboratory work in electrochemistry. We used a situative and
   pragmatist approach to study learning in action. This approach made it
   possible to study how the particulars and contingencies of working with
   a real electrochemical cell went into students' reasoning. Our results
   show that Students needed to learn to make distinctions, recognize, and
   name the particulars in encounters with their cell. They also needed to
   learn what counts as reasonable readings and to deal with quantitative
   issues and correlations pertaining to their cell. We refer to these
   additional learning requirements as the students' taxonomic and
   measurement interests. Implications for what is involved in giving a
   scientific account of a natural phenomenon in school are discussed. The
   Study constitutes an attempt to include, in a systematic way, also the
   particulars and contingencies of actual practice in an account of
   students' reasoning in science. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed

ID CURRICULUM; STUDENTS; EDUCATION; REFORM; IMPACT
AB Previous literature has documented how teachers perceive both
   advantages and disadvantages associated with standards-based reform.
   These teacher perceptions may be connected to classroom practices in
   terms of the extent to which standards are utilized by individual
   teachers. The purpose of this study was to identify how secondary
   science teachers characterize state science standards, modify their
   curricula on the basis of standards, and view the impacts of standards
   on students and teachers in their schools. Twenty-two science teachers
   from five purposefully selected school districts were interviewed using
   a protocol targeting attitudes toward standards and accountability,
   ways teachers use standards to develop and modify curricula, impacts of
   standards on students and teachers, and utilization of standards-based
   resources and professional development. An inductive approach was used
   to analyze data and produced both common views of science standards
   held by many teachers and profiles that characterize subgroups of
   teachers. Participants described both positive and negative aspects of
   standards-based accountability, and roughly half of the teachers
   described modifying their curricula according to standards. Teachers
   were categorized into six different profiles: negative perspectives,
   game of testing, already doing it, part of the cycle, reality of
   teaching, and useful tools. Suggestions for different approaches to
   professional development are elaborated for teachers of these various
   profiles. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 93:1050-1075, 2009

TI The Link Between Policy and Practice in Science Education: The Role of
   Research
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID TIMSS; CHEMISTRY
AB Policy has been a much neglected area for research in science
   education. In their neglect of policy studies, researchers have
   maintained an ongoing naivete about the politics of science education.
   In doing so, they often overestimate the implications of their research
   findings about practice and ignore the interplay between the
   stakeholders beyond and in-school who determine the nature of the
   curriculum for science education and its enacted character. Policies
   for education (and science education in particular) always involve
   authority and values, both of which raise sets of fascinating questions
   for research. The location of authority for science education differs
   across educational systems in ways that affect the role teachers are
   expected to play. Policies very often value some groups in society over
   others, as the long history of attempts to provide science for all
   students testifies. As research on teaching/learning science identifies
   pedagogics that have widespread effectiveness, the policy issue of
   mandating these becomes important. Illustrations of successful policy
   to practice suggest that establishing conditions that will facilitate
   the intended implementation is critically important. The responsibility
   of researchers for critiquing and establishing policy for improving the
   practice of science education is discussed, together with the role
   research associations could play if they are to claim their place as
   key stakeholders in science education. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This article reports on a research study investigating the career
   decision-making processes of urban science teachers as one element
   central to understanding the high rates of attrition in the field.
   Using a longitudinal, prospective, context- and subject-specific
   approach, this study followed the career decisions of case study
   teachers over a period of 12 months. All eight of the case study
   teachers envisioned themselves eventually moving Out of classroom
   teaching positions. Each used an ongoing and active process of decision
   making to evaluate their professional direction and sought confirmation
   of their contribution to the field before moving into new roles and
   responsibilities. This article describes the experiences of several
   teachers who exemplify these decision-making processes. These cases
   suggest potential benefits for differentiated roles, professional
   mentoring, and recognition and feedback from professional communities.

AB Despite considerable focus on evolution knowledge-belief relationships,
   little research has targeted populations with strong content
   backgrounds, such as undergraduate degrees in biology. This study (1)
   measured precertified biology and non-biology teachers' (n = 167)
   knowledge of evolution and the nature of science; (2) quantified
   teacher preferences for the teaching of creationism in schools; (3)
   examined the associations among knowledge and belief variables; and (4)
   contrasted the knowledge and beliefs of prospective biology teachers
   with those of non-biology teachers. Methodologically, teacher knowledge
   was quantified by using three measures and studied in relation to
   certification area, self-reported religiosity, personal conflict
   concerning science and religion, and completion of an evolution course.
   We found (1) generally low levels of knowledge of evolution and the
   nature of science-and high misconception magnitudes-in both biology and
   non-biology teachers; (2) comparable antievolutionary positions in
   biology and non-biology teachers: nearly half of the teachers in both
   groups advocated for the inclusion of creationism in school; (3) weak
   association between knowledge and preference/belief variables; and (4)
   no difference in preference for teaching creationism between those
   teachers who had taken an evolution course and those who had not.
   Overall, biology and non-biology teachers were found to display "mixed"
   and "novice naturalistic" evolutionary reasoning patterns. (C) 2009

AB Despite their successful use in many conscientious studies involving
   outdoor learning applications, mobile learning systems still have
   certain limitations. For instance, because students cannot obtain
   real-time, context-aware content in outdoor locations such as
   historical sites, endangered animal habitats, and geological
   landscapes, they are unable to search, collect, share, and edit
   information by using information technology. To address such concerns,
   this work proposes an environment of ubiquitous learning with
   educational resources (EULER) based on radio frequency identification
   (RFID), augmented reality (AR), the Internet, ubiquitous computing,
   embedded systems, and database technologies. EULER helps teachers
   deliver lessons on site and cultivate student competency in adopting
   information technology to improve learning. To evaluate its
   effectiveness, we used the proposed EULER for natural science learning
   at the Guandu Nature Park in Taiwan. The participants were elementary
   school teachers and students. The analytical results revealed that the
   proposed EULER improves student learning. Moreover, the largely
   positive feedback from a post-study survey confirms the effectiveness
   of EULER in supporting outdoor learning and its ability to attract the
   interest of students.

AB This article reports on a comprehensive study, investigating the use of
   e-tools for formative assignment assessment. The study conducted a
   large-scale literature review and interviews with 90 academics at five
   New Zealand tertiary institutions. The focus of the study was on
   formative assessment provided in assignments, an area in which
   educational theories on importance for learning and on best practice
   are well established. Yet, research shows that these theories have
   failed to influence tertiary practice sufficiently to ensure the best
   possible outcomes for student learning. The interview data collected
   were analysed according to motivation, needs and benefits as perceived
   by lecturers and educational principles as derived from the literature.
   Both the literature and the interview analysis showed a strong positive
   impact from using e-tools for the management and marking of
   assignments. Widely available e-learning and general purpose computer
   tools can be used effectively to support lecturers in dealing with
   assignments. Specialised assignment tools provide opportunities for
   even greater gains. The use of e-tools means time savings for the
   lecturers and enables quality gains in the assignment process. E-tools
   have the potential to assist with uptake of the well-established
   educational theories. This article summarises important aspects of the
   literature review and the interview analysis conducted as part of the
   study. It provides recommendations in the form of suggestions on which
   tools are suitable for specific steps in the assignment process and
   alerts the reader to the website where there are user profiles
   supported by case studies and an action plan. All these recommendations
   are targeted at encouraging and enabling lecturers to employ e-tools
   for the management and marking of assignments.

DE Test-sheet composition; Computer-assisted testing; Particle swarm

ID MULTIPLE ASSESSMENT CRITERIA; ALLOCATION; ALGORITHM; SYSTEM
AB For large-scale tests, such as certification tests or entrance
   examinations, the composed test sheets must meet multiple assessment
   criteria. Furthermore, to fairly compare the knowledge levels of the
   persons who receive tests at different times owing to the insufficiency
   of available examination halls or the occurrence of certain unexpected
   situations, a set of parallel test sheets needs to be composed, which
   is almost impossible to accomplish manually. To cope with this problem,
   an enhanced particle swarm optimization approach is proposed to
   efficiently compose parallel test sheets from very large item banks,
   while simultaneously meeting multiple assessment criteria. Moreover, a
   computer-assisted testing system was developed, and a series of
   experiments were performed to evaluate the comparative performance of
   the proposed approach and a genetic algorithm counterpart.

   Theoretical framework for online dropout
ID DISTANCE EDUCATION; STUDENT ATTRITION; COURSES; PROGRESS; MODEL
AB The number of adult learners who participate in online learning has
   rapidly grown in the last two decades due to online learning's many
   advantages. In spite of the growth, the high dropout rate in online
   learning has been of concern to many higher education institutions and
   organizations. The purpose of this study was to determine whether
   persistent learners and dropouts are different in individual
   characteristics (i.e., age, gender, and educational level), external
   factors (i.e., family and organizational supports), and internal
   factors (i.e., satisfaction and relevance as sub-dimensions of
   motivation). Quantitative data were collected from 147 learners who had
   dropped out of or finished one of the online courses offered from a
   large Midwestern university. Dropouts and persistent learners showed
   statistical differences in perceptions of family and organizational
   support, and satisfaction and relevance. It was also shown that the
   theoretical framework, which includes family support, organizational
   support, satisfaction, and relevance in addition to individual
   characteristics, is able to predict learners' decision to drop out or
   persist. Organizational support and relevance were shown to be
   particularly predictive. The results imply that lower dropout rates can
   be achieved if online program developers or instructors find ways to
   enhance the relevance of the course. It also implies that adult
   learners need to be supported by their organizations in order for them
   to finish online courses that they register for.

   group on post- and retention-Atomic Achievement Test and Atomic
   Dependent Reasoning Test scores, and retention-Scientific Reasoning
   Test scores. Moreover, students with a higher level of scientific
   reasoning significantly performed better than students with a lower
   level of scientific reasoning, regardless of their scores on post- and
   retention-Atomic Achievement Test and Atomic Dependent Reasoning Test.
   This study successfully demonstrates that the experimental group
   students outperformed the conventional group students in the domains of
   concept construction, conceptual change and scientific reasoning.
   Moreover, students with a higher level of scientific reasoning were
   more able to successfully change their alternative conceptions.

AB This study explored e-learning problems and solutions reported by 223
   students with disabilities, 58 campus disability service providers, 28
   professors, and 33 e-learning professionals from Canadian colleges and
   universities. All four groups indicated, via online questionnaires,
   problems with: accessibility of websites and course/learning management
   systems (CMS); accessibility of digital audio and video; inflexible
   time limits built into online exams; PowerPoint/data projection during
   lectures; course materials in PDF, and lack of needed adaptive
   technologies. Students also mentioned technical difficulties using
   e-learning and connecting to websites and CMS, problems downloading and
   opening files, web pages that would not load, video clips taking too
   long to download, poor use of e-learning by professors and their own
   lack of knowledge working with e-learning. Disability service
   providers, too, mentioned the poor use of e-learning by professors as
   well as poor accessibility of course notes and materials in many
   formats. E-learning professionals noted difficulties with inaccessible
   course notes and materials. Professors identified mainly problems
   raised by the other groups. Sixty-seven percent of students, 53% of
   service providers, 36% of e-learning professionals and 35% of
   professors indicated that at least one of their three e-learning
   problems remained unresolved. We discuss how the different roles and
   perspectives of the four participant groups influence their views, and
   make recommendations addressing identified common e-learning problems.

AB The excessive workload generated by the assessment of exam papers in
   large classes and the need to give feedback in time often constitute a
   rather heavy burden for teachers. The online peer assessment can
   contribute to reduce this workload and, possibly, to improve learning
   quality by assigning the assessment task to students. However, this
   raises the question of validity. In order to study this question, we
   carried out an experiment of online peer assessment in which 242
   students, enrolled in 3 different courses, took part. The results show
   that peer assessment is equivalent to the assessment carried out by the
   professor in the case of exams requesting simple calculations, some
   mathematical reasoning, short algorithms, and short texts referring to
   the exact science field (computer science and electrical engineering).

AB This study examined the relationship between students working in a
   technology-rich environment and their development of higher order
   thinking skills. Based on a PhD thesis, which examined a greater range
   of relationships than can be reported here, this article focuses on
   developing critical thinking skills within a technology-rich
   environment. Staff and students from one school participated in the
   study. Data were collected to determine the degree of correlation
   between factors of the learning environment and the extent to which
   critical thinking skills were demonstrated by the students. Statistical
   correlations allowed relationships between environmental factors and
   critical thinking to be established. The results indicate that there
   are statistically significant correlations between studying within a
   technology-rich learning environment and the development of students'
   critical thinking skills. Length of time spent in the environment has a
   positive, non-linear effect on the development of critical thinking
   skills. Students with better developed computing skills scored higher
   on critical thinking activities. This was most significant for students
   with better computer programming skills and the ability to competently
   manipulate Boolean logic. The research suggests that to develop
   students' higher order thinking skills, schools should integrate
   technology across all of the learning areas. This will allow students
   to apply technology to the attainment of higher levels of cognition
   within specific contexts. This will need to be paralleled by providing
   students the opportunity to develop appropriate computer skills.

   investigated the effect of these variables and their mediating
   mechanisms influencing students' learning within a blended learning
   environment. This study examined the influence of instructional and
   learner variables on learning outcomes for a blended instruction course
   offered for undergraduate students. Data analysis indicated that age,
   prior experiences with distance learning opportunities, preference in
   delivery format, and average study time are those learner antecedents
   differentiating learning outcomes among groups of college students.
   From a regression analysis, the influence of learner, instructional,
   and motivational variables on learning outcomes found to be
   consolidated around one variable in learning application.

AB The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of how
   technology has been used to enhance or replace field experiences in
   preservice teacher preparation programs, and discuss the benefits and
   limitations of traditional and technology-enhanced/virtual field
   experience approaches. In this paper, three types of
   technology-enhanced field experiences are discussed: Type I - concrete,
   direct experience in reality; Type II vicarious, indirect experience
   with reality; and Type III - abstract, experience with model of
   reality. Five specific benefits of technology use in field experiences
   are identified, namely a) exposure to various teaching/learning
   environments, b) creation of shared experiences, c) promoting
   reflectivity, d) preparing students cognitively, and e) learning about
   technology integration. Several limitations of technology-integrated
   field experiences are also discussed, including (a) lack of interaction
   with teachers and students, (b) limited reality and complexity, (c)
   availability of relevant cases, and (d) technical problems. In
   conclusion, it is suggested that the overall goals and objectives for a
   specific field experience must be the focus when field experience
   options are being explored.

AB In this paper, we go beyond what have been described as 'mechanistic'
   accounts of e-learning to explore the complexity of relationships
   between people and technology as encountered in cases of networked
   learning. We introduce from the social informatics literature the
   concept of sociotechnical interaction networks which focus on the
   interplay between participants, technology, learning artefacts and
   practices. We apply this concept to case material drawn from
   transnational trade union education to identify and to analyse three
   aspects of networked learning: the local sociotechnical networks of
   learners; the construction of an overarching, global sociotechnical
   network for learning; and the evolution of such networks over time.
   Finally we identify issues for further research highlighted by these
   models.

ID PEER MEDIATION; TEACHERS; PROGRAM
AB Cognition, faculty related to perception, imagination, memory, and
   problem solving, refers to internal mental processes through which
   sensorial input is acquired, elaborated, used, and stored. One of its
   importances relies on the fact that it affects in a direct way the
   learning potential. It has been shown that, even thou cognitive
   processes develop side by side with biological maturity, this cognitive
   development can be enhanced by means of mediated learning as signaled
   by Feuerstein's Mediated Learning theory. Based on this theory is that
   we propose an intervention model that addresses school academic issues
   using technologically assisted small group collaboration, pursuing a
   dual academic objective: to thrive students' cognitive processes while
   addressing school curriculum topics. The purpose, therefore, is to
   balance the students' cognitive differences by means of in-school
   content-filled classroom activities. Our aim is to make use of peer
   mediation in a real world setting with a virtual construction of it. In
   this paper, we describe this novel intervention model along with an
   in-school usage experience. For this, we present an activity designed
   for high school students, specifically aimed to assist the learning of
   kinematics, graph interpretation, and graph plotting. In this activity
   the students work in groups of three, using a robot and wirelessly
   interconnected Personal Digital Assistants (PDA). By means of a
   controlled experiment, we show how technologically-supported peer
   mediation promotes the students' enrichment of their cognitive
   processes in each of the different stages of the mental act
   (input-elaboration-output), favoring communication skills, insight, and
   reasoning, while also restraining impulsive conduct and trial-and-error
   answers.

AB The main purpose of this study is not to compare online and traditional
   face-to-face instruction merely to prove which one is better, but
   rather it aims to highlight some of the possible risks and strengths
   which may help to improve the role of teachers in both methods. The
   scene consisted of various thematic blocks from a training programme,
   with teachers who taught two different groups of students, one of them
   face-to-face and the other online. The study was designed using a
   quantitative and qualitative methodological combination, and focuses on
   the dimensions of "theoretical content", "practical content",
   "tutor/student interaction" and "design" of the training activity. As a
   general conclusion, no important differences were observed in the
   functions of the teacher in the two teaching methods, face-to-face and
   online; any differences that might exist were usually a consequence of
   teacher involvement and of the commitment of the institution in
   programming the learning process.

AB This study has three major purposes, including designing mobile
   natural-science learning activities that rest on the 5E Learning Cycle,
   examining the effects of these learning activities on students'
   performances of learning aquatic plants, and exploring students'
   perceptions toward these learning activities. A case-study method is
   utilized and the science club with 46 fourth-grade students is selected
   as the study case in the study. Besides, a set of quantitative and
   qualitative data were collected from the case to document the learning
   effects of and the students' perceptions of the learning activities,
   and to discuss factors underlying these effects and students'
   perceptions. The results indicate that the learning activities can
   enhance students' scientific performances, including both knowledge and
   understanding levels. Students' perceptions of these learning
   activities appear to be positive. The study identifies two factors that
   are prominent in the positive effects: students' engaging in
   "mobile-technology supported" observation during their scientific
   inquiry; and students' engaging in "mobile-technology supported"
   manipulation during their scientific inquiry. Finally, the conclusions
   that our study has drawn could constitute a useful guide for
   educational practitioners concerned with the potentials of mobile
   computing in school settings.

TI Integration and Deployment of Educational Games in e-Learning

AB Game-based learning is becoming popular in the academic discussion of
   Learning Technologies. However, even though the educational potential
   of games has been thoroughly discussed in the literature, the
   integration of the games into educational processes and how to
   efficiently deliver the games to the students are still open questions.
   This paper addresses the aspects of integration and automatic
   deployment of educational games in Learning Management Systems. This
   integration simplifies the introduction of games in educational
   settings, leveraging the pre-existing technological infrastructure. Our
   approach is based on the automatic packaging and exportation of games
   as self-contained Learning Objects that can be easily distributed
   through any LMS compliant with the current interoperability standards.
   We thus inherit the advantages of the Learning Object model in terms of
   interoperability and, when supported by the LMS, in terms of student
   tracking and assessment.

AB This study examines the influence of instructional design and
   management style on student achievement and satisfaction in a web-based
   distance learning environment. From the literature review, two major
   instructional design and management styles in web-based distance
   education were conceptualized as structure and interpersonal
   interaction. To investigate the differences on learning output
   variables, two web-based instructional programs were developed as
   college level courses. One course was developed and implemented mainly
   with a resource-based highly structured self-learning mode with little
   interpersonal interaction, and the other course was developed and
   conducted mainly with interpersonal interaction without well-structured
   materials. Sixty seven and fifty six juniors were enrolled in each
   course at a cyber university for one semester. Questionnaires,
   achievement scores, satisfaction levels, and interview data were
   collected and analyzed. Findings indicated that self-learning with
   well-structured materials was not inferior to highly interactive
   instruction without well-structured materials in receptive learning
   achievement. This implicates that well-structured material can possibly
   replace a teacher's one to one interaction in receptive learning as
   early distance educators expected. However, students in the interactive
   course without well-structured materials, rather than in the
   well-structured course with little interaction, showed higher
   achievement in critical thinking learning. In terms of satisfaction,
   students in the structured course were more satisfied with structure,
   and students in the interactive course were more satisfied with
   interpersonal interaction. Implications of these findings and
   recommendations for further study are suggested.

   Problems: Need, Difficulties and Functions
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
LA English

DE Applets; Mathematical problems; Preservice teachers; Perceptions;
   Activity theory
AB This research describes preservice teachers' perceptions of the use of
   applets in solving mathematical problems. It examines such perceptions
   regarding the role and functions that applets have in the problem
   solving context, the difficulties they encounter when using applets in
   this context and the necessity or need of their use. I attempt to
   categorize the perceived need in terms of the types of solution that
   were used by the participants and the difficulties that they met during
   solving mathematical problems. To analyze the participants' solutions,
   their difficulties and need for applets I use the content analysis
   method which enables to determine the presence of certain words or
   concepts within the text and the relation between these words or
   concepts. To discuss the participants' perception of the need for
   applets I used the activity theory frame which enables to analyze the
   participants' opinions by looking at their operations, actions and
   activity, and, at the same time, looking at their goals and motives.
   Though most of the participants thought that mathematical problems
   could be solved without applets, they emphasized the role of applets as
   fostering, facilitating and clarifying mathematical problems' statement
   and solution. The participants pointed at applets as tools which
   learners enjoy working with, so they will be encouraged to solve
   mathematical problems using them. What influenced the participants'
   perception of the need to use applets for solving mathematical problems
   were their ability to solve problems using them, their ability to solve
   problems without them and the type of difficulties faced by them during
   the solving process.

AB The purpose of the study is to compare problem based learning (PBL) and
   lecture-based learning (LBL) in Hong Kong secondary students' science
   achievement. Secondary One students were divided into two groups: group
   A (n = 37), was taught two topics: "Human Reproduction" and "Density"
   through PBL; group B (n = 38) was taught the same topics by LBL.
   Multiple choice questions and short structured response items were used
   to assess students' academic performance. Pre and post tests were
   categorized into three domains: knowledge, comprehension and
   application according to Bloom's Taxonomy (Bloom 1956). The results of
   this study suggest first that PBL is at least as effective as LBL in
   gaining the knowledge required to achieve the syllabus' learning
   objectives; secondly, the PBL group shows a significant improvement in
   students' comprehension and application of knowledge over an extended
   time. Seemingly, PBL is favored for knowledge retention compared to a
   more conventional teaching approach, by these early adolescent children
   in Hong Kong. An ongoing longitudinal study on students' interactions
   will further determine whether students taught through PBL develop
   improved learning in relation to high order skills, in a local
   situation which still tends to focus on factual recall but where higher
   skills are being demanded by systemic reform.

AB Evolution is an important and sometimes controversial component of high
   school biology. In this study, we used a mixed methods approach to
   explore students' evolution acceptance and views of evolution teaching
   and learning. Students explained their acceptance and rejection of
   evolution in terms of evidence and conflicts with religion and
   authority. Students largely supported the teaching of evolution and
   offered several reasons for its inclusion in high school biology.
   Students also offered several suggestions for improving evolution
   instruction. Evolution acceptors' and rejecters' views of evolution
   teaching and learning differed in a number of respects, and these
   differences may be explained using border crossing as a theoretical

TI Australian Secondary Students' Views About Global Warming: Beliefs
   About Actions, and Willingness to Act
SO RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Global warming; Environmental education; Secondary students' beliefs;
   Secondary students' actions
AB A 44-item questionnaire was constructed to determine secondary
   students' views about how useful various specific actions might be at
   reducing global warming, their willingness to undertake the various
   actions, and the extent to which these two might be linked. Responses
   (n = 500) were obtained from students in years 7 to 10 in three schools
   in NSW, Australia. For some pro-environmental actions, the degree to
   which students professed a willingness to act was greater than might be
   expected from the extent to which they believed the action to be
   useful. Such actions are those that involve minimal inconvenience such
   as switching off un-used electrical appliances, or those that are
   becoming well embedded in social practice, such as recycling. For other
   pro-environmental actions, the degree to which students were willing to
   act seemed less than might be expected, given the extent to which they
   believed the action to be useful. Actions concerning personal
   transport, such as buying smaller cars or using public rather than
   private transport, and obtaining more electricity from nuclear power
   stations, fell into this category. Here, there are disincentives to
   acting in a pro-environmental manner relating to personal
   inconvenience, or concern about nuclear power. The data were also
   explored to determine the strength of the relationships, for each
   action, between students' professed willingness to act and their belief
   that an action would be effective. This suggested a measure of the
   potential effectiveness of education about that action. For some
   actions, this relationship was weak; in such cases, altering belief
   about the usefulness of the action might not be expected to produce
   major changes in behaviour. Issues concerning public transport were of
   this type; clearly, for issues such as these, other approaches and/or
   inducements may be needed to persuade people to adopt pro-environmental
   behaviour patterns. For other actions the relationship was stronger, so
   that in these areas environmental education could well be effective,
   especially if a large proportion of the population are not already
   willing to undertake that action.

AB In science education students should come to understand the nature and
   significance of models. A promising strategy to achieve this goal is
   using authentic modelling practices as contexts for meaningful learning
   of models and modelling. An authentic practice is defined as
   professionals working with common motives and purposes, pertaining to a
   similar type of procedure and applying relevant knowledge on the
   modelling issue they work on. In this study we evaluate whether the use
   of authentic practices initiates adequate students' involvement. This
   was done by investigating students' interests, ownership, familiarity
   and complexity. In addition, we evaluated students' expressed modelling
   procedures in response to the modelling issues. We designed learning
   tasks which were enacted by a focus group of students. Three primary
   data sources were used to collect data. Firstly, a group discussion was
   organised in which students' reflected on both authentic practices.
   Secondly, students filled in written questionnaires containing items on
   affective and cognitive aspects. Thirdly, the realised modelling
   procedures by students were analysed. The results show that students'
   involvement was successfully initiated, evidenced by motivated
   students, willingness to continue and the completeness and quality of
   the realised modelling procedures. The design of the learning tasks
   proved to be successful in realising this involvement. The results
   obtained in this study support the strategy of using authentic
   modelling practices as contexts for meaningful learning of models and
   modelling.

AB The findings reported in this paper report on an investigation of
   Chinese people's understanding of the nature of science in relation to
   their conceptualisations of Nature. As an exploratory and interpretive
   study, it uses semi-structured interviews with 25 Chinese secondary
   school science teachers. The paper first presents these teachers'
   conceptualisations of Nature, which were mainly scientifically informed
   and showed a mixed influence of both traditional and modern Chinese
   ideas about Nature. Teachers' functional understandings of the nature
   of science were then inferred from their conceptualisations of Nature
   and presented from three perspectives: that of science; the strategies
   and approaches to doing science; and, the status of scientific
   knowledge.

AB Providing learners with opportunities to engage in activities similar
   to those carried out by scientists was addressed in a web-based
   research simulation in genetics developed for high school biology
   students. The research simulation enables learners to apply their
   genetics knowledge while giving them an opportunity to participate in
   an authentic genetics study using bioinformatics tools. The main
   purpose of the study outlined here is to examine how learning using
   this research simulation influences students' understanding of
   genetics, and how students' approaches to learning using the simulation
   influence their learning outcomes. Using both quantitative and
   qualitative procedures, we were able to show that while learning using
   the simulation students expanded their understanding of the
   relationships between molecular mechanisms and phenotype, and refined
   their understanding of certain genetic concepts. Two types of learners,
   research-oriented and task-oriented, were identified on the basis of
   the differences in the ways they seized opportunities to recognize the
   research practices, which in turn influenced their learning outcomes.
   The research-oriented learners expanded their genetics knowledge more
   than the task-oriented learners. The learning approach taken by the
   research-oriented learners enabled them to recognize the epistemology
   that underlies authentic genetic research, while the task-oriented
   learners referred to the research simulation as a set of simple
   procedural tasks. Thus, task-oriented learners should be encouraged by
   their teachers to cope with the scientists' steps, while learning
   genetics through the simulation in a class setting.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB The present study takes an interdisciplinary mathematics-physics
   approach to the acquisition of the concept of angle by children in
   Grades 3-5. This paper first presents the theoretical framework we
   developed, then we analyse the concept of angle and the difficulties
   pupils have with it. Finally, we report three experimental
   physics-based teaching sequences tested in three classrooms. We showed
   that at the end of each teaching sequence the pupils had a good grasp
   of the concept of angle, they had truly appropriated the physics
   knowledge at play, and many pupils are enable to successfully grasp new
   physics situations in which the angle plays a highly meaningful role.
   Using a physics framework to introduce angles in problem situations is
   then pertinent: by interrelating different spaces, pupils were able to
   acquire skills in the domains of mathematics, physics, and modelling.
   In conclusion, we discuss the respective merits of each problem
   situation proposed.

ID CONCEPT-MAPPING TECHNIQUES; STUDENTS; SCIENCE; RELIABILITY; CLASSROOM;
   MOMENTUM; VALIDITY; SCORES; LAWS
AB Concept mapping is a technique that paves the way to represent
   knowledge schematically. In this research, concept mapping was used as
   an assessment method on the impulse-momentum topic. The purpose of this
   study was to determine teacher candidates' knowledge about
   understanding of the concepts of impulse and momentum by comparing and
   contrasting two different methods; namely, students' concept maps and
   an achievement test. The mean of teacher candidates' concept map scores
   are extremely low when compared with the scores of the achievement
   test. In addition, it was seen that although a great number of concepts
   were written down, not many relationships were established between
   these concepts. There is a weak correlation between the achievement
   test and the concept map scores since concept maps assess the students'
   knowledge from a conceptual perspective while the achievement tests
   measure the level of students' knowledge on the topic and his/her
   ability to apply this knowledge on different occasions.

TI Secondary Students' Thinking about Familiar Phenomena: Learners'
   explanations from a curriculum context where 'particles' is a key idea
   for organising teaching and learning
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CHEMICAL-CHANGE; GAS STATE; PART 1; CHEMISTRY; CONCEPTIONS; MOLECULES;
   ATOMS; SUBSTANCES; SCIENCE
AB Particle models of matter are widely recognised as being of fundamental
   importance in many branches of modern science, and particle ideas are
   commonly introduced and developed in the secondary school curriculum.
   However, research undertaken in a range of national contexts has
   identified significant learning difficulties in this topic, and
   suggests that notions of particles that match scientific models are
   generally only attained over periods of some years. The implementation
   of a National Curriculum in Science in England was followed by
   increasingly prescriptive guidance to teachers. This culminated in a
   framework for teaching lower secondary science, which identified
   'particles' as one of five key ideas for organising teaching and
   learning of science to all 11 14-year-olds. In this curriculum context,
   a basic particle model is introduced at the start of secondary
   education, and consolidated by being revisited in various contexts over
   three years. However, National Tests suggest that only a minority of
   pupils attain levels of understanding matching target knowledge. The
   present paper reports an interview study that explored how a sample of
   English secondary students explained phenomena commonly met in school
   science. It was found that students generally used the notion of
   particles, although most of their particle-based explanations reflected
   alternative conceptions that have been reported in previous research.
   It is concluded that a curriculum strategy of early introduction and
   regular application during the early secondary years is not of itself
   sufficient to support the desired progression in thinking with particle
   models, and more sophisticated research-informed pedagogy is needed.

DT Article
ID ILLNESS; VIEWS
AB The present paper describes a study in which 13 children aged 9-11
   years, of diverse ethnic, linguistic, and socio-economic backgrounds,
   were asked to use a digital camera and small notebook to document the
   range of things they consider to be healthy and unhealthy. Using
   open-ended interview questions, the children were then asked to explain
   each item, including what it was, why they chose it, and why they
   thought it was either healthy or unhealthy. The range of definitions of
   'healthy' and 'unhealthy' invoked by the children was surprisingly
   broad, encompassing not only illness and proper nutrition, but also
   environmental health, mental health, cleanliness, and other meanings.
   Findings across all 13 children are displayed, and a case study of one
   child serves as a detailed example of the types of meanings children
   ascribe to the words 'healthy' and 'unhealthy', as well as the kinds of
   analyses being employed on these data. The theoretical implications of
   these results for research on children's ideas about health, as well as
   implications for the design of health interventions, are discussed.

TI Would You Want to Talk to a Scientist at a Party? High school students'
   attitudes to school science and to science
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Attitudes; Science; Survey; High school students
ID CURRICULUM; VIEWS; GIRLS; BOYS
AB The present paper describes a four-year project involving the
   development of a new instrument, the Attitudes to School Science and
   Science instrument, and its use to collect baseline attitudinal data
   from 280 students aged 11, 14, and 16 years. A key feature of the
   instrument is that it collects both descriptive and explanatory data in
   a pencil-and-paper format. The data gathered are probed in detail for
   explanatory insights into features that have emerged from more recent
   research on attitudes to science, in particular the suggestions that
   students view science outside school more positively than their
   experiences in science lessons, and that the early years of secondary
   education (ages approximately 11-14 years) are the most crucial in
   shaping attitudes. The study shows that positive attitudes to school
   science decline significantly between the ages of 11 and 14 years, with
   little appreciable downward change beyond this and, in some cases, a
   slight upturn. Female students display less positive attitudes and less
   clear-cut views on a variety of aspects of science. A sense of science
   being important in general terms, although not having much appeal for
   individual students, also emerged clearly from the data. The paper
   suggests that attitudinal instruments have a role to play in research,
   but that these need to be complemented by studies of detailed features
   of schools that may influence attitudes, some of which may not be
   apparent from data collected from students.

TI Pedagogic strategies supporting the use of Synchronous Audiographic
   Conferencing: A review of the literature
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID DESIGN; INFORMATION
AB Synchronous audiographic conferencing (SAC) refers to a combination of
   technologies for real-time communication and interaction using multiple
   media and modes. With an increasing institutional uptake of SAC, users
   require an understanding of the complex interrelations of multiple
   media in learning scenarios in order to support pedagogic-driven
   planning and effective use of the tool. This paper provides a review of
   recent literature that explores the pedagogic strategies used to
   underpin practical uses of SAC for the benefit of learners especially
   in non-standard contexts such as distance education. The paper reports
   on approaches from practitioner-oriented perspectives as well as
   approaches based on educational theory, notably the community of
   inquiry model, task design and multimodal models of cognition, meaning
   and interaction. The main features of these models were extracted to
   provide both a synthesis for future work on dedicated pedagogic models
   for SAC and a resource for practitioners wanting to link SAC with
   educational theory.

ID INVOLVEMENT; EXPERIENCES; ATTITUDES; STUDENTS; BELIEFS
AB In the context of hybrid instruction, this study was designed to
   explore whether gender has an influence on learners' preferences for
   synchronous or asynchronous modes of computer-mediated communication,
   and whether this decision impacts learners' self-efficacy (SE) towards
   knowledge acquisition. The participants were 180 teacher-education
   students (151 females and 29 males) enrolled in a hybrid (blend of
   traditional classroom instruction and online learning activities)
   foundations course at a United States research university with a
   proportionally high percentage of full-time commuters and/or distance
   enrolees. The findings showed that, regardless of gender, two-thirds of
   the participants preferred asynchronous modes over synchronous ones. In
   addition, gender was weakly related to the participants' SE in both
   modes. Linear regression indicated that SE, in turn, was weakly related
   to academic performance. The implications of these findings for
   instructional practice are discussed.

TI eCAF: A new tool for the conversational analysis of electronic
   communication
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION; ONLINE
AB Electronic communication is characteristically concerned with 'the
   message' (eM), those who send them (S), and those who receive and read
   them (R). This relationship could be simplified into the equation eM =
   S + R. When this simple equation is applied to electronic
   communication, several elements are added that make this
   straightforward act of sending and receiving a message more complex.
   These new elements are characteristics such as asynchronicity, unknown
   senders and readers, non-linear text and the absence of non-verbal
   cues. What is apparent is that the complexity of these messages lies in
   their impact outside the online environment. It is clear from the
   messages themselves that the information is being applied to real,
   authentic contexts and is not limited to the online environment.
   Conversational analysis frameworks must attempt to understand this
   complexity if the meaning of electronic messages is to be understood.
   This paper proposes a new conversational analysis framework, the
   electronic conversational analysis framework (eCAF), for use with
   electronic communication. The eCAF has been designed as a new
   methodological tool that incorporates the unique virtual/real worlds
   that individuals participate in and links these two locations to the
   phases of electronic discussions.

TI Ontology-based concept map for planning a personalised learning path
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ITEM RESPONSE THEORY; ENVIRONMENT; SYSTEM
AB Developing personalised web-based learning systems has been an
   important research issue in e-learning because no fixed learning
   pathway will be appropriate for all learners. However, most current
   web-based learning platforms with personalised curriculum sequencing
   tend to emphasise the learner preferences and interests in relation to
   personalised learning services but fail to consider the difficulty
   level of course materials, learning order of prior and posterior
   knowledge and learner abilities while constructing a personalised
   learning path. As a result, these ignored factors thus easily lead to
   the generation of poor quality learning paths. Generally, learners
   could generate cognitive overload or fall into cognitive disorientation
   owing to inappropriate curriculum sequencing during learning processes,
   thus, reducing the learning effect. With the advancement of artificial
   intelligence technologies, ontology technologies enable a linguistic
   infrastructure to represent conceptual relationships between course
   materials. Ontology can be served as a structured knowledge
   representation scheme, capable of assisting the construction of a
   personalised learning path. This study thus proposes a novel
   genetic-based curriculum sequencing scheme based on a generated
   ontology-based concept map, which can be automatically constructed by
   the pretest results of numerous learners, to plan appropriate learning
   paths for individual learners. The experimental results indicated that
   the proposed approach could create high-quality learning paths for
   individual learners. The proposed approach thus can help learners to
   learn more effectively and to likely reduce learners' cognitive
   overloads during learning processes.

TI Understanding learner acceptance of learning objects: The roles of
   learning object characteristics and individual differences
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

ID WORLD-WIDE-WEB; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; SELF-EFFICACY; MODEL; TECHNOLOGY;
   EXTENSION; SUCCESS; USAGE
AB Many organisations and institutions have integrated learning objects
   into their e-learning systems to make the instructional resources more
   efficient. Like any other information systems, this trend has made user
   acceptance of learning objects an increasingly critical issue as a high
   level of learner satisfaction and acceptance reflects that the users
   are more willing to continue to use the technology. In this study, an
   extended version of technology acceptance model (TAM) with two external
   variables (learning object characteristics and individual differences)
   was developed to investigate the underlying factors and causal
   relationships in predicting learners' acceptance of learning objects.
   This study called for the respondents to progress through two phases of
   learning object participation: introduction and direct-use experience
   to investigate the students' perceptions in terms of usefulness and
   ease of use while utilising learning objects. The findings show that
   both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are determinants of
   behavioural intention to use learning objects. Learning object
   characteristics influence both perceived usefulness and perceived ease
   of use of learning objects; individual differences appear to have no
   influence upon intention to use learning objects.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
ID TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION
AB This literature review explores the historical development of
   information and communication technology (ICT) in Irish
   postprimary/secondary schools and examines how the education system has
   responded to the various ICT initiatives and policy changes. The review
   has found that despite national policy and significant ICT initiatives,
   it appears that the use of computer technology has instead evolved
   independent of these changes. The various policy nudges throughout the
   past three decades have had limited impact on the nature of its use.
   The predominant use of the technology lies within discrete informatics
   subjects which tend to focus on learning about the technology rather
   than learning with it. Future ICT policy needs to be cognisant of the
   past, particularly how national ICT initiatives are mediated within
   schools and the powerful influence of the prevailing ICT culture on
   external ICT initiatives.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
ID PEER-ASSESSMENT; ANONYMITY
AB This study focuses on mitigating evaluation apprehension, which is
   usually unavoidable in identifiable social situations, via the
   constructive use of prominent features of networked technologies.
   Specifically, this study investigated learners' attitudes towards
   different user-identity revelation modes, namely, real-identity,
   anonymity and created-identity, in an online question-construction and
   peer-assessment context. Forty university freshmen, taking a physics
   laboratory course, participated for one semester in 2007. A learning
   system called The Question Authoring and Reasoning Knowledge System
   which allowed students to contribute and benefit from cyclic process of
   constructing and reviewing questions, was devised. Analysis of the data
   gathered found that students reacted statistically differently to the
   modes of real name, anonymity and nickname. Furthermore, participating
   students adjusted their preferred mode in different roles and
   circumstances. The data obtained suggest that program developers should
   embed flexible and versatile capabilities of computer and communication
   technologies by allowing individuals the opportunity not to be
   identified or only be identified via a nickname of their choice, so as
   to help eliminate feelings of embarrassment and uneasiness, which are
   not psychologically sound and may hinder the learning process.

TI Making training more cognitively effective: Making videos interactive
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID BENEFITS
AB The cost of health and safety (H&S) failures to the UK industry is
   currently estimated at up to 6.5 pound billion per annum, with the
   construction sector suffering unacceptably high levels of work-related
   incidents. Better H&S education across all skill levels in the industry
   is seen as an integral part of any solution. Traditional lecture-based
   courses often fail to recreate the dynamic realities of managing H&S on
   site and therefore do not sufficiently create deeper cognitive learning
   (which results in remembering and using what was learned). The use of
   videos is a move forward, but passively observing a video is not
   cognitively engaging and challenging, and therefore learning is not as
   effective as it can be. This paper describes the development of an
   interactive video in which learners take an active role. While
   observing the video, they are required to engage, participate, respond
   and be actively involved. The potential for this approach to be used in
   conjunction with more traditional approaches to H&S was explored using
   a group of 2nd-year undergraduate civil engineering students. The
   formative results suggested that the learning experience could be
   enhanced using interactive videos. Nevertheless, most of the learners
   believed that a blended approach would be most effective.

AB This article presents an analysis of how students' dispositions toward
   learning shift and change over time through their engagement with
   particular classroom practices and identifies classroom practices that
   support the development of more productive dispositions. An analysis of
   4 purposefully selected students from 2 different classrooms reveals
   that membership in a classroom activity system does not determine one's
   emergent disposition toward learning. However, it is likely that
   similar types of dispositions might emerge within a single classroom
   activity system. The analysis further seeks to understand the
   mechanisms that underlie the ways in which dispositions are enacted in
   moments of interaction, and how aspects of classroom practice impact
   this enactment. The findings support the argument that social,
   affective, and motivational factors are not simply influences on
   learning but are, instead, central to and inseparable from the learning
   process.

ID AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDENTS
AB The purpose of this 2-part study was to explore the mathematical and
   purchasing competencies present in students' engagement in shopping
   practices in a low-income African American neighborhood. Study 1
   consisted of in situ analyses of children's shopping activities at a
   local store, revealing the variety of arithmetic tasks that emerged in
   relation to varied artifacts, shopping routines, social norms, and
   clerk support. In an effort to reveal competencies that could not be
   measured through observation alone, Study 2 consisted of individual
   interviews of 30 first and second graders about tasks that required
   them to purchase items at a mock store. Analyses revealed both
   strategies that were frequently and infrequently associated with
   successful purchasing and the relationship between children's strategy
   choices and the demands of particular purchases. This research
   documents the many mathematical competencies children present that may
   not be captured in traditional school assessments and considers how
   this prior knowledge might be used to inform instruction and treatments
   of sociocultural frameworks.

AB We investigated how 2 different curricular scaffolds (context-specific
   vs. generic), teacher instructional practices, and the interaction
   between these 2 types of support influenced students' learning of
   science content and their ability to write scientific arguments to
   explain phenomena. The context-specific scaffolds provided students
   with hints about the task and what content knowledge to use in or
   incorporate into their writing. The generic scaffolds supported
   students in understanding a general framework (i.e., claim, evidence,
   and reasoning) regardless of the content area or task. This study
   focused on an 8-week middle school chemistry curriculum that was
   enacted by 6 teachers with 578 students during the 2004-2005 school
   year. Analyses of identical pre- and posttests as well as videotapes of
   teacher enactments revealed that the curricular scaffolds and teacher
   instructional practices were synergistic in that the effect of the
   written curricular scaffolds depended on the teacher's enactment of the
   curriculum. The context-specific curricular scaffolds were more
   successful in supporting students in writing scientific arguments to
   explain phenomena, but only when teachers' enactments provided explicit
   domain-general support for the claim, evidence, and reasoning
   framework, suggesting the importance of both types of support in
   successful learning environments.

AB This article introduces the essential features of the science component
   of 2006 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA).
   Administered every 3 years, PISA alternates emphasis on Reading,
   Mathematics, and Science Literacy. In 2006, PISA emphasized science.
   This article discusses PISA's definition of scientific literacy, the
   three competencies that constitute scientific literacy, the contexts
   used for assessment units and items, the role of scientific knowledge,
   and the importance placed on attitude toward science. PISA 2006
   included a student test, a student questionnaire, and a questionnaire
   for school administrators. The student test employed a balanced
   incomplete block design involving thirteen 30-minute clusters of items,
   including nine science clusters. The 13 clusters were arranged into
   thirteen 2-hour booklets and each sampled student was assigned one
   booklet at random. Mean literacy scores are presented for all
   participating countries, and the percentages of OECD students at the
   six levels of proficiency are given for the combined scale and for the
   competency scales. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 46:

ID CURRICULUM
AB The PISA assessment instruments for students' scientific literacy in
   2000, 2003, and 2006 have each consisted of units made up of a real
   world context involving Science and Technology, about which students
   are asked a number of cognitive and affective questions. This article
   discusses a number of issues from this use of S&T contexts in PISA and
   the implications they have for the current renewed interest in
   context-based science education. Suitably chosen contexts can engage
   both boys and girls. Secondary analyses of the students' responses
   using the contextual sets of items as the unit of analysis provides new
   information about the levels of performance in PISA 2006 Science.
   Embedding affective items in the achievement test did not lead to
   gender/context interactions of significance, and context interactions
   were less than competency ones. A number of implications for
   context-based science teaching and learning are outlined and the PISA
   2006 Science test is suggested as a model for its assessment. (C) 2009

TI Performance and Levels of Contextualization in a Selection of OECD

SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING
LA English
DT Article
DE context; scientific literacy
AB Correct responses to the unitized items of PISA 2006 rely to differing
   extents on the contextual stimulus supplied. This difference is
   referred to in this study as the degree of contextualization. A
   selection of science items from PISA 2006 has been assigned to two
   categories, not by competencies as in the framework for the PISA
   survey, but by the degree to which the item requires the ability to
   extract and apply information from the contextual stimulus provided.
   The article explores how Students in Germany and in other selected OECD
   countries perform in solving these two types of items. The results show
   that German students' performance is satisfactory when solving items
   which require knowledge to be recalled and applied but that they are
   also quite capable of extracting and using information from the item
   stimuli. Somewhat different distributions are observed in other
   selected OECD countries. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci

AB In this article, we explore the Programme for International Student
   Assessment (PISA) with a lens informed by the socioscientific issues
   (SSI) movement. We consider the PISA definition of scientific literacy
   and how it is situated with respect to broader discussions of the aims
   of science education. We also present an overview of the SSI framework
   that has emerged in the science education community as a guide for
   research and practice. We then use this framework to support analysis
   of the PISA approach to assessment. The PISA and SSI approaches are
   seemingly well aligned when considering general aims. Both approaches
   emphasize preparing students for life and citizenship, complex
   reasoning and reflective practices, and robust understandings of the
   nature of science particularly as it is practiced in society. However,
   as the focus of comparison moves from the conceptual to more specific,
   the connections between PISA and the SSI movement become more tenuous.
   For instance, many of the PISA test items, at least those that have
   been released publicly., seem quite removed from the intent of the SSI
   movement. The article concludes with a discussion of recent trends in
   research associated with SSI, which may provide alternative avenues for
   assessing progressive aims of science education. (C) 2009 Wiley

AB Finnish students' opinions about the frequency of learning activities
   and communication in the Finnish science classroom, their interest in
   science and science studies and careers, their sense of self-efficacy,
   and their beliefs about their own competence as well as their
   performance in science are analyzed based on PISA 2006 Scientific
   Literacy Assessment data. Students' success on PISA is explained by
   these context variables and by the national education policy in
   Finland. The regression analysis revealed that positive student level
   predictors for PISA science performance were science-related
   self-efficacy and self-concept, interest in physics and chemistry, and
   a view of the usefulness of science studies in preparing Students for
   future jobs in science. From the point of view of science teaching, one
   of the most robust predictors of the high results in Finland were
   frequent use of teacher demonstrations, practical work in the
   classroom, and the possibility for students to draw conclusions.
   Knowledge based society, educational equality, and devolution of
   decision power at the local level, and teacher education are named as
   most important educational policy issues behind students' high
   performance in PISA 2006 science. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

ID SCIENTIFIC LITERACY; VIEWS
AB The framework developed for the PISA 2006 science survey starts from
   everyday contexts in which citizens encounter scientific issues and
   knowledge claims. Recent curriculum changes in England, making possible
   the introduction of courses for 15- to 16-year olds with an explicit
   "scientific literacy" emphasis, are based on a very similar analysis,
   identifying knowledge about science itself as a key element of
   knowledge, alongside scientific knowledge of the natural world. The
   pilot trials and implementation of such courses provide an unrivalled
   opportunity to study the nature and extent of the challenge facing
   policymakers, curriculum developers, and teachers in re-focusing
   secondary science on the learning needs of the citizen. This article
   examines the extent to which teachers recognized and were able in their
   practice to implement teaching of "ideas about science" (IaS), by
   looking at teachers' views and practices during the pilot trials of the
   Twenty First Century Science courses in England. Using classroom
   observations and teacher interviews, the practice in 8 schools was
   followed in depth over two years, supplemented by questionnaire survey
   to all 78 schools piloting Twenty First Century Science. Contemporary
   contexts were emphasized in the curriculum resources and welcomed by
   pupils and teachers. Teachers' perceptions and actions indicated that
   science content knowledge continued to dominate over knowledge about
   science, despite the curriculum emphasis on teaching the latter strand
   in the context of current socio-scientific issues. Dealing with
   contemporary contexts and IaS posed pedagogic problems for many
   teachers, even when professional support was available. Only after at
   least one full cycle of teaching the course had some of the teachers
   begun to modify their practice to address knowledge about science and
   contexts of application more effectively. The study suggests that
   teachers' practices can be changed, but that this takes time and
   requires considerable support from teaching materials and other forms
   of professional development that encourage reflection on practice. (C)

AB This quasi-experimental study examined 42 high school introductory
   chemistry students' conceptual understandings of the particulate nature
   of matter (PNM) before and immediately after instruction. Two groups of
   students, who were taught by the same teacher, received one of two
   possible instructional interventions: Reform-Based Teaching (RBT) or
   Reform-Based Teaching with Multiple Representations (RBTw/MR). The
   RBTw/MR instruction differed from the RBT instruction in terms of the
   frequency of using multiple representations (visual, textual, oral) in
   relationship to the macroscopic phenomenon and the likely actions
   occurring at the submicroscopic level. Qualitative research methods,
   including open-ended questionnaires and interviews, were used to
   investigate and describe participants' conceptual understandings of the
   PNM over time. The findings indicated that before instruction all
   participants held a range of alternative conceptions about the aspects
   of the PNM. Post-instruction findings indicate that the RBTw/MR
   instruction was more efficacious in promoting a scientific
   understanding of the PNM than was the instruction without multiple
   representations.

AB School Innovation in Science is a major Victorian Government initiative
   that developed and validated a model whereby schools can improve their
   science teaching and learning. The initiative was developed and rolled
   out to more than 400 schools over the period 2000-2004. A research team
   worked with 200+ primary and secondary schools over three years,
   supporting them in developing new initiatives in science, and
   monitoring the impact on school and classroom practice, and student
   outcomes. The research effort underpinning the development phase
   included the development and validation of a set of components
   describing effective teaching, the refinement of a school and teacher
   change strategy, the development of instruments to monitor teacher
   classroom practice and a variety of student outcomes, and the
   development of insights into the change process using questionnaires,
   observations, and interviews across four years. This paper describes
   the project and its major outcomes, and raises a number of issues
   concerning the nature of school and teacher change, pedagogy, school
   and community, and student learning, and the way these interact. A
   number of research issues are raised by the size and developmental
   nature of the project, the range of research methods, and the different
   audiences served by the research. The issue of sustainability of such
   system-wide change initiatives is discussed.

AB Educational researchers have suggested that the tension between the
   learner-centred and teacher-centred pedagogies represents a real
   classroom issue that influences teaching and learning. This issue may
   be particularly significant in East-Asian countries such as Taiwan due
   to some cultural influences. For example, teacher authority is highly
   valued in the culture. Accordingly, the present study aims to develop a
   questionnaire-the Teacher Authority Survey (TAS), with actual and
   preferred versions-to explore students' perceptions/preferences
   regarding teacher authority in the earth science course. The
   relationships among students' perceptions/preferences for teacher
   authority, learning attitudes, and learning achievements were
   investigated. Six hundred and seventeen Taiwanese high school students
   were administered the TAS, the earth science attitudinal questionnaire,
   and achievement assessment. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor
   analyses indicated that the TAS developed in this study has
   satisfactory validity and reliability measures. Correlation analysis
   indicated that the classrooms more oriented to learner-centredness were
   correlated with more favourable attitudes toward learning. Moreover,
   three clusters of preferred teacher authority-namely, teacher-centred
   authority, uncertain authority, and sharing authority-were identified.
   Students who preferred sharing authority tended to have more favourable

AB Science enrichment programmes housed outside traditional school
   settings can offer students from traditionally under-resourced schools
   valuable opportunities to access authentic scientific tools and
   practices. The present study contributes to our understanding of this
   potential and how it can best be realised through an analysis of the
   students' own perspectives on a specific out-of-school programme-a
   one-year partnership with a university-based science outreach
   programme, which culminated in a half-day laboratory experience for a
   total of 292 secondary students (ages 11-18 years). Extensive data were
   collected on this experience, including detailed field notes and video
   recordings of the classes' visits to the university as well as the
   planning meetings with teachers at the beginning and end of the school
   year, surveys of the participating students, and surveys and interviews
   of the teachers, and were analysed both qualitatively and
   quantitatively using a grounded theory approach. Building on the
   valuable perspectives of the participating students, and comparing them
   with those of their eight teachers, this study confirms that carefully
   designed collaborative out-of-school inquiry programmes have the
   potential to broaden students' (especially those from under-resourced
   schools) experiences of science as well as bridge them to school
   science.

AB To make meaning of scientific knowledge in such a way that concepts and
   values of the life-world are not threatened is difficult for students
   and laymen. Ethics and morals pertaining to the use of genetic tests
   for hereditary diseases have been investigated and discussed by
   educators, anthropologists, medical doctors and philosophers giving, at
   least in part, diverging results. This study investigates how students
   explain and understand their argumentation about dilemmas concerning
   gene testing for the purpose to reduce hereditary diseases. Thirteen
   students were interviewed about their views on this issue. Qualitative
   analysis was done primarily by relating students' argumentation to
   their movements between ethics and morals as opposing poles. Students
   used either objective or subjective knowledge but had difficulties to
   integrate them. They tried to negotiate ethic arguments using
   utilitarian motives and medical knowledge with sympathy or irrational
   and personal arguments. They discussed the embryo's moral status to
   decide if it was replaceable in a social group or not. The educational
   implications of the students' use of knowledge in personal arguments
   are discussed.

AB This study aimed to explore secondary students' explanations of
   evolutionary processes, and to determine how consistent these were,
   after a specific evolution instruction. In a previous study it was
   found that before instruction students provided different explanations
   for similar processes to tasks with different content. Hence, it seemed
   that the structure and the content of the task may have had an effect
   on students' explanations. The tasks given to students demanded
   evolutionary explanations, in particular explanations for the origin of
   homologies and adaptations. Based on the conclusions from the previous
   study, we developed a teaching sequence in order to overcome students'
   preconceptions, as well as to achieve conceptual change and explanatory
   coherence. Students were taught about fundamental biological concepts
   and the several levels of biological organization, as well as about the
   mechanisms of heredity and of the origin of genetic variation. Then,
   all these concepts were used to teach about evolution, by relating
   micro-concepts (e.g. genotypes) to macro-concepts (e.g. phenotypes).
   Moreover, during instruction students were brought to a conceptual
   conflict situation, where their intuitive explanations were challenged
   as emphasis was put on two concepts entirely opposed to their
   preconceptions: chance and unpredictability. From the explanations that
   students provided in the post-test it is concluded that conceptual
   change and explanatory coherence in evolution can be achieved to a
   certain degree by lower secondary school students through the suggested
   teaching sequence and the explanatory framework, which may form a basis
   for teaching further about evolution.

AB Young-earth creationism has undergone a shift in emphasis toward
   building of historical models that incorporate Biblical and scientific
   evidence and the acceptance of scientific conclusions that were
   formerly rejected. The RATE Group admitted that massive amounts of
   radioactive decay occurred during earth history but proposed a period
   of accelerated decay during Noah's Flood to fit the resulting history
   into a young-earth timeframe. Finding a mechanism for the acceleration
   and dealing with the excessive heat and radiation it would generate
   posed major problems for the project. Catastrophic plate tectonics was
   proposed to explain continental movements in a short timeframe and
   serve as a trigger for Noah's Flood, but other creationists rejected
   the idea citing hopeless chronological problems. Creationists have also
   sought to explain the order of the fossil record and the Ice Age in a
   young-earth timeframe. An examination of these efforts demonstrates the
   anti-scientific nature of using the Bible as a non-negotiable framework
   for earth history.

AB This paper introduces a novel strategy for teaching physics: using the
   Nobel Physics Prize as an organizational theme for high school or even
   first year university physics, bringing together history, social
   contexts of science, and central themes in modern physics. The idea
   underlying the strategy is that the glamour and glitter of the Nobel
   Prize story may attract and motivate high school students to open-up to
   scientific topics and thus be spurred to pursue science. The two major
   arguments for the method are that if presented in story form Nobel
   Prizes naturally incorporate the philosophical and historical aspects
   of science and therefore enable teaching about science as well as
   teaching science itself; and that such instruction implements
   case-based teaching principles, which is how humans naturally think,
   learn, and remember. Finally, the paper presents the storycase of the
   Nobel Prize Einstein received for his discovery of the law of the
   photoelectric effect as a concrete illustration of classroom
   implementation.

ID WORK-ENERGY; ASSESSMENTS; THEOREMS
AB Researchers and practitioners alike express concerns about the
   conceptual difficulties associated with the concepts of momentum and
   kinetic energy currently taught in school physics. This article
   presents an in-depth analysis of the treatment given to them in 44
   published textbooks written for UK secondary school certificate
   courses. This is set against some of the more contentious issues
   apparent in the literature concerned with the underlying physics and
   pedagogical arguments about how best to help students understand. The
   research evolved a set of criteria which were used to scrutinize how
   texts explain ideas and exemplify their applications. Despite the
   evident merits of many textbooks, the findings suggest that incomplete
   explanations are surprisingly prevalent, with several fundamental
   issues likely to be unclear to student readers, particularly those
   relating to when and where conservation might apply. Confusion exists
   between these difficult and somewhat overlapping ideas, arguably
   through the neglect of constructivist considerations. The commonly
   emphasized mechanistic, number-crunching approach to the analysis of
   simple collision problems is judged to be un-profitable, underlining
   the more general point that prevailing, accepted content and pedagogy
   may be the source of many misunderstandings. implications are discussed
   and suggestions made for alternative treatments of these deceptively
   complex topics. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 46:

ID BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENA; STUDENTS; SCIENCE
AB The biological processes of photosynthesis and plant cellular
   respiration include multiple biochemical steps, occur simultaneously
   within plant cells, and share common molecular components. Yet,
   learners often compartmentalize functions and specialization of cell
   organelles relevant to these two processes, without considering the
   interconnections as well as the significance of the plant as an
   independent biological system functioning as a nested component within
   local and global ecosystems. Understanding connections among biological
   systems at macro and micro levels is important to biological literacy.
   This study examined preservice elementary teachers' conceptions of
   photosynthesis and plant cellular respiration, with attention to
   interconnections and systems. Participants were limited in their
   understanding of the processes impacting multiple ecological levels,
   and they held inadequate representations of interconnections between
   the processes. Participants' views were laden with sociological and
   egocentric components. They often compared plant functions with
   analogous human functions. Most participants viewed plants as dependent
   on humans while having societal use. Justifications for views included
   nominal knowledge of the processes; experiential authoritarian
   reasoning; and anthropomorphism. We discuss instructional implications
   in light of the findings. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci

AB This study presents a description and analysis of a ninth-grade
   integrated science curriculum developed and implemented by teachers
   within a high school science department and subsequently sustained for
   over 25 years. The Integrated Science Program (ISP) at Lakeside
   Southwest High School depicted here offers a unique example of
   longitudinal science education reform. In this study, we examined ISP
   as an artifact of teacher leadership. Findings affirmed the importance
   of shared philosophical purpose among teachers, attention to public
   perceptions, staff stability, the distribution of responsibilities, and
   instructional coherence. This study also demonstrated how curricular
   reforms might change over time in response to contextual pressures as
   was the case with the equity challenges faced by the current teachers
   of ISP. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 46: 813-835,

AB This study examined the effect of fidelity of implementation (FOI) on
   the science achievement gains of third grade students broadly and
   students with limited literacy in English specifically. The study was
   conducted in the context of a professional development intervention
   with elementary school teachers to promote science achievement of ELL
   students in urban schools. As the criterion for measuring FOI, we
   focused on the quality of instructional delivery in teaching science to
   ELL students. We measured FOI using both teachers' self-reports and
   classroom observations during the first year of the intervention.
   Science achievement was measured by a pretest and posttest over the
   school year. The results indicate that none of the measures of FOI
   using teachers' self-reports or classroom observations had significant
   effects on science achievement gains. The results are discussed in
   terms of issues about conceptualization and measurement of FOI in
   educational interventions. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci

AB The context of this article is the new technological environment and
   the struggle to use meaningful teaching practices in Norwegian schools.
   Students' critical reflections in two different technological learning
   environments in six upper secondary schools are compared. Three of
   these schools offer Internet-connected computers in special computer
   rooms outside ordinary classrooms, while the three other schools offer
   laptops to every student in class with a wireless connection to the
   Internet. The study relies on a quasi-experimental design. Data come
   from 719 student responses to a survey questionnaire and are analysed
   using multivariate regression. The findings are that critical
   reflection is enhanced in classrooms with laptops, controlling for
   students' motivation, self-efficacy, gender, grades and cultural
   background. On this basis, computers could have a significant potential
   for enhancing reflection and nourishing classroom discourse, knowledge
   development, and student empowerment. Motivation and self-efficacy have
   the strongest impact, while cultural capital has a minor effect on
   critical thinking. Students' grades seem to have no predictive power
   with respect to critical reflection. The results are discussed in
   relation to theories of Bildung, empowerment and democracy. Various
   implications for teaching are discussed.

AB P>In recent years, digital games have assumed an important place in the
   lives of children and adolescents. Effective content design is crucial
   to the success of digital game-based learning. Therefore, the tool for
   assessing the effectiveness of game design is accordingly very
   important for parents and teachers, so that they may encourage or
   discourage students to play. The purpose of this study is to develop an
   assessment tool to examine the educational values of digital games. In
   the first phase of this research, the research team developed the
   indices for assessing the educational values of digital games. An
   expert panel consisting of game scholars and professional game
   designers was established to construct the indices for evaluating
   digital games in three focus group discussions. Seventy-four game
   evaluation indices were sorted into seven categories: mentality change,
   emotional fulfilment, knowledge enhancement, thinking skill
   development, interpersonal skill development, spatial ability
   development and bodily coordination. In the second phase of the
   research, the game designers were asked to assess certain games by
   using the 74 indices. Meanwhile, the game scholars were also asked to
   evaluate the same pool of games by the same indices. The assessments by
   both the scholars and designers were then compared and the similarities
   were found. This research provided a preliminary framework for future
   game designers, parents and teachers in assessing educational values of
   digital games.

AB This study extends the research on asynchronous online discussion (AOD)
   by providing a perspective on: (1) the growth patterns of discussion
   threads and (2) the influence of peer- or student-facilitation
   techniques on thread development. Using the Pointing, Questioning,
   Resolving and Summarizing (PQRS) facilitation techniques framework, the
   threaded discussions of seven AOD forums were carefully mapped out and
   each message in the postings was examined to determine the type of
   facilitation techniques applied. Results suggest that an online
   discussion thread grows either one of three patterns: a 'short thread
   pattern', an 'extended thread pattern' with an elongated structure or a
   'split thread pattern' with a broad structure. Results also suggest
   that the use of Resolving and Summarizing facilitation techniques tends
   to foster early thread termination. Understanding how each PQRS
   student-facilitation technique impacts thread development reinforces
   the need to combine the use of 'questioning' techniques with other
   facilitation techniques to enhance thread continuity. We end by
   discussing some possible implications and issues for future research.

AB P>There is growing interest in the integration of technology into the
   classroom. A range of initiatives have been launched to develop
   in-service teacher training processes that will strengthen this
   integration. In the present paper, we systematize the findings of a
   large selection of studies on this topic, focusing on domains and
   competencies linked to teacher training propositions for technology
   integration. Our main result is the presentation of six such domains
   that have been proposed in the existing literature:
   instrumental/technological, pedagogical/curricular,
   didactic/methodological, evaluative/investigative,
   communicational/relational and personal/attitudinal. A set of teaching
   competencies for each domain is also identified. These domains and
   competencies together form the bases for creating a technology
   integration training model.

DE teacher change; technology in the classroom; technology integration
ID PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE
AB P>In this paper, we devise a diagrammatic conceptualization to describe
   and represent the complex interplay of a teacher's knowledge (K), goals
   (G) and beliefs (B) in leveraging technology effectively in the
   classroom. The degree of coherency between the KGB region and the
   affordances of the technology serves as an indicator of the teachers'
   developmental progression through the initiation, implementation and
   maturation phases of using technology in the classroom. In our study,
   two teachers with differing knowledge, goals and beliefs are studied as
   they integrated GroupScribbles technology in their classroom lessons
   over a period of 1 year. Our findings reveal that the transition
   between the teacher's developmental states (as indicated by coherency
   diagrams) is nonlinear, and thus the importance of ensuring high
   coherency right at the initiation stage. Support for the teacher from
   other teachers and researchers remains an important factor in
   developing the teacher's competency to leverage the technology
   successfully. The stability of the KGB region further ensures smooth
   progression of the teacher's effective integration of technology in the
   classroom.

AB This article examines several research questions to establish a theory
   model for explaining factors that influence adult learners' preferences
   for constructivist Internet-based learning environments (CILE). Data
   were gathered from 541 individual participants enrolled in adult
   education institutes in Taiwan for structural equation modelling (SEM)
   analyses. The research results established a 10-scale instrument for
   assessing adult learners' preferences for CILE. Among the scales of
   CILE, adult students placed the highest value on relevance to life and
   reflective thinking, and scored the lowest for critical judgement, ease
   of use and student negotiation. The SEM analyses revealed that compared
   to Internet self-efficacy (ISE), self-directed learning readiness plays
   a major role in predicting adults' preferences for their learning
   environment, especially for the higher level of intellectual challenge.
   ISE plays a mediating role in the relationships between Internet usage
   and the participants' preferences. This result suggests that more time
   spent on Internet practice may increase adult learners' ISE, which may
   strengthen their preferences for Internet-based learning environments.

AB This paper studies the social talk of high school students in online
   discussion forums. On-task talk has generally been assessed as valuable
   discussion because it contributes directly to productive learning.
   Off-task conversation, on the other hand, is often regarded as useless
   and a waste of time. Should this social talk indeed be regarded as an
   off-task activity? Is social talk such as greeting, excusing,
   comforting and sharing personal feelings irrelevant to learning? This
   study analyzes threads and argues that social talk is interwoven with
   on-task talk. It is interesting to note that a substantial quantity of
   off-task messages served the latent function of guiding group
   discussion toward making progress in solving collaborative problems in
   a subtle and indirect manner. The power of "soft talk" embedded in
   off-task social conversation is explored and fully discussed.

AB While the importance of viewing learning as knowledge creation is
   gradually recognized (Paavola et al. Computer-supported collaborative
   learning: foundations for a CSCL community 2002; Rev Educ Res
   74:557-576 2004), an important question remains to be answered-what
   represents an effective instructional design to support collaborative
   creative learning? This paper argues for the need to move away from
   efficiency-oriented instructional design to innovation-oriented
   instructional design if learning as knowledge creation is to be pursued
   as an important instructional goal. The rationale in support of this
   argument is discussed from four different theoretical perspectives and
   an idea-centered, principle-based design approach as an example is
   proposed for discussion.

AB This paper offers an emerging interpretive framework for understanding
   the active role instructional designers play in the transformation of
   learning systems in higher education. A 3-year study of instructional
   designers in Canadian universities revealed how, through reflexive
   critical practice, designers are active, moral, political, and
   influential in activating change at interpersonal, professional,
   institutional and societal levels. Through narrative inquiry the voices
   of designers reflect the scope of agency, community and relational
   practice in which they regularly engage with faculty in institutions of
   higher learning.

AB The purpose of this study was to identify and validate items applicable
   to evaluating online courses at the postsecondary level. Items were
   derived from a review of the literature. Four judges rated the
   similarity of the items by making pair-wise comparisons utilizing
   multidimensional scaling (MDS). The study consisted of five stages.
   Stage I involved identifying items. Stage II involved validating items.
   Stage III involved sampling. Stage IV involved developing an online MDS
   instrument accommodating the 4,851 ([99 * 98]/2) pair-wise comparisons
   and rating them. Stage V involved data collection and analysis. The
   results of the MDS study indicated a three-dimensional solution
   (Accessibility, Adaptability, and Clarity of Communication) as the
   appropriate model for analysis. The three-dimensional solution
   indicated .24222 for the fit values of STRESS and .74 for R-squared.
   Four clusters were identified as Contextual Accommodation,
   Instructional Access, Guided Learning, and Organizational Clarity.

AB Two studies analyzed impacts of writing and receiving web-mediated peer
   reviews on revision of research reports by undergraduate science
   students. After conducting toxicology experiments, 77 students posted
   draft reports and exchanged double-blind reviews. The first study
   randomly assigned students to four groups representing full, partial,
   or no peer review. Students engaging in any aspect of peer review made
   more revisions than students confined to reviewing their own reports.
   In the second study, all students engaged in peer review, and the
   influence of writing versus receiving critiques was analyzed using
   linear regression. Both studies showed receiving reviews to be more
   significant than writing them in terms of triggering report revisions.
   Students valued the peer review experience and credited it with giving
   them insights about their work. Conclusions address implications for
   optimal design of online peer review systems and for further research
   into student learning gains.

AB Numerous instructional design models have been proposed over the past
   several decades. Instead of focusing on the design process (means),
   this study investigated how learners perceived the quality of
   instruction they experienced (ends). An electronic survey instrument
   containing nine a priori scales was developed. Students responded from
   89 different undergraduate and graduate courses at multiple
   institutions (n = 140). Data analysis indicated strong correlations
   between student self-reports on academic learning time, how much they
   learned, First Principles of Instruction, their satisfaction with the
   course, perceptions of their mastery of course objectives, and global
   course ratings. Most importantly, these scales measure principles with
   which instructional developers and teachers can evaluate their products
   and courses, regardless of design processes used: provide authentic
   tasks for students to do; activate prior learning; demonstrate what is
   to be learned; provide repeated opportunities for students to
   successfully complete authentic tasks with coaching and feedback; and
   help students integrate what they have learned into their personal
   lives.

AB This pilot investigative study tested the efficacy of a music
   e-learning resource specifically constructed to enable individual
   learners to play a 12-bar improvised blues by ear, on a musical
   keyboard, in an e-learning environment. The study also sought the
   participants' perspective of this experience by eliciting their
   reflections on the learning experience. Participant perceptions of the
   role of the 'on-line tutor' in this e-learning environment were also
   examined. The research adopted a qualitative approach through
   video-taped observation of the participants as they engaged with the
   resource. The resulting video data was analysed employing an inductive
   process of analysis. Semistructured interviews were also conducted with
   individual participants after the learning sessions were completed.
   Qualitative analysis of the interview transcriptions provided the
   participant perspective. Triangulation between the data validated
   researcher interpretations of the findings. Results revealed (a) all
   participants successfully engaged with the musical task in the
   e-learning environment, (b) five learning activities emerged from the
   analysis of the video data that were interpreted as: 'instruction',
   'copying', 'practising', 'playing' and 'evaluating', (c) four
   'participant perspective' themes emerged from the interview data that
   were interpreted as: 'activities', 'feelings', 'evaluation' and
   'difficulties' (d) participants sought different levels of interaction
   with the on-line tutor' who was found to adopt the role of 'remote
   facilitator'. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have created a
   supportive environment for collaborative learning at the expense of
   student motivation and engagement. This study attempts to explore the
   development of a productive learning atmosphere in the context of
   Web-based learning. An experiment is conducted with university-level
   students having homogenous background and coursework by applying
   heterogeneous pedagogies that create either competitive or
   collaborative learning atmospheres. The differences in learning
   atmosphere bring about variations in social presence and enjoyment of
   learning. The findings show that "coopetition" (defined as
   collaboration within the group and competition between groups) was the
   best learning strategy because competition and collaboration stimulated
   different types of knowledge growth in the knowledge-creation spiral.
   Competitive learning atmospheres encourage Students to develop higher
   analytic skills, while collaborative learning atmospheres prompt
   students to demonstrate higher synthetic skills. Because both
   atmospheres contribute to learning, this study has found that combining
   both pedagogies in constructing a coopetitive learning atmosphere not
   only contributes to analytic and synthetic skills, but also raises the
   overall knowledge level. The findings pinpointed the importance of
   creating a learning environment that integrates ICTs. learners'
   backgrounds, courseware, and pedagogic considerations in the process of
   increasing knowledge levels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID STUDENTS; SCHOOL
AB This paper develops personalized models for different university
   degrees to obtain the risk of each student abandoning his degree and
   analyzes the profile for undergraduates that abandon the degree. In
   this study three faculties located in Granada, South of Spain, were
   involved. In Software Engineering three university degrees with 10,844
   students, in humanities nineteen university degrees with 39,241
   students and in Economic Sciences five university degrees with 25,745
   students were considered. Data, corresponding to the period 1992
   onwards, are used to obtain a model of logistic regression for each
   faculty which represents them satisfactorily. These models and the
   framework data show that certain variables appear repeatedly in the
   explanation of the drop out in all of the faculties. These variables
   are, among others, start age, the father's and mother's studies,
   academic performance, success, average mark in the degree and the
   access form and in some cases also, the number of rounds needed to
   pass. Students with weak educational strategies and without persistence
   to achieve their aims in life have low academic performance and low
   success rates and this implies a high risk of abandoning the degree.
   The results suggest that each university centre could consider similar
   models to elaborate a particular action plan to help lower the drop out
   rate reducing costs and efforts. As concluded in this paper, the
   profile of the students who tend to abandon their studies is dependent
   on the subject studied. For this reason, a general methodology based on
   a Data Warehouse architecture is proposed. This architecture does most
   of the work automatically and is general enough to be used at any
   university centre because it only takes into account the usual data the
   students provide when registered in a course and their grades
   throughout the years. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates the perceived barriers to adopting information
   and communication technologies (ICT) in Omani higher education. One
   hundred faculty members from four different departments at the College
   of Applied Sciences in Oman participated in the study. The participants
   took a survey, which was developed based on the Western literature.
   Five factors were extracted from the survey: lack of equipment, lack of
   institutional support, disbelief of ICT benefits, lack of confidence,
   and lack of time. The findings showed that the faculty members
   perceived moderate degrees of barriers in applying ICT to their
   teaching practices. Group differences based on gender, academic rank,
   and academic field were generally not found except for the interaction
   effects on the barriers related to lack of equipment, disbelief of ICT
   benefits, and the overall mean. Male faculty members with less usage of
   ICT perceived more barriers regarding the lack of computing equipment,
   disbeliefs of ICT benefits, and the overall barrier than the female
   counterparts. It is recommended that the survey be further refined to
   include more subtle and culturally relevant items, larger sample sizes,
   and more heterogeneous samples to validate and extend the findings.
   Important implications of this study include a need to provide more
   institutional support, technical training, and personal time for
   faculty members to learn and upgrade their knowledge and skills in
   educational technologies. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Authoring tools and methods; Distributed learning environments;
   Evaluation methodologies; Intelligent tutoring systems
AB We believe that every effectiveness evaluation should be replicated at
   least in order to verify the original results and to indicate evaluated
   e-learning system's advantages or disadvantages. This paper presents
   the methodology for conducting controlled experiment replication, as
   well as, results of a controlled experiment and an internal replication
   that investigated the effectiveness of intelligent authoring shell
   eXtended Tutor-Expert System (xTEx-Sys). The initial and the replicated
   experiment were based on our approach that combines classical two-group
   experimental design and with factoral design. A trait that
   distinguishes this approach from others is the existence of arbitrary
   number of checkpoint-tests to determine the effectiveness in
   intermediate states. We call it a pre-and-post test control group
   experimental design with checkpoint-tests. The gained results revealed
   small or even negative effect sizes, which could be explained by the
   fact that the xTEx-Sys's domain knowledge presentation is rather novel
   for students and therefore difficult to grasp and apply in earlier
   phases of the experiment. In order to develop and improve the xTEx-Sys,
   further experiments must be conducted. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB This study aims at critically reviewing recently published scientific
   literature on the use of computer and video games in Health Education
   (HE) and Physical Education (PE) with a view: (a) to identifying the
   potential contribution of the incorporation of electronic games as
   educational tools into HE and PE programs, (b) to present a synthesis
   of the available empirical evidence on the educational effectiveness of
   electronic games in HE and PE, and (c) to define future research
   perspectives concerning the educational use of electronic games in HE
   and PE. After systematically searching online bibliographic databases,
   34 relevant articles were located and included in the study. Following
   the categorization scheme proposed by [Dempsey, J., Rasmussen, K., &
   Lucassen, B. (1996). The instructional gaming literature: Implications
   and 99 sources. University of South Alabama, College of Education,
   Technical Report No. 96-1], those articles were grouped into the
   following four categories: (a) research, (b) development, (c)
   discussion and (d) theory. The overviewed articles suggest that
   electronic games present many potential benefits as educational tools
   for HE and PE, and that those games may improve young people's
   knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviours in relation to health and
   physical exercise. Furthermore, the newly emerged physically
   interactive electronic games can potentially enhance young people's
   physical fitness, motor skills and motivation for physical exercise.
   The empirical evidence to support the educational effectiveness of
   electronic games in HE and PE is still rather limited, but the findings
   present a positive picture overall. The outcomes of the literature
   review are discussed in terms of their implications for future
   research, and can provide useful guidance to educators, practitioners
   and researchers in the areas of HE and PE, and to electronic game
   designers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper attempts to identify the patterns of email use by
   schoolteachers. The findings are based on a survey of 2998 Singapore
   teachers whose teaching experiences ranged from 24 to 48 months. The
   result shows that teachers use email mainly to communicate with
   colleagues, and the degree of email use varies according to the school
   level that the teachers are working in. While the teachers teaching at
   higher school levels (Grades 11-12) email their colleagues more
   frequently than their counterparts teaching at lower school levels
   especially primary school teachers, the latter tend to email parents
   more frequently than other teachers. Implications of the findings are
   discussed in relevance to pre-service teacher education, teacher
   professional development and ICT adoption in organisations. (C) 2009

AB In its efforts to continue the modernization of its curriculum, the
   Faculty of Dentistry at the University of Toronto has developed a
   series of web-based interactive learning applications. This article
   presents the production cycle of these new interactive learning objects
   and the preliminary study conducted to measure the students' perception
   of the objects' effectiveness for learning. Three applications are
   described in detail in this article, namely: Panoramic Radiography:
   Principles and Interpretation, Gross Human Anatomy 3D Atlas and
   Restorative Dentistry: Virtual and Interactive Cavity Preparation. Each
   of these applications introduces unique elements of interactivity with
   the learning content, specifically designed to address hard-to-grasp
   concepts in their respective dental disciplines. The results of a
   student survey conducted post-deployment suggest that the visual and
   interactive features embedded in the three applications have the
   potential to induce positive outcomes in mediating the students'
   conceptualization of difficult theoretical notions. (C) 2009 Elsevier

AB Building computerized mechanisms that will accurately, immediately and
   continually recognize a learner's affective state and activate an
   appropriate response based on integrated pedagogical models is becoming
   one of the main aims of artificial intelligence in education. The goal
   of this paper is to demonstrate how the various kinds of evidence could
   be combined so as to optimize inferences about affective states during
   an online self-assessment test. A formula-based method has been
   developed for the prediction of students' mood, and it was tested using
   data emanated from experiments made with 153 high school students from
   three different regions of a European country. The same set of data is
   analyzed developing a neural network method. Furthermore, the
   formula-based method is used as an input parameter selection module for
   the neural network method. The results vindicate to a great degree the
   formula-based method's assumptions about student's mood and indicate
   that neural networks and conventional algorithmic methods should not be
   in competition but complement each other for the development of affect
   recognition systems. Moreover, it becomes apparent that neural networks
   can provide an alternative for and improvements over tutoring systems'
   affect recognition methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   system; Distributed learning environments
AB High-ranking officers require advanced military education in war
   tactics for future combat. However, line officers rarely have time to
   take such courses on campus. The conventional solution to this problem
   used to take the inefficient correspondence courses. Whereas Internet
   technologies progress, online course is the current trend for military
   training. However, the question is what distance learning methodology
   best suits such a proprietary learning purpose. This study presents a
   sequential process of developing distance learning courses in advanced
   military education. Further, the Petri-Net analytical approach is
   adopted to discover the essential interaction requirements of advanced
   military education delivered via Internet.
   This study developed a systematic method for designing e-learning
   systems according to specific requirements of target courses. The
   proposed approach starts by comparing on-campus programs with the
   existing e-learning systems to identify the steps required to transform
   the program into an e-learning system. After first outlining the
   pedagogy of the on-campus program, its proposed teaching flow through
   the Internet is then sketched. Finally, the Petri-Net model was used
   for in-depth analysis of the stages affecting the learning curve of the
   line office taking e-learning courses. The example of a "Joint
   Operations" AME course elaborated the presented approach. An e-learning
   system prototype was also designed accordingly. Lastly, an experiment
   was conducted to verify the efficiency of the presented approach. Crown

AB While there has been extensive experimental research on haptics, less
   has been conducted on cross-modal interactions between visual and
   haptic perception and even less still on cross-modal applications in
   instructional settings. This study looks at a simulation on the
   principles of levers using both visual and haptic feedback: one group
   received visual and haptic feedback while the other just visual
   feedback. Using the triangulation of learning scores, eye tracking
   data, and video analysis of interaction with the levers, the efficacy
   of haptic feedback to improve learning was explored. The results
   indicate that while the total fixation time on the levers and numeric
   readout was greater for the visual and haptic group, very similar
   patterns of visual attention were seen between groups. Perhaps
   surprisingly, the visual only group scored higher on an embedded
   assessment. Explanations for these results are synthesized from

AB Brazil is a developing country that has undergone important changes at
   the social, economic, scientific and educational levels. A main policy
   challenge at present is related to the unequal distribution of vital
   resources, including technology. In the educational context, many
   changes have been observed, such as a decrease in analphabetism and an
   increase in the number of physicians, lawyers, and scientists. In this
   paper we will describe the educational experience involving the use of
   information technology, especially computers, at Brazilian primary and
   secondary schools.
   We live in a technological era in which it is important to educate our
   children to be aware of the impact of technology on society and the
   environment in general, as well as how to personally deal with them.
   From home to workplace, digital technological tools have become a part
   of day-to-day life. Digital technology has become essential in everyday
   life, and demands have been placed on schools to educate Students so as
   to make them "technologically literate". Millions of Reals (R$) have
   been invested by the Brazilian government to equip schools with
   computers and communication tools, but low technological literacy
   remains a serious challenge. To address this problem, it is crucial to
   elucidate the real advantages and disadvantages of the use of computers
   in the educational system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Learning Management Systems (LMS) are web-based systems that allow
   instructors and/or students to share materials, submit and return
   assignments, and communicate online. in this study, we explored the
   uses and perceived benefits of using a LMS to support traditional
   classroom teaching as reported by instructors and students at a large
   American Midwestern university. We examined two years of survey data
   focusing on specific uses of the LMS that emphasized either efficient
   communication or interactive teaching and learning practices. We
   matched aggregate user log data with corresponding survey items to see
   if system use was consistent with patterns seen in the survey results.
   Findings suggest that instructors and students value tools and
   activities for efficient communication more than interactive tools for
   innovating existing practices. However, survey item analysis reveals
   that instructors and students also highly value the teaching and
   learning tools within the LMS. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB In this work, we analyze the results obtained by a group of freshmen
   students in a test of prior knowledge on technical drawing carried out
   before and after attending an introductory course on this subject. The
   aim of this course was to help students to gain knowledge necessary to
   take full advantage of the CAD software that is regularly used to teach
   engineering graphics education in the classroom. Two aspects of the
   results will be analyzed. First, if this kind of course is good enough
   to show an improvement in students' ability. As will be shown, the
   score obtained by the students improved after attending the course.
   Second, we have analyzed the results in order to know if the students'
   prior knowledge is good enough to allow them coping with their first
   year. Although the answer to this question depends on many factors, it
   will be shown that an introductory course is a useful tool to reduce
   the possible gap between the students' prior knowledge and the basic
   knowledge on geometry that should be requested to a first-year
   engineering student. The kind of test we propose here could also be
   implemented to test the cognitive abilities of the students. (C) 2009

AB Though blogs and wikis have been used to support knowledge management
   and e-learning, existing blogs and wikis cannot support different types
   of knowledge and adaptive learning. A case in point, types of knowledge
   vary greatly in category and viewpoints. Additionally, adaptive
   learning is crucial to improving one's learning performance. This study
   aims to design a semantic bliki system to tackle such issues. To
   support various types of knowledge, this study has developed a new
   social software called "bliki" that combines the advantages of blogs
   and wikis. This bliki system also applies Semantic Web technology to
   organize an ontology and a variety of knowledge types. To aid adaptive
   learning, a function called "Book" is provided to enable learners to
   arrange personalized learning goals and paths. The learning contents
   and their sequences and difficulty levels can be specified according to
   learners' metacognitive knowledge and collaborative activities. An
   experiment is conducted to evaluate this system and the experimental
   results show that this system is able to comprehend various types of
   knowledge and to improve learners' learning performance. (C) 2009

   naturally-occurring discourse that arose as part of two kinds of
   regular course activities, synchronous and asynchronous
   computer-mediated discussions. The messages contributed by members of a
   graduate course were analyzed for the kind of discourse functions and
   the kind of politeness strategies they displayed. Results indicated
   that synchronous CMD afforded more information seeking, information
   providing, and social comments than asynchronous CMD. Asynchronous
   discussions were slightly more likely to allow for such functions as
   discussion generating, experience sharing, idea explanation, and
   self-evaluation functions than synchronous discussions. Proportionately
   the two modes were similar in how politeness was expressed. Finally, in
   relating politeness and function, we found more politeness indicators
   when students were posting messages with such functions as positive
   evaluation and group conversation management, functions that carried
   the potential for face threat, and the least politeness associated with
   messages serving the function of experience sharing. (C) 2009 Published

DE Improving classroom teaching; Interdisciplinary projects;
   Teaching/learning strategies
AB Students learn more effectively with personally meaningful tasks. Thus,
   students learn more if they have a say in deciding what specific topics
   and examples are being discussed in class. Naturally, the instructor
   knows what topics are important to cover in a course and which ones
   might be optional. Finding the right balance between students'
   preferences and the instructor's requirements is not so easy and thus
   may prevent this kind of shared control of the classroom from being
   realized. This article describes how the instructor's and students'
   interests can be used to generate a list of course topics that
   satisfies both parties. However, instead of adding technology to the
   classroom, technology is used to improve the classroom experiences.
   Specifically, it is shown how course topics can be assigned to specific
   students maximizing what is meaningful to the students and satisfies
   the course parameters as defined by the instructor. This problem can be
   formulated as a variation of the linear assignment problem and solved
   with a binary linear program. Results from actual and simulated courses
   are discussed and generalizations of the topic assignment problem
   presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The implementation of new technology is becoming more important to
   schools and the success of such implementations is often due to the
   presence of ICT champions. This article examines ICT champions to
   determine whether the intention to champion ICT is determined by the
   ICT competence of school leaders. This article, based on responses from
   64 school leaders in New Zealand, reports that professional development
   and ICT usage are antecedents of ICT competency and that school leaders
   are ICT competent and willing ICT champions. These findings are
   contrary to existing research which has found that school leaders have

AB The Finnish high school system in rural areas is facing challenges
   because of a decreasing number of the students. This situation places
   new emphasis on online learning. Online learning offers new
   possibilities for high schools to provide equal learning opportunities
   for their students. This paper explores students' readiness to adapt
   their studying habits in the networked high schools by outlining their
   beliefs about online learning. Beliefs are assumed to direct people's
   actions, in this case activities concerning studying online. Three
   hundred second year high school students from Eastern Finland who had
   not had the experiences of learning online were studied. The findings
   suggest that students polarize into negative, neutral and positive
   groups based on their beliefs concerning online learning. Results also
   indicate that students' knowledge about the possibilities of online
   learning is quite superficial. In contrast to theories about
   collaborative learning practices, students see online learning rather
   differently. Students with negative and neutral beliefs especially see
   online learning merely as a static "warehouse" of materials and
   study-alone learning tasks instead of offering possibilities for
   collaborative knowledge building. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This study compared the impact of three different facilitation
   approaches on elementary teacher candidates' interactions in an
   asynchronous discussion board as well as their satisfaction with an
   online educational technology course. These participants were enrolled
   in three different sections of the same online course. In the first
   section (Group 1), the instructor responded to each student's initial
   message regarding the discussion question and then required students to
   respond to at least two of their classmates' postings. In the second
   section (Group 2), the instructor responded to each student's initial
   message to the discussion question, but did not require students to
   respond to other classmates' postings. Instead, it was the student's
   voluntary choice. In the third group (Group 3), the instructor did not
   respond to each student's initial message on the discussion question,
   but required students to respond to at least two classmates' postings.
   Data were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively, by using
   ANOVA, social networking analysis (SNA) and content analysis. The
   results indicated that in Group 2, voluntary interactions among
   students rarely occurred, resulting in the instructor primarily
   providing feedback to the students, with a low number of cues for
   social presence. in comparing Groups 1 and 3, when students were
   required to respond to one another, too much instructor intervention
   did not lead to more interactions among the students. Rather, when the
   instructor's intervention was minimal, students tended to more freely
   express their thoughts and opinions, with a large number of cues for
   social presence. However, more interactions among students, occurring
   in a required setting, may not have correlated with student
   satisfaction with the online course ratings and the instructors'
   ratings. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For years, web-based learning systems have been widely employed in both
   educational and non-educational institutions. Although web-based
   learning systems are emerging as a useful tool for facilitating
   teaching and learning activities, the number of users is not increasing
   as fast as expected. This study develops an integrated model of
   instructor adoption of web-based learning systems by incorporating
   existing literature and multiple empirically verified theories,
   including the technology acceptance model and DeLone and McLean's
   information system success model.Survey data collected from 268
   university instructors were examined using structural equation modeling
   to verify the proposed theoretical model. The research results further
   illuminate the factors that explain and predict the instructor adoption
   of web-based learning systems. Implications of this study are also
   discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study explores how pre-service student teachers acquired knowledge
   of good teaching practices through the interactive use of a video
   database and an online discussion forum, where the student teachers
   shared their teaching videos and received comments or suggestions from
   members of a learning community. A small group of student teachers was
   involved in this collaborative learning community during their teaching
   practicum in their third and fourth years of study. Content analysis of
   the sharing in the discussion forum and individual student teacher
   reflections provides insight into the use of a collaborative learning
   community to create a knowledge base for teaching. Suggestions
   regarding how this new technology can support teacher education are
   discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article presents a critical comparison of the usefulness and
   practicality of six CMC video chat tools (CUworld, ICQ, MSN Messenger,
   Paltalk, Skype, and Yahoo Messenger) from the perspective of language
   teaching professionals. This comparison is based on the results of a
   semester-long project between graduate students at an American
   university and their counterparts at a university in Turkey. The
   language teachers were asked to pair up with a partner in the
   collaborating university to test and then evaluate each of these tools
   via video chat tool evaluation sheets. They also completed an overall
   evaluation sheet commenting on CMC tools in general and ranking the
   video chat tools in terms of their potential as language teaching tools
   and their usability for personal communication purposes. The
   qualitative and quantitative analyses of the evaluation sheets indicate
   a clear preference for MSN Messenger and Skype while placing CUworld
   and Paltalk at the bottom of the list. The article also provides
   pedagogical implications and applications for using tools for language
   teaching purposes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Referential identification and resolution are considered the keys to
   help readers grasp the main idea of a text and solve lexical
   ambiguities. The goal of this study is to design a computer system for
   helping college students who learn English as a Foreign Language (EFL)
   develop mental maps of referential identification and resolution in
   reading. Four modules, Natural Language Processing (NLP), User
   Interface, Recording, and Feedback Tool, are implemented in the system.
   Results of this study showed that the more-proficient EFL readers were
   able to identify and resolve most of the references to form a coherent
   mental map from different parts of a text. The less-proficient readers
   commonly resolved references by relying on grammatical rules instead of
   semantic contextual clues. They often referred references to incorrect
   objects. To overcome the difficulties in figuring out the relationship
   between two words, the less-proficient readers usually asked for more
   feedbacks. As students progressed in reading, they requested fewer
   feedbacks in the online system. Some recommendations for future studies
   are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DESIGN-BASED RESEARCH
AB User's knowledge requirement acquisition and analysis are very
   important for a personalized or user-adaptive learning system. Two
   approaches to capture user's knowledge requirement about course content
   within an e-learning system are proposed and implemented in this paper.
   The first approach is based on the historical data accumulated by an
   interactive question-answering process. The association space is
   proposed to record and formalize the historical interactive information
   which is used to compute user's knowledge requirement. The second
   approach is based on user's reading behavior logs in the process of
   reading e-documents. User's reading actions including underline,
   highlight, circle, annotation and bookmark, are used to compute user's
   knowledge requirement. Two experiments are conducted to implement the
   two proposed approaches and acquire the user's knowledge requirement.
   The evaluation results show that the user models computed by two
   approaches are consistent and can reflect user's real knowledge
   requirements accurately. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Audience response systems (ARSs) permit students to answer
   electronically displayed multiple choice questions using a remote
   control device. All responses are instantly presented, in chart form,
   then reviewed and discussed by the instructor and the class. A brief
   history of ARSs is offered including a discussion of the 26 labels used
   to identify this technology. Next a detailed review of 67 peer-reviewed
   papers from 2000 to 2007 is offered presenting the benefits and
   challenges associated with the use of an ARS. Key benefits for using
   ARSs include improvements to the classroom environment (increases in
   attendance, attention levels, participation and engagement), learning
   (interaction, discussion, contingent teaching, quality of learning,
   learning performance), and assessment (feedback, formative, normative).
   The biggest challenges for teachers in using ARSs are time needed to
   learn and set up the ARS technology, creating effective ARS questions,
   adequate coverage of course material, and ability to respond to
   instantaneous student feedback. Student challenges include adjusting to
   a new method of learning, increased confusion when multiple
   perspectives are discussed, and negative reactions to being monitored.
   It is concluded that more systematic, detailed research is needed in a
   broader range of contexts. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by

AB Nowadays, the application of Web mining techniques in e-learning and
   Web-based adaptive educational systems is increasing exponentially. In
   this paper, we propose an advanced architecture for a personalization
   system to facilitate Web mining. A specific Web mining tool is
   developed and a recommender engine is integrated into the AHAI system
   in order to help the instructor to carry out the whole Web mining
   process. Our objective is to be able to recommend to a student the most
   appropriate links/Web pages within the AHAI system to visit next.
   Several experiments are carried out with real data provided by
   Eindhoven University of Technology students in order to test both the
   architecture proposed and the algorithms used. Finally, we have also
   described the meaning of several recommendations, starting from the
   rules discovered by the Web mining algorithms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The question of how to present cultural heritage resources in a way
   that attracts potential users is becoming important in our
   ever-changing world. This paper describes MOSAICA system - a web
   2.0-based tool-box, dedicated for the preservation and presentation of
   cultural heritage. This paper also describes an evaluation study that
   examined MOSAICA system's usability and social impact. Online
   questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were administered among
   users from Israel, France, and Poland. Findings indicated positive
   views related to MOSAICA's usage in terms of knowledge gain, ease of
   use, and attractiveness. Findings also indicated that learning about
   the stories, customs, and traditions of diverse cultures, via hypertext
   narratives, may enhance positive dispositions toward open-mindedness,
   in general, and non-judgmental views, in specific. MOSAICA system
   provides a generic framework for users, of any culture and religion, to
   actively engage in preserving their heritage via activities such as
   investigation, exploration, and storytelling. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Effectiveness of a Virtual Laboratory as a preparatory resource for
   Distance Education chemistry students

AB Many have argued that interactive 3D virtual environments have great
   educational potential due to their ability to engage learners in the
   exploration, construction and manipulation of virtual objects,
   structures and metaphorical representations of ideas. Although learning
   benefits have been demonstrated in research settings, and substantial
   usage has occurred in workplace training contexts, there are few
   published evaluations of applications of such environments within
   university contexts. This article reports on studies exploring the
   effectiveness of a virtual environment based on a chemistry laboratory
   as a tool to prepare university chemistry students studying at a
   distance for their on-campus residential schools, in response to
   evidence suggesting that many of these students experienced a lack of
   confidence and a sense of anxiety approaching these sessions. In an
   experimental study it was found that the environment was able to be
   effective as a tool for familiarising students with the laboratory,
   However, when the resource was provided to distance students, less than
   half of the students chose to use it, possibly due to the fact that use
   of the resource was not required for the assessment in the subject.
   Questionnaire and interview data suggested that most of those who used
   the resource found that it was a valuable preparatory tool and would
   recommend its further use. For many students, however, a lack of
   familiarity with the laboratory was not seen as the major source of
   their anxiety and therefore a resource allowing them to become familiar
   with the laboratory did not have a major impact on their learning
   experience. Given that the ability to apply mathematical techniques and
   chemistry concepts within the practical sessions emerged as a major
   source of students' anxiety, it is suggested that the incorporation of
   instruction or scaffolding for these aspects of the task can be
   provided, and would make a valuable enhancement to the virtual
   environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Competition, despite its potential drawbacks, is an easily adopted and
   frequently used motivator in classrooms. Individual abilities, in the
   years of schooling, are inevitably different, and performance in
   competition is heavily ability dependent, resulting that more-able
   students always win while less-able students always lose. Students
   easily perceive how well they perform through the result of
   competition, which is termed as perceived performance in this paper.
   Consistently demonstrating lower perceived performance than their
   peers, the less-able students feel discouraged and frustrated, hardly
   having the same opportunity for owning the sense of achievement as the
   more-able students. In this study, the authors designed a computerized
   mechanism, equal opportunity tactic, to lessen the difference in
   perceived performance between more-able and less-able students. Equal
   opportunity tactic is incorporated into a version of a competitive
   learning game called AnswerMatching, in which every student is assigned
   an opponent with similar ability. An experiment was also conducted to
   preliminarily investigate the effectiveness and effects of the tactic.
   Results showed that equal opportunity tactic could reduce the effect of
   individual ability difference on the perceived performance as well as
   the belief about how well students could achieve. In other words,
   less-able students could have similar opportunity of success and build
   confidence similar to more-able students in a competition. (C) 2009

AB In the last few decades, the implementation of information technology
   has given rise to several organizational training needs that have to be
   satisfied, in order to empower organizational IT performance. The users
   of new technologies have to be trained quickly and efficiently, and
   since they are usually distributed to different remote locations,
   web-based training is the preferred, and sometimes the only, process
   for employee training. This study deals with the prognosis of
   employees' intention to use a web-based training process, by extending
   the technology acceptance model using some other related factors, such
   as learning goal orientation, management support, enjoyment,
   self-efficacy and computer anxiety. Two hundred and eighty seven
   employees participated in this study to test the validity of the
   research model. The findings of the structural equation modeling
   indicate that enjoyment, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use
   directly affect employees' intention to use web-based training, while
   learning goal orientation has the strongest indirect impact on
   employees' intention. Finally, three new causal relations are proposed
   for further research. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Summary writing assessment; Intelligent tutoring systems; Latent
   semantic analysis; N-gram co-occurrence; Adaptive feedback
AB writing is an important part of many English Language Examinations. As
   grading students' summary writings is a very time-consuming task,
   computer-assisted assessment will help teachers carry out the grading
   more effectively. Several techniques such as latent semantic analysis
   (LSA), n-gram co-occurrence and BLEU have been proposed to support
   automatic evaluation of summaries. However, their performance is not
   satisfactory for assessing summary writings. To improve the
   performance, this paper proposes an ensemble approach that integrates
   LSA and n-gram co-occurrence. As a result, the proposed ensemble
   approach is able to achieve high accuracy and improve the performance
   quite substantially compared with current techniques. A summary
   assessment system based on the proposed approach has also been
   developed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One of the core courses in the undergraduate mechanical engineering
   curriculum has been completely redesigned. In the new numerical methods
   course, all assignments and learning experiences are built around a
   video/computer game. Students are given the task of writing computer
   programs to race a simulated car around a track. In doing so, students
   learn and implement numerical methods content. The design of the
   course, around a video game, is rooted in commonly accepted theories of
   how people learn. The article describes a study to assess the
   effectiveness of the video game-based course. Results show that
   students taking the game-based course, on average, spend roughly twice
   as much time, outside of class, on their course work. In a concept
   mapping exercise, students taking the game-based course demonstrate
   deeper learning compared to their counterparts taking traditional
   lecture/textbook-based numerical methods courses. (C) 2009 Elsevier

AB The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-study of
   computer-assisted instruction (CAI) studies in mathematics for students
   with learning disabilities (LD) focusing on examining the effects of
   CAI on the mathematics performance of students with LD. This study
   examined a total of I I mathematics CAI studies, which met the study
   selection criterion, for students with LD at the elementary and
   secondary levels and analyzed them in terms of their comparability and
   effect sizes. Overall, this study found that those CAI studies did not
   show conclusive effectiveness with relatively large effect sizes. The
   methodological problems in the CAI studies limit an accurate validation
   of the CAI's effectiveness. Implications for future mathematics CAI
   studies were discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Previous studies have pointed out that computer games could improve
   students' motivation to learn, but these studies have mostly targeted
   teachers or students in elementary and secondary education and are
   without user adoption models. Because business and management
   institutions in higher education have been increasingly using
   educational simulation games in recent years, factors influencing the
   continuing use of business simulation games by higher-education
   students are worth probing into. This research adopted the technology
   acceptance model, expectation confirmation theory, and agency theory as
   its theoretical base. Moreover, learning motivation and classroom
   climate from the perspective of learning, as well as perceived
   attractiveness and perceived playfulness from the perspective of
   playfulness and attractiveness were also added to the final research
   model. A total of 185 valid student respondents in Taiwan's higher
   education who have used business simulation games in their classes
   participated in the survey. The results show that perceived playfulness
   and learning performance positively influence students' satisfaction,
   which further influence the intention to use computer simulation games.
   Furthermore, perceived ease of use and perceived attraction play a
   critical role in determining perceived playfulness. Perceived ease of
   use was also positively influenced by perceived attraction. The
   research results on the students' perspective provide a strong support
   for the teachers to adopt or continue using computer simulation games
   in classrooms. However, the agency theory failed to be sustained as a
   useful too[ in motivating students' learning activities, which is
   worthy of further research. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Assuming that ICT ethics are influenced by both moral and
   circumstantial factors, the study investigates Japanese college
   students' ethical judgments and behavioral intentions in three
   scenarios involving ICT-related ethical problems and explores why they
   make such decisions, relying on five moral philosophies: moral equity,
   relativism, contractualism, egoism, and utilitarianism. The findings
   reveal that except for egoism, four moral dimensions affect ethical
   decisions of Japanese college students, each having different effects
   according to the particular ethical situation presented. Overall, the
   concepts of justice, fairness and moral rightness were found to
   influence these students' ethical judgments in all ICT-related ethical
   dilemmas; legal obligations and benefits to society were found to have
   a weaker impact. It was also found that the students may behave
   unethically in ICT-related matters if these behaviors are perceived as
   culturally or traditionally acceptable or not perceived to be morally
   wrong. in conclusion, further research is suggested to analyze various
   scenario effects on students' ICT-related ethical decisions and to
   investigate how cultural, professional and other environmental factors
   affect ethical decision-making. The establishment of a coherent ICT
   ethics policy in colleges is also proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB In this paper, a dropout prediction method for e-learning courses,
   based on three popular machine learning techniques and detailed student
   data, is proposed. The machine learning techniques used are
   feed-forward neural networks, support vector machines and probabilistic
   ensemble simplified fuzzy ARTMAP. Since a single technique may fail to
   accurately classify some e-learning students, whereas another may
   succeed, three decision schemes, which combine in different ways the
   results of the three machine learning techniques, were also tested. The
   method was examined in terms of overall accuracy, sensitivity and
   precision and its results were found to be significantly better than
   those reported in relevant literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

TI Agent-customized training for human learning performance enhancement
SO COMPUTERS & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Agent architecture; Scaffolding; Multimodal instructions; Simulation
AB Training individuals from diverse backgrounds and in changing
   environments requires customized training approaches that align with
   the individual learning styles and ever-evolving organizational needs.
   Scaffolding is a well-established instructional approach that
   facilitates learning by incrementally removing training aids as the
   learner progresses. By combining multiple training aids (i.e.
   multimodal interfaces), a trainer, either human or virtual, must make
   real-time decisions about which aids to remove throughout the training
   scenario. A significant problem occurs in implementing scaffolding
   techniques since the speed and choice of removing training aids must be
   strongly correlated to the individual traits of a specific trainee. We
   detail an agent-based infrastructure that supports the customization of
   scaffolding routines as triggered by the performance of the trainee.
   The motivation for this agent-based approach is for integration into a
   training environment that leverages augmented reality (AR)
   technologies. Initial experiments using the simulated environment have
   compared the proposed adaptive approach with traditional static
   training routines. Results show that the proposed approach increases
   the trainees' task familiarity and speed with negligible introduction
   of errors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined computer game development as a pedagogical activity
   to motivate and engage students in curriculum-related literacy
   activities. We hypothesized that as a consequence, students would
   improve their traditional reading and writing skills as well as develop
   new digital literacy skills. Eighteen classes of grade 4 students were
   assigned to either an experimental or control group. Both groups
   studied the same curriculum unit over a 10 week period, however, in
   addition the experimental group developed computer games related to the
   unit using a game development shell. An analysis of pre- and post-unit
   scores on two standardized literacy test batteries revealed that the
   experimental students performed significantly better on one of the
   subtests, a measure of logical sentence construction (p = .002). Field
   notes and teacher interview data indicated that game development helped
   improve student content retention, ability to compare and contrast
   information presented, utilize more and different kinds of research
   materials including digital resources, editing skills, and develop an
   insight into questioning skills. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The overuse of Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games
   (MMORPGs) is becoming a significant problem worldwide, especially among
   college students. Similar to Internet addiction, the pathological use
   of MMORPG is a kind of modern addiction that can affect students' lives
   on both a physical and a psychological level. The purpose of this study
   is to understand MMORPG addiction from a user experience design
   approach. We first developed a complete model that includes eleven
   factors (challenge, fantasy, curiosity, control, reward, cooperation,
   competition, recognition, belonging, obligation and role-playing) to
   represent users' experience in MMORPGs. After that, we design a
   questionnaire to measure student' gaming experience and level of
   addiction. Students' demography information, including gender and game
   playing habits, was also collected. Four hundred and eighteen Taiwanese
   college students aged 18-25 years old took part in this online survey.
   Regression analysis was then conducted to evaluate the relative
   explanatory power of each variable, with addiction score as the
   dependent variable and the eleven user experience factors as the
   independent variables. The results of regression analysis reveal five
   critical factors (curiosity, role-playing, belonging, obligation and
   reward) that can be used to predict MMORPG addiction. In addition, this
   study also infers possible casual mechanisms for increasing college
   students' level of addiction. The implications of our findings for both
   design and educational practitioners were also discussed. (C) 2009

AB This study assesses the pre-service teachers' self-reported future
   intentions to use technology in Singapore and Malaysia. A survey was
   employed to validate items from past research. Using the Technology
   Acceptance Model (TAM) as a research framework, 495 pre-service
   teachers from Singapore and Malaysia responded to an 11-item
   questionnaires containing four constructs: intention to use (ITU).
   attitude towards computer use (ATCU), perceived usefulness (PU), and
   perceived ease of use (PEU). Structural equation modelling (SEM) was
   employed as the main method of analysis in this study. A multi-group
   analysis of invariance was performed on the two samples. The results
   show that configural and metric invariance were fully supported while
   scalar and factor variance invariance were partially supported,
   suggesting that the 11-item measure of the TAM may be robust across
   cultures and that the factor loading pattern and factor loadings
   appeared to be equivalent across the cultures examined. While all the
   paths in the structural model were significant, the variance accounted
   for in the dependent variable (ITU) was much larger in the Malaysian
   sample relative to the Singaporean sample. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

ID CURRICULUM; KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION; INSTRUCTION; DILEMMAS; REFORM
AB This study relates the performance of college students in introductory
   science courses to the amount of content covered in their high school
   science courses. The sample includes 83 10 students in introductory
   biology, chemistry, or physics courses in 55 randomly chosen U.S.
   colleges and universities. Students who reported covering at least I
   major topic in depth, for a month or longer, in high school were found
   to earn higher grades in college science than did students who reported
   no coverage in depth. Students reporting breadth in their high school
   course, covering all major topics, did not appear to have any advantage
   in chemistry or physics and a significant disadvantage in biology. Care
   was taken to account for significant covariates: socioeconomic
   variables, English and mathematics proficiency, and rigor of their
   preparatory high science course. Alternative operationalizations of
   depth and breadth variables result in very similar findings. We
   conclude that teachers should use their judgment to reduce coverage in
   high school science courses and aim for mastery by extending at least I
   topic in depth over an extended period of time. (C) 2008 Wiley

AB In this Study, the evaluation of high school biology, chemistry, and
   physics teachers by their Students is examined according to the gender
   of the Student and the gender of the teacher. Female teachers are rated
   significantly lower than male teachers by male students in all three
   disciplines, whereas female students underrate female teachers only in
   physics. Interestingly, physics is also the field that suffers the
   greatest lack of females and has been criticized most for its
   androcentric culture. The gender bias in teacher ratings persists even
   when accounting for academic performance, classroom experiences, and
   family support. Furthermore, male and female teachers in each
   discipline appear equally effective at preparing their Students for
   future science study in college, Suggesting that students have a
   discipline-specific gender bias. Such a bias may negatively impact
   female Students and Contribute to the loss of females in science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. (C) 2009 Wiley

AB This research examined the nature of parent-child conversations at an
   informal science education center housed in an active
   gravitational-wave observatory. Each of 20 parent-child dyads explored
   an interactive exhibit hall privately, without the distraction of other
   visitors. Parents employed a variety of strategies to support their
   children's understanding of unfamiliar topics, including describing
   evidence, giving direction, providing explanation, making connections,
   and eliciting predictions. Parents' education was associated with both
   the amount of time dyads spent exploring exhibits and the proportion of
   exhibits at which parents made connections to prior experiences.
   Parents' attitudes toward science were likewise associated with the
   proportion of exhibits visited. Parent-child dyads spent more time at
   exhibits that encouraged Active Prolonged Engagement (APE). Parents
   elicited predictions more often at APE exhibits, and children described
   evidence and gave direction more often at APE exhibits. Thus, both
   participant characteristics and exhibit qualities were found to
   contribute to parent-child interactions in an informal science setting.

DT Article
ID SCIENTIFIC LITERACY; PRACTICAL EPISTEMOLOGIES; KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION;
   ISSUES; WORK
AB In this paper, we describe two central epistemological norms related to
   the importance of making investigations and to scientific language and
   its logic. These norms have been identified in empirical material
   consisting of 200 video-recorded lessons in three different science
   classes. With regard to the learning of science and socialization, we
   discuss and problematize these norms in the context of science learned
   at school and the nature of science. A methodological approach has been
   developed and used to analyze and identify the role that teachers'
   actions play in which epistemology students adopt in their meaning
   making and to highlight which view of science this usage represents.
   The approach consists of a combination of three methodologies:
   practical epistemology analyses, epistemological move analyses, and
   analyses of companion meanings. This combination produces communication
   analysis of companion meanings. The theory is based oil pragmatism,
   sociocultural approaches to learning, and the later works of
   Wittgenstein. The companion meanings described in the empirical
   material indicate that if Students learn the identified norms without
   any explicit problematization, they will only view science as rational
   and inductive in character and exclude alternative views from the
   practice. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals. Inc. Sci Ed 93:859-874. 2009

TI Making Classroom Assessment More Accountable to Scientific Reasoning: A
   Case for Attending to Mechanistic Thinking
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID YOUNG-CHILDREN; INQUIRY; SCIENCE
AB When teachers or students assess the quality of ideas in science
   classes, the do so mostly based on textbook correctness; ideas are good
   to the extent they align with or lead to the content as presented in
   the textbook or curriculum. Such appeals to authority are at odds with
   the values and practices within the disciplines of science. There has
   been significant amount of attention to this mismatch in the science
   education research literature, primarily with respect to
   experimentation and argumentation as core disciplinary means of
   assessing ideas. In this article, we call attention to another aspect
   of scientific reasoning: a focus on causal mechanisms in explaining
   natural phenomena. We highlight examples and research from the history
   and philosophy of science to clarify what scientists mean by
   "mechanism" and to make the case for its centrality. We then present an
   excerpt from a second-grade class in which a student provides an
   incorrect mechanistic explanation, and the teacher gives priority to
   textbook correctness. As the conversation proceeds, the student shifts
   from mechanistic sensemaking to quoting terminology she does not
   understand. We argue that attention to mechanism in the classroom would
   better support student reasoning and better reflect disciplinary
   epistemology. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals. Inc. Sci Ed 93:875-891.2009

   American Science Extracurriculum

ID MUSEUMS; CURRICULUM; REFORM; WAR
AB At the 1939-1940 New York World's Fair, several thousand boys and
   girls, ail members of a growing national network of high school science
   and engineering Clubs, displayed their science fair projects and
   conducted live experiments to more than 10 million visitors. Housed in
   the building sponsored by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing
   Company. their exhibits depicted a wide range of scientific phenomena.
   They also represented the conflicting values of science educators and
   industrialists about the societal worth of science education. In some
   instances, Students' projects and laboratory activities prized hands-on
   learning and aimed to abet widespread rational thinking for democratic
   citizenship, which reflected the civic priorities of Progressive
   science educators. In other cases. science was presented as a magical
   spectacle with consumer applications intended to entertain and inspire
   the public's confidence in American industry and scientific experts.
   Ultimately, the corporate sponsorship of the high school science
   extracurriculum at the World's Fair marked a turning point when the
   Progressive purposes of science education bel,an to give way to
   "manpower" and "professionalist" ends that aligned with the nation's
   economic and military imperatives. This historical episode also
   anticipated recent proposals to reform science education in the United
   States and ideas about scientific learning ill museum settings. (C)

TI Elementary School Teachers as "Targets and Agents of Change": Teachers'
   Learning in Interaction With Reform Science Curriculum
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; CHILDRENS; PERFORMANCE;
   KNOWLEDGE; MODELS
AB This article examines teachers' perspectives on the challenges of using
   a science reform curriculum, as well as their learning in interaction
   With the curriculum and parallel professional development program. As
   case studies, I selected 4 veteran teachers of 2nd or 3rd grade, with
   varying science backgrounds (including 2 with essentially none).
   Capitalizing on the first activity of the monthly teacher meetings,
   wherein each teacher described an issue/challenge in using the
   curriculum, I analyzed how their conceptualization of issues changed
   over 5 points in time, 2 in the fall of I school year and 3 in the
   spring of the next. Exit interviews extend the time span under analysis
   to 32 months. Across this span, I examined the extent to which their
   thinking about the issues they raised reflected the problematic, in
   Dewey's sense of catalyst for fruitful taking tip of the problem in
   ways supporting learning. Given the importance of understanding science
   as a way of knowing, I also analyzed their thinking vis-a-vis S. Carey
   and C. Smith's ( 1993) scientific knowledge-construction Continuum from
   "knowledge unproblematic" to "knowledge problematic." Analyses indicate
   that 3 of the 4 achieved fundamental advancements in their thinking,
   although of different forms and through different mechanisms of change.

AB This study investigates effects of multimedia on cognitive load,
   self-efficacy and learners' ability to solve multiple rule-based
   problems. Two hundred twenty-two college students were randomly
   assigned to interactive and non-interactive multimedia groups. Based on
   Engelkamp's multimodal theory, the present study investigates the role
   of multimedia in multiple rule-based problem solving. The findings
   indicate that providing learners with manipulative function in
   multimedia would facilitate their problem solving through reduced
   cognitive load and improved self-efficacy. The study identifies a
   significant mediator effect for self-efficacy that mediates between
   multimedia and learners' problem solving. Discussion focuses on the
   effects of multimedia and self-efficacy on learners' performance in
   multiple rule-based problem solving. Suggestions are made with regard
   to the design of problem solving in future studies.

AB The purpose of the study reported on in this paper was to identify
   performance criteria and ratings in rubrics designed for the evaluation
   of learning in online asynchronous discussions (OADs) in post-secondary
   contexts. We analysed rubrics collected from Internet sources. Using
   purposive sampling, we reached saturation with the selection of 50
   rubrics. Using keyword analysis and subsequent grouping of keywords
   into categories, we identified 153 performance criteria in 19
   categories and 831 ratings in 40 categories. We subsequently identified
   four core categories as follows: cognitive (44.0%), mechanical (19.0%),
   procedural/managerial (18.29%) and interactive (17.17%). Another 1.52%
   of ratings and performance criteria were labelled vague and not
   assigned to any core category.

ID SCIENCE; STUDENTS; TOOLS
AB The purpose of this paper is to compare the effects of paper-based and
   computer-based concept mappings on computer hardware achievement,
   computer anxiety and computer attitude of the eight grade secondary
   school students. The students were randomly allocated to three groups
   and were given instruction on computer hardware. The teaching methods
   used for each group were the conventional method, paper-based concept
   mapping and computer-based concept mapping. At the end of a 4-week
   instruction, posttests were administered to assess computer hardware
   achievement, computer anxiety and computer attitude of the students.
   The findings indicate that paper-based and computer-based concept
   mapping strategies produce better results than the conventional method.
   However, the effects of paper-based and computer-based concept mapping
   strategies were not significantly different.

TI I've stuck to the path I'm afraid': exploring student non-use of
   blended learning
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PLAGIARISM; UNIVERSITY; COMPUTERS; INTERNET; WORK
AB This paper draws on qualitative data from a study of student use of
   blended learning as part of a conventionally taught undergraduate
   Sociology course. Findings from an early evaluation questionnaire
   highlighted an overwhelming pattern of non-use of the materials and
   subsequent research with a group of 16 students evidenced limited and
   inconsistent engagement with the resources. In an analysis of the
   category 'non-use', the students' rejection of the materials is seen to
   be closely related to a trust in traditional texts as authentic
   academic knowledge and an instrumental and strategic approach to study.
   Blended learning resources are shown to challenge existing learning
   patterns and practices, reconfigure existing understandings and
   expectations of academic scholarship and reconstruct academic
   boundaries in new spaces.

ID FEEDBACK; TECHNOLOGY; EDUCATION; LECTURES
AB Although a number of researchers have examined response pad systems
   (RPSs) in higher education, there has been very little research at the
   K-12 level. This paper investigated the impact of using an RPS in the
   learning of physics concepts in a secondary school in Singapore. Two
   classes (n = 35 students in each class) of secondary five students
   participated in this study. One of the classes used an RPS while the
   other did not. Both classes completed a pretest and a posttest which
   tested the students in the application of the physics concepts taught.
   Results suggested that the class that used an RPS performed better in
   the posttest compared to the class that did not use the system. In
   addition, we explored the teacher and students' perceptions of using
   the RPS.

ID PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT
AB A pair of papers re-examined the evidence from a national initiative to
   train all teachers in England to bring them up to the level of newly
   qualified teachers, who are required to know when to use and when not
   to use information and communication technologies (ICT) in their
   professional practice. The first paper confirmed that multilevel
   evaluation of professional development was robust for ICT teacher
   training. This second paper contrasts the highest and lowest rated
   designs for ICT teacher training: an 'organic' approach that provided
   training in schools was highly rated, whereas a centralised
   computer-assisted learning approach with online access to trainers was
   the lowest rated design. The study supports an ecological view of the
   diffusion of ICT innovations in education and recommends that ICT
   teacher training be designed to support evolution of each teacher's
   classroom, school and region, as well as the training of the ICT
   teacher trainers.

ID PROGRESSIVE INQUIRY; PARTICIPATION; DISCOURSE; PATTERNS; ISSUES;

AB The purpose of the present paper was to examine three generations of
   research on technology-mediated learning carried on by the present
   investigator's research group. The first generation focused on
   examining computer-supported collaborative learning from the cognitive
   perspective. The main focus was to examine to what extent
   knowledge-seeking inquiry elicited conceptual change. Problems of
   transferring inquiry learning culture from one country to another
   pushed us to examine social practices and other participatory aspects
   of learning that had been invisible to cognitive researchers. The
   second-generation research focused on analyzing patterns of
   participation in computer-supported collaborative learning. The
   emerging third generation research aims at overcoming the dichotomy
   between the cognitive (knowledge acquisition) perspective and
   socio-cultural (participation) perspective by means of long-standing
   and deliberate efforts of knowledge-creation, involving what is called
   objects of activity. Theoretical and methodological implications of the
   generations are discussed.

ID IMPROVING SPATIAL ABILITY; SEX-DIFFERENCES; META-ANALYSIS; EXPERIENCE
AB An experimental study involving 30 undergraduates (mean age = 20.5
   years) in mental rotation (MR) training was conducted in an interactive
   Desktop Mental Rotation Trainer (iDeMRT). Stratified random sampling
   assigned students into one experimental group and one control group.
   The former trained in iDeMRT and the latter trained in conventional
   condition. A multifactorial pretest posttest design procedure was used
   and data were analysed using two-way analysis of covariance. Overall,
   there was substantial improvement in MR accuracy. Main effects of
   training and gender were observed, indicating that iDeMRT group and
   boys outperformed the control group and girls respectively. In
   addition, an interaction between training method and gender was
   present, indicating that boys were more accurate when trained in iDeMRT
   and performed moderately in conventional method. Female participants
   achieved equivalent improvement gain in MR accuracy regardless of the
   training conditions used. For the speed measure of MR, no appreciable
   improvement was observed after training.

AB In this paper, we present the comprehensive version of CSIEC (Computer
   Simulation in Educational Communication), an interactive web-based
   human-computer dialogue system with natural language for English
   instruction, and its tentative application and evaluation in English
   education. First, we briefly introduce the motivation for this project,
   survey the related works and illustrate the system structure with flow
   diagram. Then we describe its pedagogical functions, especially free
   chatting and chatting on a given topic. We summarise the free Internet
   usage within 6 months and introduce its integration into English
   classrooms, as well as the formal evaluation results of the
   integration. The evaluation findings show that the chatting function
   has been improved and fully used by the users, and the application of
   the CSIEC system in English instruction can motivate the learners to
   use English and enhance their learning process. Lastly, we discuss the
   application-driven approach of system development and draw some
   conclusions for future improvement.

TI Primary pupils' use of information and communication technologies at
   school and home
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID INTERACTIVE WHITEBOARDS; COMPUTER USE; ICT; PERCEPTIONS; EDUCATION
AB Based on survey data from 612 pupils in five English primary schools,
   this paper investigates children's engagement with information and
   communication technologies (ICTs) inside and outside the school
   context. Analysis of the data shows pupils' engagements with ICTs to be
   often perfunctory and unspectacular, especially within the school
   setting, where the influence of year group and school attended are
   prominent. Whilst the majority of children felt that ICT use led to
   gains in learning, the paper discusses how there was a strong sense of
   educational uses of ICTs being constrained by the nature of the schools
   within which 'educational' use was largely framed and often situated.
   The paper concludes by suggesting possible changes to ICT provision in
   primary schools, most notably relaxing school restrictions regarding
   Internet access and developing meaningful dialogues with pupils about
   future forms of educational ICT use.

DE learning progressions; complex thinking; biology
ID HIGH-SCHOOL
AB In order to compete in a global economy, students are going to need
   resources and curricula focusing on critical thinking and reasoning in
   science. Despite awareness for the need for complex reasoning, American
   students perform poorly relative to peers on international standardized
   tests measuring complex thinking in science. Research focusing on
   learning progressions is one effort to provide more coherent science
   curricular sequences and assessments that can be focused on complex
   thinking about focal science topics. This article describes an
   empirically driven, five-step process to develop a 3-year learning
   progression focusing on complex thinking about biodiversity. Our
   efforts resulted in empirical results and work products including: (1)
   a revised definition of learning progressions, (2) empirically driven,
   3-year progressions for complex thinking about biodiversity, (3) an
   application of statistical approaches for the analysis of learning
   progression products, (4) Hierarchical Linear Modeling results
   demonstrating significant student achievement on complex thinking about
   biodiversity, and (5) Growth Model results demonstrating strengths and
   weaknesses of the first version of our Curricular units. The empirical
   studies present information to inform both curriculum and assessment
   development. For curriculum development, the role of learning
   progressions as templates for the development of organized sequences of
   curricular units focused on complex science is discussed. For
   assessment development, learning progression-guided assessments provide
   a greater range and amount of information that can more reliably
   discriminate between students of differing abilities than a contrasting
   standardized assessment measure that was also focused on biodiversity

AB Modeling is a core practice in science and a central part of scientific
   literacy. We present theoretical and empirical motivation for a
   learning progression for scientific modeling that aims to make the
   practice accessible and meaningful for learners. We define scientific
   modeling as including the elements of the practice (constructing,
   using, evaluating, and revising scientific models) and the
   metaknowledge that guides and motivates the practice (e.g.,
   understanding the nature and purpose of models). Our learning
   progression for scientific modeling includes two dimensions that
   combine metaknowledge and elements of practice-scientific models as
   tools for predicting and explaining, and models change as understanding
   improves. We describe levels of progress along these two dimensions of
   our progression and illustrate them with classroom examples from 5th
   and 6th graders engaged in modeling. Our illustrations indicate that
   both groups of learners productively engaged in constructing and
   revising increasingly accurate models that included powerful
   explanatory mechanisms, and applied these models to make predictions
   for closely related phenomena. Furthermore, we show how students
   engaged in modeling practices move along levels of this progression. In
   particular, students moved from illustrative to explanatory models, and
   developed increasingly sophisticated views of the explanatory nature of
   models, shifting from models as correct or incorrect to models as
   encompassing explanations for multiple aspects of a target phenomenon.
   They also developed more nuanced reasons to revise models. Finally, we
   present challenges for learners in modeling practices-such as
   understanding how constructing a model can aid their own sensemaking,
   and seeing model building as a way to generate new knowledge rather
   than represent what they have already learned. (C) 2009 Wiley

TI A Learning Progression for Deepening Students' Understandings of Modern

AB Over the past several decades, there has been a tremendous growth in
   our understanding of genetic phenomena and the intricate and
   complicated mechanisms that mediate genetic effects. Given the
   complexity of content in modern genetics and the inadequacy of current
   instructional methods and materials it seems that a more coherent and
   extensive approach to teaching modern genetics is needed. Learning
   progressions provide such an approach by describing the learning of
   core concepts in a domain as it unfolds, over multiple grades and grade
   hands. In this paper we suggest a learning progression for modern
   genetics that spans grades 5-10. We describe the learning progression
   in terms of three key aspects of teaching and learning modern genetics:
   ( 1) the big ideas in modern genetics, and the knowledge and abilities
   that students should master by the end of compulsory education; and (2)
   the progression of learning that students are expected to make over
   several grades; and (3) the identification of learning performances and
   development of assessments for the proposed progression. We conclude by
   identifying the implications for instruction and research that stern
   from our analysis of the research base in genetics education, and our
   development of a theoretical progression for learning the big ideas in
   modern genetics. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 46:

AB This study reports on our steps toward achieving a conceptually
   coherent and empirically validated learning progression for carbon
   cycling in socio-ecological systems. It describes an iterative process
   of designing and analyzing assessment and interview data from students
   in upper elementary through high school. The product of our development
   process-the learning progression itself-is a story about how learners
   from upper elementary grades through high school develop understanding
   in an important and complex domain: biogeochemical processes that
   transform carbon in socio-ecological systems at multiple scales. These
   processes: (a) generate organic carbon (photosynthesis), (b) transform
   organic carbon (biosynthesis, digestion, food webs, carbon
   sequestration), and (c) oxidize organic carbon (cellular respiration,
   combustion). The primary cause of global climate change is the current
   worldwide imbalance among these processes. We identified Levels of
   Achievement, which described patterns in the way students made progress
   toward more sophisticated reasoning about these processes. Younger
   learners perceived a world where events occurred at a macroscopic scale
   and carbon Sources, Such as foods and fuels, were treated as enablers
   of life processes and combustion rather than sources of matter
   transformed by those processes. Students at the transitional
   levels-levels 2 and 3-traced matter in terms of materials changed by
   hidden mechanisms (level 2) or changed by chemical processes (level 3).
   More advanced students (level 4) used chemical models to trace matter
   through hierarchically organized systems that connected organisms and
   inanimate matter. Although level 4 reasoning is consistent with current
   national standards, few high school Students reasoned this way
   consistently. We discuss further plans for conceptual and empirical
   validation of the learning progression. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals,

AB Assessments associated with learning progressions are designed to
   provide diagnostic information about the level and nature of student
   understanding. Valid interpretations of such diagnoses are only
   possible when Students consistently express the ideas associated with a
   single learning progression level. Latent class analysis was employed
   to evaluate whether patterns of expected responses to diagnostic
   multiple-choice items afforded valid interpretations of learning
   progression level diagnoses. Results indicated that students with
   scientifically accurate understanding of the forces acting on ail
   object with constant speed usually reasoned systematically across
   items, but many other students did not. Consequently, interpretations
   of learning progression level diagnoses on a proposed learning
   progression would often be invalid. Analyses of this sort would be
   useful in developing and validating future learning progressions. (C)

AB This article describes some of the underlying conceptualizations that
   have gone into the work of the BEAR Center in the development of
   learning progressions. The core of all of these developments has been
   the construct map, which is the first building block in the BEAR
   Assessment System (BAS). After introducing the concept of a learning
   progression, the article summarizes the elements of the BAS,
   emphasizing the central concept of a construct map. The article then
   describes a series of several different ways to see the relationship
   between the idea of a construct map and the idea of a progression
   (which I call the "assessment structure"), and also gives illustrative
   examples from recent BEAR projects. The article then discusses some
   strengths and limitations of these conceptualizations, focusing on both
   educational and measurement issues. The article concludes with some
   general reflections. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach

AB Meiosis is a biological concept that is both complex and important for
   students to learn. This study aims to explore first-year biology
   students' explanations of the process of meiosis, using an explicit
   theoretical framework provided by the Structure of the Observed
   Learning Outcome ( SOLO) model. The research was based on responses of
   334 first-year biology students to practical and examination questions
   about meiosis, together with student interviews. Students' written
   responses were coded, which resulted in a hierarchy of qualitatively
   different categories consistent with recent developments in the SOLO
   model. Most responses described a number of the less abstract elements
   of meiosis, but not in a coherent, relational manner, and interviews
   elucidated several areas of confusion about meiosis and its subordinate
   concepts. These findings are consistent with much previous research,
   and provide insights into both the use of the SOLO model as a research
   tool and students' understandings of meiosis. In conjunction with
   previous research, the results of this study raise questions beyond its
   local context about the match between students' apparent understandings
   and university expectations. The implications of the study relate to
   the use of terminology, the treatment of meiosis in textbooks, and some
   specific issues of pedagogy.

TI Using Concept Cartoons in Formative Assessment: Scaffolding students'
   argumentation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCHOOL SCIENCE; CLASSROOM
AB The purpose of this study was to investigate how concept cartoons,
   together with other diagnostic and scaffolding tools, could be used in
   formative assessment, to stimulate talk and argumentation among
   students in small groups, as part of peer-assessment and
   self-assessment; and to provide diagnostic feedback about students'
   misconceptions to the teacher for teaching towards conceptual change.
   Two classes of Primary 5 and 6 students worked in small groups to
   discuss the opposing viewpoints posed by the cartoon characters, using
   scaffolding tools to guide their discussions and to evaluate,
   challenge, and document each others' ideas. Students also used drawings
   to depict their ideas. The conversation from one group was audio-taped.
   These tools provided a record of students' thinking in a form that was
   accessible to the teacher for monitoring and feedback purposes.
   Findings showed dialogic talk and interactive argumentation among
   students where they made their reasoning visible. Students' assertions
   and questions had formative potential as they encouraged exploratory
   and reflective discourse by drawing upon each others' ideas. The
   teacher's discursive practices, as well as her role in designing
   scaffolding structures for supporting 'assessment conversations' when
   using concept cartoons and in devising strategies that take into
   account students' conceptual and epistemic thinking, are emphasised.

TI College Students' Conceptions of Chemical Stability: The widespread
   adoption of a heuristic rule out of context and beyond its range of
   application
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CHEMISTRY EDUCATION; SCIENCE; SUBSTANCES; MODELS; PUPILS
AB This paper reports evidence that learners commonly develop a notion of
   chemical stability that, whilst drawing upon ideas taught in the
   curriculum, is nevertheless inconsistent with basic scientific
   principles. A series of related small-scale studies show that many
   college-level students consider a chemical species with an octet
   structure, or a full outer shell, will necessarily be more stable than
   a related species without such an electronic configuration. Whilst this
   finding is in itself consistent with previous research, the present
   paper shows how students commonly apply this criterion without
   consideration of chemical context, or other significant factors such as
   net charge. Species that would seem highly unstable and non-viable from
   chemical considerations, such as Na7-, C4+ and even Cl11-, are commonly
   judged as being stable. This research shows that many college-level
   students are privileging a simple heuristic (species with full outer
   shells will be stable) when asked about the stability of chemical
   species at the submicroscopic level, to the exclusion of more pertinent
   considerations. Some students will even judge an atom in an excited
   state as more stable than when in the ground state, when an electron is
   promoted from an inner shell to 'fill' the outer shell. It is suggested
   that the apparently widespread adoption of a perspective that is so at
   odds with the science in the curriculum is highly significant for the
   teaching of chemistry, and indicates the need for more detailed studies
   of how such thinking develops and can be challenged.

AB The application of Biggs' and Collis' Structure of Observed Learning
   Outcomes taxonomy in the evaluation of student learning about cell
   membrane transport via a computer-based learning environment is
   described in this study. Pre-test-post-test comparisons of student
   outcome data (n = 80) were made across two groups of randomly assigned
   students: one that received visual and haptic feedback, and one that
   relied on visual feedback only as they completed their virtual
   investigations. The results of the Mann-Whitney U-test indicated that
   the group mean difference scores were significantly different
   statistically (p = .043). Practically speaking, this study provides
   some early evidence suggesting that the haptic augmentation of
   computer-based science instruction may lead to a deeper level of
   processing. The strengths and weaknesses of this current diagnostic
   approach and a novel approach based on a non-verbal model of cognition
   are discussed in light of their potential contributions to the teaching
   and learning of science.

AB The aim of the research was to investigate the effect of the amount and
   quality of content knowledge on pedagogical content knowledge (PCK).
   The biological content photosynthesis and plant growth was used as an
   example. The research sample consisted of 10 primary and 10 secondary (
   biology) teacher students. Questionnaires, lesson preparation task and
   an interview were used to collect data. Primary student-teachers' were
   not aware of students' conceptual difficulties and had problems in
   choosing the most important content. Neither of the groups had
   knowledge on suitable experiments and demonstrations, which indicates
   that PCK should be explicitly taught. The usefulness of PCK and some
   related constructs in initial teacher training is discussed.

AB The aim of this research was to explore Australian high-school
   students' argumentation and informal reasoning about biotechnology.
   Data were obtained from semi-structured interviews with 10 Year-8
   students (12-13 years old), 14 Year-10 students (14-15 years old) and 6
   Year-12 students (16-17 years old) from six metropolitan high schools
   in Perth, Western Australia. The transcripts were analysed using both
   Toulmin's argumentation pattern and informal reasoning patterns
   (rational, emotive, and intuitive) as frameworks. The notion of
   scientific literacy was used as the basis of the theoretical framework
   to examine the data. Most students used no data or only simple data to
   justify their claims. Students of all year groups used intuitive and
   emotive informal reasoning more frequently than rational. Rational
   informal reasoning was associated with more sophisticated arguments.

TI Water Transformation and Storage in the Mountains and at the Coast:
   Midwest students' disconnected conceptions of the hydrologic cycle
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL MODELS; CHILDREN; EARTH
AB The purpose of the present study was to investigate students'
   conceptions of the hydrologic cycle and to examine whether these
   conceptions vary by grade level and community setting. This study was
   descriptive in nature and reflected a cross-age design involving the
   collection of qualitative data from 1,298 students from the Midwest,
   USA. These data were analysed for content in an inductive manner to
   identify student's conceptions, and statistical analysis was used to
   determine the significance in the frequency of these student
   conceptions. Four categories emerged that reflected different degrees
   of sophistication of students' conceptions of water transformation,
   movement, and storage. These Midwest students often portrayed the
   hydrologic cycle in the context of mountain or coastal landscapes that
   are common in textbooks but that are not representative of the
   environments where students live and where many of these students might
   apply their understanding of environmental systems as adults. Based on
   these findings, we make curricular recommendations that build on the
   students' conceptions, the hydrologic concept, and the National
   Research Council science education standards.

TI An Integrative Perspective on Students' Proportional Reasoning in High
   School Physics in a West African Context
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CULTURE; SCIENCE
AB This study examines students' use of proportional reasoning in high
   school physics problem-solving in a West African school setting. An
   in-depth, constructivist, and interpretive case study was carried out
   with six physics students from a co-educational senior secondary school
   in Nigeria over a period of five months. The study aimed to elicit
   students' meanings, claims, concerns, constructions, and
   interpretations of their difficulty with proportional reasoning as they
   worked on a series of 18 high school physics tasks. Multiple
   qualitative research techniques were employed to generate, analyse, and
   interpret data. Results indicated that several socio-cultural,
   psychosocial, cognitive, and mathematical issues were associated with
   students' use of proportional reasoning in physics. Students' capacity
   to reason proportionally was not only linked to their difficulty with
   the concept, structure, and strategies of proportional reasoning as a
   learning and problem-solving skill, but was also embedded in the
   social, cultural, cognitive, and contextual elements involved in the
   learning of physics. The study concludes with a discussion of the
   implications for teaching high school physics.

TI Estimating Linear Size and Scale: Body rulers
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPUTATIONAL ESTIMATION; REPRESENTATIONS; ABILITIES; KNOWLEDGE
AB The National Science Education Standards emphasise the use of concepts
   and skills that cut across the science domains. One of these
   cross-cutting areas is measurement. Students should know measurement
   systems, units of measurement, tools and error in measurement as well
   as the importance of measurement to scientific endeavours. Even though
   measurement is an essential skill, little is known about how students
   estimate and use measurement in different contexts. This study examines
   the impact of teaching students to use their bodies as rough
   measurement tools (body rulers) on their ability to estimate linear
   measurements. Nineteen middle school students participated in metric
   intervention tasks and completed a pre-instruction and a
   post-instruction Linear Measurement Assessment. Results showed that
   teaching students to use rough body measures as tools (a body ruler)
   for estimation had a significant influence on their estimation
   accuracy. After instruction, students were better able to estimate the
   sizes of objects, use their body in making estimations of size, and
   estimate while touching an object or pacing a distance. Furthermore,
   proportional reasoning was significantly correlated with students'
   post-instruction scores on the Linear Measurement Assessment.

TI Comparison of Two Small-group Learning Methods in 12th-grade Physics
   Classes Focusing on Intrinsic Motivation and Academic Performance
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SELF-DETERMINATION
AB Twelfth-grade physics classes with 344 students participated in a
   quasi-experimental study comparing two small-group learning settings.
   In the jigsaw classroom, in contrast to the cyclical rotation method,
   teaching expectancy as well as resource interdependence is established.
   The study is based on the self-determination theory of motivation,
   which states that the satisfaction of the 'basic needs' for
   experiencing autonomy, competence, and social relatedness is essential
   to promote intrinsic motivation. Regarding the experience of
   competence, a small effect in favour of the jigsaw classroom was found,
   whereas students in the cyclical rotation setting showed mediumsized
   benefits in experiencing autonomy. A path analysis revealed that these
   opposing effects balanced each other; that is, no effect from
   small-group method to intrinsic motivation was found. In contrary to
   the motivational variables, achievement effects depended on the
   underlying study topic: based on scanning electron microscopy, the
   cyclical rotation setting outperformed jigsaw classroom, whereas an
   opposed trend is observed with regard to the microwave oven learning
   unit. The higher interestingness of the latter learning unit was
   revealed as a weak mediator from study topic to academic achievement.

TI A Conflict in Your Head: An exploration of trainee science teachers'
   subject matter knowledge development and its impact on teacher
   self-confidence
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE; BELIEFS; BIOLOGY
AB Teachers' subject matter knowledge (SMK) is one factor contributing to
   teaching 'successfully', as this provides a basis from which
   pedagogical content knowledge develops. UK-based trainee science
   teachers teach all sciences to age 14 and often up to age 16. Trainees
   have specialist science knowledge in chemistry, physics, or biology
   from their degrees. Other sciences may not have been studied since
   school. Thus, trainee science teachers often teach 'outside
   specialism'. The extent to which teaching within and outside specialism
   influences successful teaching, ensuring learning objectives are
   achieved, was investigated. The sources seventy-one trainees use for
   preparing within and outside specialism science lessons for
   11-14-year-olds and 14-16-yearolds and effects on teacher
   self-confidence of working in these two domains were probed by
   questionnaire and interview. All trainees responded to open and closed
   questions, and Likert-scale statements exploring preferences for
   teaching, self-confidence, handling subject-related questions within
   and outside specialism, and attitudes towards learning new SMK. A
   subgroup of 12 trainees participated in individual semi-structured
   interviews. The results are counter-intuitive: trainees teach more
   successful lessons outside their specialism, particularly in the early
   stages. This relates to using a richer range of SMK sources, including,
   crucially, advice from experienced colleagues. Within specialism,
   trainees report an inability to select appropriate knowledge and/or
   strategies and a sense of conflict in teaching inaccurate information.
   Some 'anxious' trainees rely heavily on extant materials for outside
   specialism teaching. 'Super-confident' trainees able to teach any
   science focus on selection of appropriate instructional strategies and
   realise early on the need to transform SMK.

   CONCEPTS; EARTH; COSMOLOGIES; ARTIFACTS; CYCLE
AB The US National Science Education Standards and the Benchmarks for
   Science Literacy recommend that students understand the apparent
   patterns of motion of the Sun, Moon, and stars by the end of early
   elementary school, yet no research has specifically examined these
   concepts from an Earth-based perspective with this age group. This
   study examines children's understanding of the patterns of apparent
   celestial motion among first-grade, third-grade, and eighth-grade
   students, and investigates the extent to which these concepts develop
   from elementary to middle school in students without targeted
   instruction. Twenty students at each grade level (total n = 60) were
   interviewed using a novel interview setting: a small dome representing
   the sky, which allowed students to demonstrate their ideas. Analysis
   reveals that elementary and middle school students hold a variety of
   non-scientific ideas about all aspects of apparent celestial motion.
   While the eighth-grade students' understanding of the apparent motion
   of the Sun shows a greater level of accuracy compared with the
   third-grade students, across the majority of topics of apparent
   celestial motion, the overall level of accuracy shows little change
   from third grade to eighth grade. Just as prior research has
   demonstrated the need for instruction to improve children's
   understanding of the nature of celestial objects and their actual
   motions, these results support the need for research on instructional
   strategies that improve students' understanding of celestial motion as
   seen from their own perspective.

DT Article
ID MENTAL MODELS; SCIENCE
AB The research set out in this paper seeks to develop pedagogical
   knowledge regarding how persuasive teaching approaches can be developed
   in primary science classrooms. To achieve this, the paper examines
   three case studies in which the teachers have been charged to develop
   and implement teaching strategies designed to persuade their children
   of the usefulness and validity of target scientific concepts. The
   analysis probes the teachers' choice of contexts and patterns of
   discourse using criteria drawn from the socio-cultural literature.
   Outcomes of the study exemplify how the teachers' choices of learning
   contexts fail to emphasise the functionality of the target concepts,
   and as a consequence scant rewards are provided for the children to
   participate actively in conceptually rich discourse. The final part of
   the paper explores how the development of what the author calls
   theme-specific plots could be used to help teachers to stage teaching
   and learning performances that emphasise the functionality of specific
   explanatory models.

AB In this paper we present results from a 10-year (1997-2006)
   longitudinal study in which we, by interviews once or twice every year,
   followed how students, throughout the compulsory school, developed
   their understanding of three situations in which transformations of
   matter occur. We believe that students have to meet scientific ideas
   early in order to gradually, in social cooperation with classmates,
   friends, teachers, and other grown-ups, elaborate the meaning of a
   concept. We followed 23 students all born in 1990. In 1997 we
   introduced the idea of the particulate nature of matter. We have
   conducted interviews allowing students to explain the transformation of
   matter in fading leaves left lying on the ground, burning candles, and
   a glass of water with a lid on. In the interview at 16 years of age,
   less than one-fifth of the students use molecular ideas in
   scientifically acceptable ways. The overall conclusion is that most
   students do not connect the knowledge they gain in school about the
   particulate nature of matter to these everyday situations. On the other
   hand, the students seem capable of using a simple particle model and
   the model can help them understand the invisible gas state. The
   question of how to use this capability in order to develop students'
   scientific ideas is still not solved and more research is argued for.

AB The aim of the present study is to explore the effects of
   Meta-strategic Knowledge (MSK) on scientific inquiry learning. MSK is a
   subcomponent of metacognition defined as general, explicit knowledge
   about thinking strategies. Following earlier studies that showed
   considerable effects of explicit instruction of MSK regarding the
   strategy of variables control, the present study explores whether
   similar effects are found in two additional scientific thinking
   strategies: Define Research Questions and Formulate Research
   Hypotheses. Participants were 119 eighth-grade students from six
   classes of a heterogeneous school. Equal numbers of low-achieving and
   high-achieving students were randomly assigned into experimental and
   control groups. The findings showed dramatic developments in students'
   performance following instruction. The effect of the treatment was
   preserved in a delayed transfer test. Our findings show that explicit
   teaching of MSK had a stronger effect for low-achieving students than
   for high-achieving students. The implications of the findings for
   teaching and learning in the context of scientific inquiry are
   discussed.

ID COMPREHENSION; MEMORY
AB The present theoretical paper presents a case for the use of narrative
   (i.e., fictional written text) in science education as a way of making
   science meaningful, relevant, and accessible to the public. Grounded in
   literature pointing to the value of narrative in supporting learning
   and the need to explore new modes of communicating science, this paper
   explores the potential of narrative in science education. More
   specifically, in this paper we explore the question: What is narrative
   and why might it be of value to science education? In answering this
   question we propose a view of narrative and its necessary components,
   which permits narrative a role in science education, and is, in fact,
   the main contribution of this paper. Also, a range of examples of
   narrative text are offered in the paper to make the case for a
   representation of fictional narrative in science. In order to address
   questions connected with the use of narrative in science education, a
   research agenda based on perspectives of narrative implications for
   learning is framed.

AB The present study explores the relationship between students' views of
   the nature of science (NOS) and their views of the nature of scientific
   measurement. A questionnaire with two-tier diagnostic multiple-choice
   items on both the NOS and measurement was administered to 179
   first-year physics students with diverse school experiences. Students'
   views on the NOS were classified into four NOS 'profiles', and views on
   measurement were classified according to either the point or set
   paradigms. The findings show that students with a NOS profile dominated
   by a belief that the laws of nature are to be discovered by scientists
   are more likely to have a view of the nature of scientific measurement
   characterised by a belief in 'true' values. On the other hand, students
   who believe that scientific theories are inventions of scientists,
   constructed from observations that are then validated through further
   experimentation, are more likely to have a view of the nature of
   scientific measurement that is underpinned by the uncertain nature of
   scientific evidence. The implications for teaching scientific
   measurement at tertiary level are discussed.

   students' creation and revision of accurate explanatory models

AB Understanding the particulate nature of matter (PNM) is vital for
   participating in many areas of science. We assessed 11 students'
   atomic/molecular-level explanations of real-world phenomena after their
   participation in a modelling-based PNM unit. All 11 students offered a
   scientifically acceptable model regarding atomic/molecular behaviour in
   non-heated solids. Yet, 10 of 11 students expressed the view that, in
   response to added heat energy, atoms/molecules in a solid increase in
   movement to a degree beyond what is scientifically accepted. These
   students attributed a gas-like model of atomic/molecular movement to
   situations involving a heated solid. Of the students who held two
   conflicting models of atomic/molecular movement in solids, almost all
   provided justification for doing so, indicating their holding of the
   conflicting models was unproblematic. These findings can be interpreted
   to mean that students may drop constraints of certain scientific
   representations and apply, assess, or revise models when explaining
   unfamiliar phenomena. In fact, we believe students may develop
   conflicting causal models as a result of misperceptions they acquire,
   in part, during classroom instruction regarding atomic/molecular
   movement. However, our findings may also be interpreted as an incidence
   of student model development that may later aid their understanding of
   a more complex model, one that involves substantial subatomic electron

TI Temperament Characteristics and Science Achievement: A longitudinal
   study of elementary students in Taiwan
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCHOOL; PREDICTION; ADD/WO
AB Based on data collected from 211 elementary school children in central
   Taiwan over four years, the role of temperament in science achievement
   was examined with multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) with
   repeated measures design. The results revealed that the students'
   science achievement is stable over time. The task orientation
   characteristics (i.e., distractibility, hyperactivity, and persistence)
   identified by previous research as important in mathematics and reading
   achievement are not consistent with the findings of this study that
   although the impacts of distractibility and persistence are
   significant, the simple effect of activity level on science achievement
   was not significant. However, the interaction effect of activity level
   and persistence is significant. Further break down analyses conducted
   to pursuit the interaction effect revealed that: (1) persistence has a
   consistent significant positive effects on all children over the years,
   except for the ones with high activity level (the upper 25th
   percentile); and (2) activity level has significant negative effects on
   high persistence (the upper 25th percentile) children only, and the
   interaction effect of activity level increases over time-the older the
   child the more significant the influence. Also, the tendency of
   approach/withdraw has significant impact on science achievement The
   educational implications of the findings include: (1) teachers of high
   activity students with high persistence may need to consider the match
   between children's interests and contents of instruction; (2) a good
   match between children's individual differences in distractibility,
   persistence, and approach need to be considered in contents,
   expectations, and interactions of the instruction.

TI Typical Didactical Activities in the Greek Early-Years Science
   Classroom: Do they promote science learning?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID EDUCATION; STUDENTS; CHILDREN
AB This paper presents an epistemological analysis of typical didactical
   activities noted in early-years science lessons, which was carried out
   in an attempt to diagnose the extent to which the teaching practices
   adopted by early-years educators are successful in supporting young
   children's understanding in science. The analysis of didactical
   activities used a framework that allowed us to discover whether they
   promoted desired connections between theoretical ideas, evidence and
   the material world. Theoretical ideas, evidence and the material world
   are entities internal to scientific inquiry and, in educational
   contexts, connections between them are considered essential in
   assisting the development of young children's scientific thinking. The
   results indicated that in the early-years science classroom scientific
   activity was mainly confined to the representational level.
   Intervention practices into the material world were limited, and were
   based on collected evidence. No interventions based on ideas were
   identified in the science lessons. Missing links between evidence and
   theory and between ideas and the material world suggest that the
   didactical activities analysed did not promote scientific understanding.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

AB While many researchers in science education have argued that students'
   epistemological understanding of models and of modelling processes
   would influence their cognitive processing oil a modelling task, there
   has been little direct evidence for such ail effect. Therefore, this
   studs, aimed to investigate the relation between students'
   epistemological understanding of models and modelling and their
   cognitive processing (i.e., deep versus surface processing) on a
   modelling task. Twenty-six students, working in dyads, were observed
   while working on a computer-based modelling task in the domain of
   physics. Students' epistemological understanding was assessed on four
   dimensions (i.e., nature of models, purposes of models, process of
   modelling, and evaluation of models). Students' cognitive processes
   were assessed based on their verbal protocols, using a coding scheme to
   classify their types of reasoning. The outcomes confirmed the expected
   positive correlation between students' level of epistemological
   understanding and their deep processing (r = 0.40, p = .04), and the
   negative correlation between level of epistemological understanding and
   surface processing (r = -0.51, p = .008). From these results, we
   emphasise the necessity of considering epistemological understanding in
   research as well as in educational practice.

TI Proportional Reasoning Ability and Concepts of Scale: Surface area to
   volume relationships in science
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CROSS-AGE; THINKING; CONSERVATION
AB The National Science Education Standards emphasise teaching unifying
   concepts and processes such as basic functions of living organisms, the
   living environment, and scale. Scale influences science processes and
   phenomena across the domains. One of the big ideas of scale is that of
   surface area to volume. This study explored whether or not there is a
   correlation between proportional reasoning ability and a student's
   ability to understand surface area to volume relationships. Students'
   knowledge of surface area to volume relationships was assessed pre and
   post to a one-week instructional intervention involving investigations
   about surface area to volume as a limiting factor in biological and
   physical systems. Results showed that proportional reasoning scores of
   middle school students were correlated to pre-test and post-test
   assessment scores, and a paired-sample t-test found significant
   differences from pre-test to post-test for the surface area to volume
   assessment. Relationships between proportional reasoning, visualisation
   abilities and success in solving surface to volume problems are
   discussed. The implications of the results of this study for learning
   concepts such as magnitudes of things, limits to size, and properties
   of systems that change depending on volume and surface are explored.

AB Decision making is influenced by multiple factors, especially when
   approaching controversial socioscientific issues, such as stem cell
   research. In the present study, we used qualitative data from 132
   college student papers in a biotechnology course to investigate how
   students made decisions about stem cell research issues. Students
   indicated their opinion about stem cell research topics and argued
   their stance using evidence they deemed relevant. We used NVivo7
   software to develop categories, code student responses, and run
   queries. We identified a continuum of positions that students took
   regarding the support or opposition of stem cell research, and we found
   students used eight different perspectives as lenses to form their
   decisions: medical application, ethical, rights, economic, religious,
   personal anecdotes, political, or scientific. The most common
   perspective was 'medical application'. Most students relied upon
   multiple perspectives when making their decisions. We found that when
   students used multiple viewpoints, the perspectives were unequally
   valued, generally relying more on ethical perspectives. Scientific
   perspectives were not common. These findings have implications for
   improving instruction by focusing the curriculum toward integrating
   scientific perspectives with non-scientific perspectives held.

AB This experimental study was designed to investigate whether supervision
   meetings, in which students receive specific advice on how to use a
   development portfolio to monitor their progress and plan their future
   learning, helps them to develop self-directed learning skills and
   improve their learning in the domain. In the first year of a
   hairdressing program in vocational education, supervision meetings were
   used to provide students with either specific advice or not. Students
   in the advice group (n = 21) formulated better learning needs, selected
   more suitable learning tasks, completed more practical assignments, and
   acquired more certificates than students in the feedback-only group (n
   = 22). Interviews also showed that students in the advice group
   appreciated the supervision meeting more and perceived them as more
   effective than students in the feedback-only group. Guidelines are
   provided for the use of development portfolios and the organization of
   supervision meetings in on-demand vocational education.

AB Video cases are becoming more and more prevalent throughout the United
   States to assist in the development and growth of preservice teachers'
   instruction. This research investigates the perspectives of preservice
   teachers and their na < ve understandings of the kinds of learning and
   assistance video cases can provide in their methodology courses.
   Personal Construct Theory was used to uncover participants' perceptions
   of their needs in terms of curriculum content of video cases.
   Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed six distinct clusters which
   serve as themes for discussing the early needs of preservice teachers
   and how video cases might be configured to address these perceived
   needs. Results reveal that preservice teachers' beliefs, though na <
   ve, do reflect the research on the actual needs of teachers in their
   first years of induction and support. Perhaps if preservice teachers'
   predilections are examined, this data can help guide the future
   implementation of video cases in their university courses.

   components: evaluation purpose, evaluation approach, measures for
   evaluation, and evaluation techniques. The findings suggest that it is
   inappropriate to conceptualize evaluation of such communities as a
   one-size-fits-all, generalizable measure of "good" or "bad." Instead,
   we recommend a comprehensive, on-going, diagnostic approach to
   measuring clusters of indicators, or syndromes, of a particular OLC and
   examining the causal relation assumed by the evaluators between what is
   measured and the success of OLC as an imputed outcome.

DE Aesthetics; Instructional design; Learning experience; Principles of

ID COGNITIVE LOAD THEORY; EDUCATION
AB This article offers principles that contribute to developing the
   aesthetics of instructional design. Rather than describing merely the
   surface qualities of things and events, the concept of aesthetics as
   applied here pertains to heightened, integral experience. Aesthetic
   experiences are those that are immersive, infused with meaning, and
   felt as coherent and complete. Any transformative learning experience
   will have significant aesthetic qualities, and all instructional
   situations can benefit from attention to these qualities. Drawn from
   aesthetics theory and research and informed by current ID and learning
   theories, a set of five first principles and twelve guidelines for
   their application are described. The principles are not only compatible
   with existing ID theory bases but can complement and support that
   theory by offering ways to embody it in engaging learning experiences.

AB The purpose of this randomized experiment was to compare the
   performance of high-, average-, and low-achieving middle school
   students who were assessed with parallel versions of a computer-based
   test (CBT) or a paper-pencil test (PPT). Tests delivered in
   interactive, immersive environments like the CBT may have the advantage
   of providing teachers with diagnostic tools that can lead to
   instruction tailored to the needs of students at different achievement
   levels. To test the feasibility of CBT, students were randomly assigned
   to the CBT or PPT test conditions to measure what they had learned from
   an instructional method called enhanced anchored math instruction. Both
   assessment methods showed that students benefited from instruction and
   differentiated students by achievement status. The navigation maps
   generated from the CBT revealed that the low-achieving students were
   able to navigate the test, spent about the same amount of time solving
   the subproblems as the more advanced students, and made use of the
   learning scaffolds.

AB This is a report of one case of a design and development research study
   that aimed to validate an overlay instructional design model
   incorporating the theory of multiple intelligences into instructional
   systems design. After design and expert review model validation, The
   Multiple Intelligence (MI) Design Model, used with an Instructional
   Systems Design (ISD) Model, was tested for use by four practicing
   instructional designers. Instruction developed for learners using this
   model was then evaluated measuring post-test and attitudinal scores
   with 102 participants. This report also provides a reflection on the
   lessons learned in conducting design and development research on model
   validation. The procedures and findings have implications for the
   processes involved in instructional design model validation through

DE Curriculum; Technology coordinator; Technology plan; School policy
ID INTEGRATION; ICT; INFORMATION; BELIEFS; SCALE
AB In this essay, we state that establishing technology curricula by
   national governments causes a shift in the policy actions of
   educational technology support: from a technical rationale with a main
   focus on funding and resources to a pedagogical rationale with a main
   focus on student competencies. We illustrate our point of view by
   describing the formal educational technology curriculum recently
   administered by the government in Flanders. This curriculum is written
   in terms of attainment targets and has clear implications on the nature
   of educational technology which is no longer dependent on teachers'
   individual efforts or willingness, but is becoming compulsory at the
   school level. Furthermore, we present two levers that facilitate the
   integration process of educational technology in general and the
   realization of technology curricula in particular. Technology
   coordinators should act more as curriculum managers and change agents,
   and schools should jointly establish a technology policy plan.

   characteristics of PhD students, incorporating communities of practice
   both during their studies and beyond completion of their PhD, and
   drawing on theories of adult learning and lifelong learning. It shows
   how professional discourse enhances academic discourse through student
   engagement in lifelong learning, and how PhD 'learners as field
   experts' turn into researchers beyond their PhD, influencing their
   environment and contributing to academic culture and society. We
   present these insights as a model of adult learning and professional

DE Doctorateness; threshold concepts; scholarly research; supervision;

AB Achieving a doctorate presents candidates with certain challenges -
   undertaking the research, writing the thesis and defending both at
   their viva. Throughout that doctoral journey, candidates are expected
   to display doctorateness in their thesis via the characteristics of
   high-quality scholarly research. The blockages that occur and prevent
   candidates progressing in their learning are portrayed as 'portals'
   whose threshold has to be passed over for real development to take
   place. Vignettes from candidates, supervisors and examiners provide
   insights on the notions of doctorateness and threshold concepts both in
   theory and in practice. Evidence shows that candidates who do not know
   what is expected of them may not have had the implications and
   technicalities of doctoral study adequately explained to them.

DE postgraduates; threshold concepts; conceptual thresholds; supervisors;

AB Much research into postgraduate student learning focuses on generic
   issues of research development. Early work, reported here, uses
   threshold concept theories and theories of conceptual threshold
   crossing to focus on the learning and supervisory support of
   postgraduates researching in the fields of literature and art. This
   paper is based on interviews with postgraduate students, postdoctorates
   and supervisors. It considers effective practices supporting
   postgraduate students and explores the reporting of experience, textual
   examples and dialogues to determine some of the characteristics in
   practice of both bringing threshold concepts into play in students'
   research and supporting their crossing of conceptual thresholds. We
   argue that identifying and working towards the overcoming of blockages
   or 'stuck places' in research can lead to conceptualised, critical and
   creative work in literature and art PhDs.

DE doctoral supervision; new academics; higher education
ID FACULTY; CAREER
AB This paper explores the experiences of new graduate supervisors,
   individuals who have just moved as it were from one side of 'the table'
   to the other. We describe how their learning to 'do supervision'
   relates to their understanding of academic work and how they make sense
   of the transition from doctoral student, someone supervised, to someone
   supervising, how they connect the past to the present (and future). The
   particular contribution is the examination of new academics' experience
   of supervision within the broader context of undertaking to establish
   oneself as an academic. This study is part of a broad research
   programme in Canada that investigates the experiences of doctoral
   students and the academic staff who support them and then works
   collaboratively with those in the units in which we are collecting data
   to ensure the findings can inform and support doctoral policies and
   pedagogies.

ID STUDENTS; ATTITUDES; ACHIEVEMENT
AB The purpose of the study was to describe the development and
   application of an instrument to identify various dimensions of the
   learning environment, as perceived by elementary and middle school
   students in Taiwan. The instrument, the New Constructivist Learning
   Environment Scales, includes four dimensions: attitude concerning
   instruction, interaction, scientific inquiry, and understanding. Data
   analysis indicates that the instrument developed in this study has
   satisfactory validity and reliability measures. Data from the New
   Constructivist Learning Environment Scales reveal three major findings:
   compared with the other aspects, scientific inquiry is the least
   frequent in both the elementary and middle school science classrooms in
   Taiwan; transitional deterioration regarding the science learning
   environments was found from elementary to middle schools in two
   areas-interaction and understanding; and multiple regression indicated
   that the students' attitudes were associated with the dimensions of
   understanding and interaction. Qualitative data analysis based on
   classroom observation and interviews of students and their science
   teachers confirm and enrich these findings.

AB Research indicates that student understanding is either confirmed or
   reformed when given opportunities to share what they know. This study
   was conducted to answer the research question: Will classroom dialogue
   facilitate students' understanding of lunar concepts related to
   geometric spatial visualisation? Ninety-two middle school students
   engaged in classroom discussion about the two-dimensional models of the
   Sun-Earth-Moon system they created at the end of an inquiry Moon unit.
   Their responses to selected questions of the Lunar Phases Concept
   Inventory were also analysed. Findings indicate that classroom
   discourse provides the optimal setting for students to deeply ponder
   their long-held misconceptions and reconstruct their understanding
   regarding the cause of lunar phases.

TI High-school Students' Conceptual Difficulties and Attempts at
   Conceptual Change: The case of basic quantum chemical concepts
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

DT Article
ID MENTAL MODELS; CHEMISTRY; SCIENCE; MISCONCEPTIONS; INSTRUCTION;
   MECHANICS; MOLECULES; PHYSICS; ATOMS
AB This study tested for deep understanding and critical thinking about
   basic quantum chemical concepts taught at 12th grade (age 17-18). Our
   aim was to achieve conceptual change in students. A quantitative study
   was conducted first (n = 125), and following this 23 selected students
   took part in semi-structured interviews either individually or in small
   groups that were allowed to interact under the coordination of the
   investigators. The planetary Bohr model was strongly favoured, while
   the probabilistic nature of the orbital concept was absent from many
   students' minds. Other students held a hybrid model. In some cases,
   students did not accept that the electron cloud provides a picture of
   the atom. Many students had not understood the fundamental nature of
   the uncertainty principle. Finally, the mathematical description of the
   formation of molecular orbitals caused problems in the case of
   destructive (antibonding) overlap of atomic orbitals. Our approach to
   conceptual change employed active and cooperative forms of learning,
   which are consistent with social-cultural constructivism and with
   Vygotsky's zone of proximal development. It proved effective in a
   number of cases, and ineffective in others. The variation in students'
   approaches was explained on the basis of Ausubel's theory about
   meaningful and rote learning and of the ability to employ higher-order
   cognitive skills. Nevertheless, the methodology used can be useful for
   all students, irrespective of their behaviour in traditional written
   examinations.

ID CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES; CLASSROOM PRACTICE; EDUCATION; BELIEFS;
   CURRICULUM; PERSPECTIVES; METHODOLOGY; TECHNOLOGY; STS
AB The need for the inclusion of socio-scientific issues (SSI) into
   science curricula has been generally accepted, but relatively few
   science teachers have incorporated SSI into their courses. Most science
   teachers feel that their most important task by far is to teach the
   principles of science, and any substantive pedagogical changes
   represent a burden. Reformers and researchers often point out science
   teachers' lukewarm reactions to the reforms as a major barrier for
   educational changes but pay little attention to teachers' deeper values
   and inspirations. However, there are some teachers who address SSI out
   of their own personal initiative. Detailed case studies of four such
   teachers showed that although the teachers were aware of Science,
   Technology, Society or other reform efforts, they developed their own
   thrust and materials for SSI based on their own values, ideals,
   philosophies and personal concerns. This suggests that the current
   curriculum reforms (Science, Technology, Society, SSI, and Nature of
   Science) tend to suggest theoretical ideals, but do not effectively
   connect with teachers' deeper values and ideals.

   knowledge (PCK) involving the topic 'ozone layer depletion'. An
   open-ended survey was first administered to 216 PSTs in their final
   year at the Faculty of Education to determine their subject matter
   knowledge of ozone layer depletion. Then, the PSTs were classified as
   high-ability, average-ability, and low-ability groups according to
   their scores on the survey. The interviews were carried out with 25
   randomly selected PSTs from each of these ability groups in order to
   determine their pedagogical knowledge and investigate the
   interrelationships and intra-relationships among the components of the
   PSTs' PCK for teaching the topic 'ozone layer depletion'. The results
   showed that there was a significant inter-relationship between the
   subject matter and pedagogical knowledge of the PSTs. There were also
   significant intra-relationships among the components of the PSTs'
   pedagogical knowledge, except for the knowledge of assessment. The
   results of statistical analyses (multivariate analyses of variance)
   revealed that there was a significant difference in the degree of the
   PSTs' pedagogical knowledge by the level of PSTs' subject matter
   knowledge, These significant results were further supported by evidence
   from qualitative analyses of the interview data. The implications drawn
   contribute to the improvement of science teacher education.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB The aim of the reported study was to explore how science teachers made
   sense of their roles and responsibilities in teaching and assessing
   science coursework. The focus was on the teacher assessment, the
   feedback that teachers gave to students and, how they perceived their
   role when they taught and assessed students' science coursework
   reports. The research methodology included observation of science
   lessons, collection of marked students' reports and two interviews with
   each of the nine participant teachers. Two cases of teachers are
   considered as representative of the participant teachers and their
   perceptions and practices are compared and contrasted. Teachers either
   adopted the role of the examiner or combined the role of the teacher
   with that of examiner. They distinguished marking of science theory
   exercises from marking of coursework and, teaching theory from teaching
   investigations, on the basis that the grade they assigned to coursework
   contributed to the total grade for external exams. A key conclusion is
   that teaching and assessment of science coursework need to re-focus on
   learning. The study calls for changes in public policy for summative
   assessment to place more reliance on teachers' assessments and
   secondly, for changes in school practices in formative assessment for
   teachers to support students to learn in the case of science coursework.

TI The Loss of Biodiversity as a Challenge for Sustainable Development:
   How Do Pupils in Chile and Germany Perceive Resource Dilemmas?
SO RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Education for sustainability; Biodiversity education; Subjective
   theory; Chile; Germany; Resource dilemmas
ID CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; STUDENTS; SCIENCE
AB The topic of biodiversity is of high value for education for
   sustainable development as it reflects the interaction of ecological,
   economic and social issues particularly well. Especially in so-called
   biodiversity hotspots, among them Chile, natural resources are often
   depleted for economic interest which, in many cases, is required
   income. Therefore, economic and social aspects must be considered in
   order to fully understand biodiversity loss. Being such an important
   issue, it is surprising that little is known thus far about learning
   prerequisites concerning biodiversity. This paper presents a
   qualitative interview study that investigated 16 to 18-year-old Chilean
   and German learners' perception of biodiversity and its loss (n = 24).
   Firstly, the pupils' cognitive frameworks were analysed. Secondly,
   subjective theories about biodiversity loss due to resource dilemmas
   were explored. Three subjective theories that emerged from the data
   reflected the notion that most pupils focused on either ecological or
   economic aspects of biodiversity loss. Pupils who concentrated on
   ecological aspects often referred to incorrect ecological facts.
   Moreover, these pupils showed difficulties in developing empathy and
   solidarity with impoverished people, who depend economically on plants
   in a resource dilemma. A smaller group of pupils succeeded in
   integrating the ecological, economic, and social aspects. Regarding the
   two samples, Chilean pupils seemed to have greater difficulties in
   recognising the social aspects of biodiversity loss, while German
   pupils were largely unaware of biodiversity loss on a local level.
   Implications for biodiversity education and future research will be
   outlined and discussed.

AB This study investigated the effect of metaconceptual teaching
   interventions on students' understanding of force and motion concepts.
   A multimethod research design including quasi-experimental design and
   case study designs was employed to compare the effect of the
   metaconceptual activities and traditional instruction and investigate
   students' reactions to metaconceptual teaching interventions. The
   participants (45 high school students in the USA) were enrolled in one
   of the two physics classes instructed by the same science teacher. In
   the experimental group, students' engagement in metaconceptual
   knowledge and processes was facilitated through various instructional
   activities, including poster drawing, journal writing, group debate,
   concept mapping, and class and group discussions. These activities were
   intended to facilitate students' engagement in (a) becoming aware of
   their existing and past conceptions, associated beliefs, everyday
   experiences, and contextual differences, (b) monitoring their
   understanding of the new conception, the changes in ideas, and the
   consistency between existing and new conceptions, and (c) evaluating
   the relative ability of competing conceptions to explain a physical
   phenomenon. In the comparison group, the same content knowledge was
   explained by the teacher along with the use of laboratory experiments,
   demonstrations, and quantitative problem solving. Students' reactions
   to the designed instructional activities indicated that metaconceptual
   teaching interventions were successful in facilitating students'
   engagement in several types of metaconceptual functioning. The results
   showed that students in the experimental group had significantly better
   conceptual understanding than their counterparts in the comparison
   group and this positive impact remained after a period of 9 weeks.

AB Interactivity, group learning and student engagement are accepted as
   key features of social constructivist learning theories. The challenge
   is to understand the interplay between such features in different
   learning environments. This study focused on the qualitative
   differences between two interventions-small-groups and whole-class
   discussions. In both interventions, three short video slices on the
   abstract topic 'the physics of superconductivity' were interspersed
   with the different discussion styles. The video slices are based on the
   Bruner stages. Twenty-nine first year university physics students
   completed a pre-test, underwent the intervention and completed a
   post-test. The remainder of the data were collected from student
   drawings, video recordings, observer notes and facilitator feedback.
   Results indicate that the use of the video slices in both interventions
   were successful in changing students' understandings of
   superconductivity. However, the small groups treatment tended to
   facilitate questioning, meaning-making and subsequent changes of ideas
   more so than the whole class discussions. Implications for research and
   practice are discussed.

AB In a series of three experimental studies, the effectiveness of
   three-dimensional computer simulations to aid the understanding of
   chemical structures and their properties was investigated. Arguments
   for the usefulness of three-dimensional simulations were derived from
   Mayer's generative theory of multimedia learning. Simulations might
   lead to a decrease in cognitive load and thus support active learning.
   In our studies, the learning effectiveness of three-dimensional
   simulations was compared to two-dimensional illustrations by use of
   different versions of a computer programme concerning the modifications
   of carbon. The first and third study with freshman students of
   chemistry and biochemistry show that no more knowledge was acquired
   when participants learnt with three-dimensional simulations than with
   two-dimensional figures. In the second study with 16-year old secondary
   school students, use of simulations facilitated the acquisition of
   conceptual knowledge. It was concluded that three-dimensional
   simulations are more effective for younger students who lack the
   experience of learning with different visual representation formats in
   chemistry. In all three studies, a significant relationship between
   spatial ability and conceptual knowledge about the modifications of
   carbon was detected.

AB As part of a project concerned with developing a better understanding
   of the detail of appropriate teaching of direct current (DC)
   electricity concepts, extensive individual interviews were conducted
   with a number of experienced senior high school physics teachers. These
   interviews explored teachers' perceptions of difficulties in student
   learning and their own teaching of DC electricity, their uses of models
   and analogies in this teaching, and their own understandings of the
   concepts of DC electricity. Eight high school physics teachers from the
   Australian state of Victoria were interviewed: three who had a strong
   focus on student understanding in their classrooms and five who used
   more traditional approaches. We also interviewed three authors of
   textbooks then currently used in senior high school physics in
   Victoria, all of whom were also teachers of high school physics. All
   but one of these eleven interviewees was a very experienced teacher of
   DC electricity at the senior high school level. The interview data are
   summarized and implications for curriculum and teaching/learning of
   electricity are considered. There was a wide range of views among the
   teachers about the difficulties of both the concepts of DC electricity
   and the teaching of these concepts, and about the nature of physics
   knowledge. A number of the interviewees revealed levels of conceptual
   understanding that we see as of concern. Some of the teachers whose
   understanding causes us concern made clear early in the interview their
   view that the concepts of DC electricity were essentially straight
   forward; in all cases these interviewees had by the end of the
   interview reconsidered this position.

AB This study described the process of developing and validating the
   College Chemistry Self-Efficacy Scale (CCSS) that can be used to assess
   college students' beliefs in their ability to perform essential tasks
   in chemistry. In the first phase, data collected from 363 college
   students provided evidence for the validity and reliability of the new
   scale. Three dimensions emerged: self-efficacy for cognitive skills,
   self-efficacy for psychomotor skills, and self-efficacy for everyday
   applications. In the second phase, data collected from an independent
   sample of 353 college students confirmed the factorial structure of the
   21-item CCSS. The Cronbach alpha coefficients ranged from 0.82 to 0.92.
   In addition, each dimension of the CCSS had moderate and significant
   correlations with student chemistry achievement and differentiated
   between major and non-major students. Followed by the additional
   validation studies, the CCSS will serve as a valuable tool for both
   instructors and researchers in science education to assess college
   students' chemistry self-efficacy beliefs.

ID AUTHENTIC SCIENCE; INQUIRY; TALK
AB Most academic science educators encourage teachers to provide their
   students with access to more authentic science activities. What can and
   do teachers say to increase students' interests in participating in
   opportunities to do real science? What are the discursive resources
   they draw on to introduce authentic science to students? The purpose of
   this ethnographic and discourse-analytic study is to investigate the
   ways in which the activities of scientists are discursively presented
   to high school students in a biology/career preparation course. Data
   sources were collected by means of observation, field notes,
   interviews, and videotaped lessons in an eleventh-grade biology/career
   preparation course. Drawing on discourse analysis, we investigate the
   discursive resources-or, more specifically and technically, the
   interpretative repertoires-teachers used to explain and promote
   opportunities to engage students in real science activities. Our
   analysis identifies and characterizes six types of interpretative
   repertoires: specialized, a-stereotypical, relevant, empirical,
   emotive, and rare-opportunity. To better understand the "big picture"
   of how these discursive resources are drawn on in the classroom, we
   also report on the frequencies of the repertoires in the discourse and
   the ways in which repertoires changed in the course of teacher-student
   interactions. The findings of this case study offer teachers and
   researchers with a better understanding of how specific forms of
   discourse-i.e., the repertoires-can serve as resources to enhance
   teacher-introduction of authentic science to students and provide
   students a bridge between school and authentic science.

AB This paper reports research from a three-year Australian science
   teacher professional learning project, the Science Teaching and
   Learning (STaL) Project, in which groups of science teacher
   participants (across years K - 12) worked with academics over a
   one-year period as teacher researchers. Through reflecting on their
   experiences within the STaL Project and collecting data from their
   classrooms related to specific science teaching concerns, teacher
   participants constructed cases around particular aspects of their
   professional learning. The cases that these participants developed
   elicited rich insights into their teaching and their students' learning
   of science. This paper discusses how the cases were developed by the
   teacher researcher participants and uses exemplars as a way of
   illustrating the nature of the professional knowledge developed.

AB We examine the respective roles of substantive understanding (i.e.,
   understanding of factual knowledge, concepts, laws and theories) and
   procedural understanding (an understanding of ideas about evidence;
   concepts such as reliability and validity, measurement and calibration,
   data collection, measurement error, the ability to interpret evidence
   and the like) required to carry out an open-ended science
   investigation. Our chosen method of analysis is Charles Ragin's Fuzzy
   Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis which we introduce in the paper.
   Comparing the performance of undergraduate students on two
   investigation tasks which differ with regard to the amount of
   substantive content, we demonstrate that both substantive understanding
   and an understanding of ideas about evidence are jointly involved in
   carrying out such tasks competently. It might be expected that
   substantive knowledge is less important when carrying out an
   investigation with little substantive demand. However, we find that the
   contribution of substantive understanding and an understanding of ideas
   about evidence is remarkably similar for both tasks. We discuss
   possible reasons for our findings.

AB Using mobile games in education combines situated and active learning
   with fun in a potentially excellent manner. The effects of a mobile
   city game called Frequency 1550, which was developed by The Waag
   Society to help pupils in their first year of secondary education
   playfully acquire historical knowledge of medieval Amsterdam, were
   investigated in terms of pupil engagement in the game, historical
   knowledge, and motivation for History in general and the topic of the
   Middle Ages in particular. A quasi-experimental design was used with
   458 pupils from 20 classes from five schools. The pupils in 10 of the
   classes played the mobile history game whereas the pupils in the other
   10 classes received a regular, project-based lesson series. The results
   showed those pupils who played the game to be engaged and to gain
   significantly more knowledge about medieval Amsterdam than those pupils
   who received regular project-based instruction. No significant
   differences were found between the two groups with respect to
   motivation for History or the Middle Ages. The impact of location-based
   technology and game-based learning on pupil knowledge and motivation
   are discussed along with suggestions for future research.

AB The possible benefits of agent expressiveness have been highlighted in
   previous literature; yet, the issue of verbal expressiveness has been
   left unexplored. I hypothesize that agent verbal expressiveness may
   improve the interaction between pedagogical agents and learners,
   ultimately enhancing learning outcomes. Evidence from a
   quasi-experimental investigation, indicates that learners who
   interacted with an expressive agent 1) scored higher on a post-task
   exam; and 2) rated the agent's ability to interact higher, than
   learners who interacted with a non-expressive agent. Qualitative
   results provided insight into this finding, while indicating the
   complexity of deploying pedagogical agents in educational settings.

   bridging

AB In the Singapore primary school Mathematics curriculum, students are
   taught the model method that uses bar diagrams to visualize the problem
   structure in a given word problem. When these students progress to
   secondary school, they learn the algebraic way of solving word
   problems. Studies (e.g. Ng et al.) have shown that poor bridging of
   students from the use of bar diagrams to the use of letter-symbolic
   algebraic methods can hinder their learning of algebra. We design a
   software tool 'ALGEBAR' to scaffold the learning of the algebraic
   process, especially the formulation of equations to support a pedagogy
   that seeks to help students transit from bar diagrams to algebraic
   methods. In this paper, we report a cycle of evaluation of the
   intervention pedagogy by examining a class that uses the software tool
   as part of a holistic intervention package. This evaluation is in the
   context of an overall design research approach that sought to address
   complex problems in real classroom contexts in collaboration with
   practitioners and to integrate design principles with technological
   affordances to render plausible solutions. Our findings show that the
   software tool can be an important enabler of the bridging process.

AB Digital teaching portfolios have been proposed as an effective tool for
   teacher learning and professional development, but there is a lack of
   empirical evidence supporting their effectiveness. This study proposed
   the design of a structured digital portfolio equipped with multiple
   aids (e.g. self-assessment, peer assessment, discussion and journal
   writing) for the professional development of teachers. This study also
   empirically evaluated the reflection and professional development as
   demonstrated in digital teaching portfolios with multiple supporting
   measures. Forty-four in-service substitute teachers participated in a
   course of classroom assessment and used a Web-based portfolio system.
   Based on the framework of teacher reflective thinking developed by
   Sparks-Langer et al., we found that most teachers demonstrated moderate
   levels of reflection in their journals but only one-third of them
   showed the highest level of reflection. We also found that the
   professional knowledge of teachers about classroom assessment - as
   shown by their implementation of it - improved significantly during the
   construction of portfolios. The above findings also represent good
   evidence that digital portfolios with multiple aids are beneficial to
   teacher reflection and professional development.

AB This paper reports on a qualitative study of students' engagement with
   a Web-based inquiry environment aimed at prompting student reflection
   in processes of scientific inquiry. In order to demonstrate how prompts
   become structuring resources for students' scientific inquiry, detailed
   analyses of students' interaction processes are conducted. The
   students' written responses to the reflection prompts indicated a
   widespread use of a 'copy and paste' strategy. The analyses of student
   interaction deepen this finding and show that instead of participating
   in reflection activities, the students make use of these 'copy and
   paste' strategies in order to come up with 'correct' answers to the
   prompts. Further, the analyses indicate that the students' employment
   of these strategies can be seen as a response to what can be termed the
   institutional practices of schooling embedded within the design of the
   prompts. These findings are discussed and explored in accordance with
   findings from previous studies on prompting students' reflection in
   Web-based inquiry environments. The study demonstrates the value of a
   socio-cultural perspective for gaining a deeper understanding of
   students' engagement with Web-based learning environments. Such a
   perspective can give valuable insight into how to (re)design prompts,
   and how prompts can be productive parts of students' learning.

AB Increased use of technology for instructional purposes has Caused some
   debates about ethical and/or moral use of computers. All teachers, as
   practitioners of ICT in learning settings, must feel responsible for
   educating students on "what is right and what is wrong?" of computer
   use. This study aimed to determine prospective teachers' unethical
   computer using behaviors at a faculty of education in Turkey. The
   results showed that the participating prospective teachers are
   sensitive to ethical computer use. However, the general mean of the
   surveys is above the average by a small degree that makes the
   participants' judgments of ethical use inconsiderable. it can be
   concluded that they undermine ethical computer use. Science teachers
   and computer education teachers' judgments were less ethical than those
   of classroom teachers and social sciences teachers. The results also
   revealed that female candidate teachers were more concerned about
   ethical issues and that prospective teachers who had up to five years
   of PC experience considered ethical computer use more than those with
   five years and beyond. After the survey analysis, the study was
   completed with qualitative data gathered from semi-structured
   interviews with nine students. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Women's under-representation in fields such as engineering may result
   in part from female students' negative beliefs regarding these fields
   and their low self-efficacy for these fields. In this experiment, we
   investigated the use of animated interface agents as social models for
   changing male and female middle-school students' attitudes toward
   engineering-related fields, their self-efficacy for these fields, and
   their math performance. Students interacted with either a female or a
   male computer-based agent or they did not interact with an agent. The
   female agent increased interest, utility beliefs, self-efficacy. and
   math performance compared to control and, for boys, decreased
   stereotyping. Mediational analyses indicated that the female agent
   facilitated interest and math performance by enhancing self-efficacy.
   The findings indicate that interface agents may be used effectively as
   social models for influencing attitudes and beliefs and supporting
   performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While past studies on user-interface design focused on a particular
   system or application using the experimental approach, we propose a
   theoretical model to assess the impact of perceived user-interface
   design (PUID) on continued usage intention (CUI) of self-paced
   e-learning tools in general. We argue that the impact of PUID is
   mediated by two variables, namely perceived functionality (PF) and
   perceived system support (PSS), which influence perceived usefulness
   (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU), respectively. We empirically
   validated the model using data collected from a survey administered to
   university students in Hong Kong. We found that most hypotheses are
   valid and PUID is an important antecedent of CUI of a self-paced
   e-learning tool. We also showed that PU and user satisfaction (USat)
   are two essential predictors of CUI. However, the impact of PEOU on CUI
   is indirect via PU as a mediator. Our findings enrich the theory on the
   continued usage of technology, and provide e-learning developers with
   managerial insights on how to entice learners to continue using their
   e-learning tools. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study with data collected from a large sample of freshmen in 2001
   and a random stratified sample of seniors in 2005 examined students
   perceived FITness (fluency with Information Technology). In the fall of
   2001 freshmen at a medium sized research-one institution completed a
   survey and in spring 2005 a random sample of graduating seniors
   completed a similar survey. The surveys measured the student's
   self-reported proficiency in basic information technology knowledge and
   skills such as word processing and presentation software as well as
   more complex applications such as digital audio. We found a significant
   increase in perception of skills in presentation software and browsers
   and although both groups reported low skill levels, a significant
   decrease in perception of skills in database, web animation,
   programming, desktop publishing, digital video, and video audio.
   Although one might assume an undergraduate would indicate an increase
   in information and communication technology skills, this study found
   that often student's perceptions of ability decline. However this
   decrease may be due to their increased awareness of the skills needed
   in the workforce. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study describes the results of a survey and a description of
   instructional technologies in place in the social sciences in South
   African Universities. Lecturers in the social sciences reported a
   well-established practice of information and communication technologies
   (ICTs) use for general purposes (although frequent use tended to be for
   email and searching the Internet). They had a high self-efficacy in
   terms of using ICTs both generally and for teaching and learning, and a
   high enthusiasm for the use of ICTs for teaching and learning. Half the
   lecturers had started using ICTs recently with the introduction of
   learning management systems (LMSs) whereas the other half had
   established practices that preceded the main-streaming of LMSs across
   universities. Only about a quarter of the respondents felt able to
   develop and update ICTs themselves which indicates that support is a
   necessary part of teaching with technology. in terms of different types
   of use the focus was on putting content on the web and course
   administration. Use of ICTs for teaching of skills (whether information
   literacy, problem solving or critical thinking) was infrequent. There
   were different types of ICT use across the different sub-disciplines.
   Lecturers reported factors which constrained their use of ICTs for
   teaching and learning, such as inadequate technology, pedagogical
   issues (e.g. plagiarism), and students opting out of lectures when
   materials were available online. It is argued that user studies in are
   relevant to the future delivery of educational material, in terms of
   removing barriers to use and targeting training and supportive
   activities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID COLLABORATIVE DISCOVERY; COMPUTER-SIMULATIONS; DESIGN
AB Modeling offers a promising form of constructivist learning for
   students. By making and executing models of dynamic systems in a
   computer environment, students are stimulated to learn about the
   specific domain that is modeled as well as about the process of
   modeling in general. However, learning by modeling also leads to
   characteristic student mistakes, based on a combination of faulty
   domain knowledge and insufficient modeling skills. In this article, we
   describe a method of generating advice to students during their
   modeling process. The on-line advice system was informed by our
   observations of a teacher who gave advice via a textual communication
   tool to students building models with a System Dynamics model editor.
   The first version of the on-line advice system was evaluated in two
   ways: first, three teachers evaluated the advice the system generated
   for students' final solutions; second, we analyzed the advice the
   system provided as it was used by a sample of students who were
   building a physics model. These evaluations showed that the overall
   approach, including matching a student solution to a family of
   reference solutions together with the other mechanisms of the advice
   system, is valid. However, they also highlighted the difficulty of
   building 'intelligent' support to help students to improve their models
   and gain modeling expertise. The article concludes with a discussion of
   our current efforts to improve the advice system based on the lessons
   learnt, which suggest extension of the range of solution
   representations and of the operations of the advice method. (C) 2009

AB This study focuses on carrying out weighted digraph-based mathematical
   construction of hypermedia and user navigation on hypermedia and making
   a presentation of "weighted" forms of known stratum and compactness. In
   the instructional Web design researches, the structural analysis of
   navigation on the hypermedia is important in modeling the behaviors
   that the learners perform while using this kind of media. Therefore,
   new conceptions of the presented usage of new measures towards this
   goal are also discussed within the scope of our study. (C) 2009

AB The rapid development of computer and network technologies has
   attracted researchers to investigate strategies for and the effects of
   applying information technologies in learning activities;
   simultaneously, learning environments have been developed to record the
   learning portfolios of students seeking web information for
   problem-solving. Although previous research has demonstrated the
   benefits of applying information technologies to learning activities,
   the difficulties in doing so have also been revealed. One of the major
   difficulties is the lack of a mechanism to assist teachers in
   evaluating the problem-solving ability of the students, such that
   constructive suggestions can be given to the Students, and tutoring
   strategies can be improved accordingly.
   To cope with this problem, in this paper, an auto-scoring mechanism is
   developed to analyze the various information searching abilities of
   individual students. Indicators of information searching ability (ISA)
   are proposed based on the famous Big6 model and are adopted in our
   auto-scoring mechanism. Moreover, two experiments have been conducted
   to demonstrate the effectiveness of this innovative approach. The
   experimental results show high correlation between the scores of the
   auto-scoring mechanism and the manual scoring. Moreover, the feedbacks
   from 158 teachers also show that the innovative approach is highly
   accepted by the teachers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the growing demand in e-learning, numerous research works have
   been done to enhance teaching quality in e-learning environments. Among
   these studies, researchers have indicated that adaptive learning is a
   critical requirement for promoting the learning performance of
   students. Adaptive learning provides adaptive learning materials,
   learning strategies and/or courses according to a student's learning
   style. Hence, the first step for achieving adaptive learning
   environments is to identify students' learning styles. This paper
   proposes a learning style classification mechanism to classify and then
   identify students' learning styles. The proposed mechanism improves
   k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classification and combines it with genetic
   algorithms (GA). To demonstrate the viability of the proposed
   mechanism, the proposed mechanism is implemented on an open-learning
   management system. The learning behavioral features of 117 elementary
   school students are collected and then classified by the proposed
   mechanism. The experimental results indicate that the proposed
   classification mechanism can effectively classify and identify
   Students' learning styles. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a description and evaluation of Myartspace, a
   service on mobile phones for inquiry-led learning that allows students
   to gather information during a school field trip which is automatically
   sent to a website where they can view, share and present it, back in
   the classroom or at home.
   The evaluation focused on three levels: a micro level, concerned with
   issues of usability; a meso level, which examined educational
   effectiveness in terms of learning breakthroughs and breakdowns; and a
   macro level, which looked at the impact of the new technology on school
   museum visits practice. Issues of implementing mobile learning across
   school and museum settings are identified and cross-level influences
   are discussed.
   The study showed that the service was effective in enabling students to
   gather information in a museum and this provided resources for
   effective construction and reflection in the classroom. Minor usability
   problems did not detract from the learning, however there are
   significant issues concerning how to structure the visit and on the
   viability of Myartspace as a regular service. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

   different faculty response while training faculty for
   technology-enhanced teaching at Butler University. During a technology
   upgrade of classrooms on our campus, we installed SMART(TM) interactive
   whiteboards and Sympodiums(TM) (SMART Technologies), visual presenters
   and CopyCams(TM) (Polyvision/Steelcase). The technology trainers and
   information technology (IT) department anticipated a lack of faculty
   interest in training on these technologies. It was posited that faculty
   would not be interested in learning about these interactive and
   presentation technologies unless this learning could be connected in
   some way to their individual teaching interests and responsibilities. A
   novel, collaborative training model was developed to achieve this goal
   of placing technology training into a pedagogical context. A
   multidisciplinary group of faculty, working closely with
   representatives from IR, served as trainers for this highly successful
   faculty development effort in which 27% of the university faculty were
   trained over a three month period. This article details the methods and
   outcomes of this collaborative training team approach. (C) 2009

AB The purposes of this study are to investigate fifth-graders' attitudes
   toward the Internet based on the 5-T framework (Tool, Toy, Telephone,
   Territory, and Treasure of Information), and to understand whether
   gender makes any difference in their attitudes. The data were obtained
   from 2,253 Taiwan fifth-grade students. Through a confirmatory factor
   analysis, the 5-T model was validated and can be used to explain the
   corresponding five-factors which constitute Internet attitudes.
   According to the results, the students perceived the Internet mainly as
   a useful and powerful tool for their academic work and daily lives.
   Moreover, students strongly considered the Internet a toy, which is
   somewhat indistinguishable from the role of Tool. The students
   acknowledged the role of the Territory that they can demonstrate
   themselves by writing and sharing personal information online.
   Therefore, the Internet is good for both reading and writing
   information. The least weighted factor among 5-Ts student recognized is
   the role of Telephone. Gender differences exist in the subscales of
   Tool, Toy, Treasure of Information, and Telephone, but not in the
   Territory subscale of the Internet attitudes scale. This study further
   discusses and presents implications of the findings for teachers,
   parents, and future studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Enactive role play; Argumentation; Second Life; Epistemic activities
AB This paper examines how pre-university students shared and constructed
   knowledge in the context of GP (general paper) by interacting through
   individual virtual characters across five cycles of enactive role play
   sessions. Contextualized scenarios on the topic of euthanasia were
   developed in Second Life. Role-playing the virtual characters through
   three-dimensional avatars, 45 Students from two different classes
   grappled and dealt with issues related to euthanasia such as ethics,
   morality. and religion. The enactment log transcripts of 10 student
   groups across five enactment sessions were analyzed using an adapted
   collaborative argumentation framework. We present the results from two
   types of data analysis: a macro quantitative analysis of students'
   enactment log transcripts and a qualitative analysis of their
   open-ended responses. Our quantitative analysis at the class level
   revealed salient differences in the nature of epistemic interactions,
   the patterns of argumentative moves, and the patterns of social
   interactions between students from two classes. The findings from the
   qualitative analysis of students' open-ended responses indicate that
   students valued the embodied experience afforded by the immersive
   virtual environment. We discuss the findings of our research in terms
   of important pedagogical implications and the factors that influence
   argumentative knowledge sharing and constructing activities. (C) 2009

AB Graphing is a key skill in the study of Physics. Drawing and
   interpreting graphs play a key role in the understanding of science,
   while the lack of these has proved to be a handicap and a limiting
   factor in the learning of scientific concepts. It has been observed
   that despite the amount of previous graph-working experience, students
   of all ages experience a series of difficulties when trying to
   comprehend graphs or when trying to relate them with physical concepts
   such as position, velocity and acceleration. Several computational
   tools have risen to improve the students' understanding of kinematical
   graphs; however, these approaches fail to develop graph construction
   skills. On the other hand, Robots have opened new opportunities in
   learning. Nevertheless, most of their educational applications focus on
   Robotics related subjects, such as robot programming, robot
   construction, and artificial intelligence. This paper describes a
   robotic activity based on face-to-face computer supported collaborative
   learning. By means of a set of handhelds and a robot wirelessly
   interconnected, the aim of the activity is to develop graph
   construction and graph interpretation skills while also reinforcing
   kinematics concepts. Results show that students using the robotic
   activity achieve a significant increase in their graph interpreting
   skills. Moreover, when compared with a similar computer-simulated
   activity, it proved to be almost twice as effective. Finally, the
   robotic application proved to be a highly motivating activity for the
   students, fostering collaboration among them. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper looks at the ICT (information and communication technology)
   curriculum in New Zealand secondary schools and gendered participation
   patterns in different specialist ICT subjects. New Zealand has a
   permissive ICT curriculum, comprising a variety of subjects and
   characterised by choice and variation in the curriculum in practice at
   the local level. The data that are reported include results of (i) a
   national questionnaire survey of secondary schools, and (ii) a
   qualitative case study conducted in a large, co-educational New Zealand
   secondary school and involving classroom observations and interviews
   with teachers and students. It is suggested that the permissiveness of
   the curriculum, which ostensibly caters for the needs of students by
   providing choices, may, in some circumstances, effectively reinforce
   gender stereotypes relating to computer interests and practices. This
   is a paradox of choice. Questions are raised about the nature of the
   ICT curriculum in New Zealand and how it may contribute to or challenge
   gender stereotypes, future curriculum developments and, more broadly,
   how we can account for persistent gendered participation patterns in
   ICT subjects in schools. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Cooperative/collaborative learning
AB A desirable characteristic for an e-learning system is to provide the
   learner the most appropriate information based on his requirements and
   preferences. This can be achieved by capturing and utilizing the
   learner model. Learner models can be extracted based on personality
   factors like learning styles, behavioral factors like user's browsing
   history and knowledge factors like user's prior knowledge. In this
   paper, we address the problem of extracting the learner model based on
   Felder-Silverman learning style model. The target learners in this
   problem are the ones studying basic science. Using NBTree
   classification algorithm in conjunction with Binary Relevance
   classifier, the learners are classified based on their interests. Then,
   learners' learning styles are detected using these classification
   results. Experimental results are also conducted to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed automated learner modeling approach. The
   results show that the match ratio between the obtained learner's
   learning style using the proposed learner model and those obtained by
   the questionnaires traditionally used for learning style assessment is
   consistent for most of the dimensions of Felder-Silverman learning
   style. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,

ID INTERACTIVE WHITEBOARDS; TECHNOLOGIES; INFORMATION; TURKEY
AB The amount of investment that has been made in interactive whiteboards
   (IWB) in the Turkish educational system during the past several years
   is quite striking. This investment is part of a plan to integrate
   information and communication technologies (ICT) into the Turkish
   educational system, with the goal of increasing the qualitative and
   quantitative aspects of schooling. Prior to IWB investments, hundreds
   of thousands of computers, projectors, and printers were distributed to
   schools in efforts to raise a generation able to respond to the demands
   of the 21st century. In addition, 98% of secondary school students and
   93% of primary school students were provided with Internet access via
   ADSL. The aim of this study is to analyze the emerging trend of smart
   board investment in Turkish primary and secondary schools, with
   consideration of problems that hinder the effective use of IWBs in
   classrooms as compared to previous ICT integration efforts by the
   Ministry of National Education. The research is designed as an
   evaluative case study. The required data are collected through online
   questionnaires, teacher and pupil interviews, and document searches
   from teachers and students from various Turkish primary and secondary
   schools. It is not surprising that the factors hindering the use of
   IWBs in education are similar to the inhibiting factors in previous ICT
   integration projects. The findings show that when the needs for
   in-service training, digital education materials, support, maintenance,
   and administration are not addressed, educational ICT is unlikely to
   deliver the expected results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The use of computers to deliver course-related materials is rapidly
   expanding in most universities. Yet the effects of computer vs. printed
   delivery modes on students' performance and motivation are not yet
   fully known. We compared the impacts of Web vs. paper to deliver
   practice quizzes that require information search in lecture notes.
   Hundred and twenty two undergraduate students used either a web site or
   printed documents to answer 18 mathematics questions during a tutored
   session. A revised Web site was designed based on ergonomic criteria,
   to test the hypothesis that improved usability would decrease time
   spent on the task, the number of pages consulted, and students'
   perceived cognitive load. The group working with printed documents had
   the highest performance. Furthermore, students perceived the paper
   materials as less effortful to read, and expressed preference for
   printing lecture notes and questions. However, students appreciated
   having a Web site available. No differences were found between the two
   sites. We conclude that Web delivery imposed higher perceived cognitive
   load due to the need to read lengthy documents. We suggest possible
   ways to improve Web-based practice materials, such as simultaneous
   display of questions and lecture notes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The literature has frequently highlighted the usefulness of podcasting
   in higher education; however, there is an important gap between the
   theory on good practice in higher education and empirical studies about
   podcasting. With this in mind, we carried out an empirical study on an
   undergraduate degree course in Information Systems Management. The
   study consisted of the creation and broadcast of 13 podcasts,
   distributed over four months in which ninety distance students took
   part. The analysis follows the suggestions proposed in previous
   literature about the evaluation of technologies in a university
   learning environment. The findings, discussed within the framework of
   principles for good practice in higher education, suggest some
   interesting issues in distance courses, such as: (I) podcasting is a
   powerful tool as a complement to the traditional resources on a course,
   but not a substitute for them: (2) the characteristics of podcasting
   increase the impression of permanent contact between students and
   teachers, increasing students' motivation; (3) the use of podcasting
   allows for a diverse range of student skills and learning methods.
   Other secondary findings are discussed and some suggestions for future
   research are proposed at the end of this paper. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Exchange is a collaborative learning application, originally developed
   for wirelessly interconnected Pocket PCs, that provides support for
   students and a teacher performing a face-to-face computer supported
   collaborative learning (CSCL) activity in a Single Input/Single Display
   (SISD) mode. We extend the application to support a single display
   groupware (SDG) mode. In this new version, named Exchange-MM, three
   users each with their own mouse (Multiple Mice) interact on a single
   display with mediation by a technological network. The original
   collaborative interaction is maintained. We describe a collaborative
   learning activity and the software architecture that supports both
   interaction modes, and also present a usability analysis of the
   activity conducted with second-grade schoolchildren. The results show
   that as in SISD mode, in SDG with Multiple Mice (MM) the technological
   network improves communication, negotiation, interactivity,
   coordination and appropriability between members of collaborative
   learning groups. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Context-aware ubiquitous learning (u-learning) is an innovative
   approach that integrates wireless, mobile, and context-awareness
   technologies to detect the situation of learners in the real world and
   provide adaptive support or guidance accordingly. In this paper, a
   context-aware u-learning environment is developed for guiding
   inexperienced researchers to practice single-crystal X-ray diffraction
   operations. Experimental results showed that the benefits of this
   innovative approach are that it is "systematic", "authentic", and
   "economical", which implies the potential of applying it to complex
   science experiments, such as physics, chemistry or biotechnology
   experiments, for graduate and PhD students in colleges, or research
   workers in research institutes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Here we test if playing video-games require intelligence. Twenty-seven
   university undergraduate students were trained on three games from Big
   Brain Academy (Wii): Calculus, Backward Memory and Train. Participants
   did not have any previous experience with these games. General
   intelligence was measured by five ability tests before the training
   session. Training comprised 10 blocks of trials (10 trials per block).

   acquisition. In P. L. Ackerman, R. J. Sernberg, & R. Glaser (Eds.),
   Learning and individual differences: Advances in theory and practice
   (pp. 165-217). New York: W.H. Freeman and Company) theory of skill
   learning was used as a framework for the present study. Results show
   that playing the Train game increases the correlation with general
   intelligence across blocks of trials. This is not the case for Calculus
   and Backward Memory. These findings suggest strategies for designing
   video-games presumably appropriate to stimulate our core cognitive
   abilities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The information technology (IT) of today forms an integral part of
   everyday living, thus the nurture of children's IT awareness early in
   life is crucial. Young children have an innate curiosity for IT which
   suggests that in the school environment it can easily be integrated
   with other subjects in thematic and interdisciplinary curriculum. This
   quasi-experimental study used the Technology Foundation Standards for
   Students of the International Society for Technology in Education
   (ISTE) project on National Educational Technology Standards (NETS) as
   the basis to design a thematic and interdisciplinary IT curriculum for
   elementary students. A total of 1273 elementary students and 12
   computer teachers were separated into either a control or experimental
   group. After one academic year, students' final scores in English,
   mathematics, science, social studies, and art were gathered and
   compared. Statistical analysis indicated that there were significant
   differences in the experimental group's academic scores. Findings also
   suggested that an interdisciplinary curriculum design opened
   opportunity for collaborative work and cohesiveness among faculty.
   Further longitudinal studies are recommended to examine the long-term
   implications of a thematic and interdisciplinary IT curriculum design.

TI Evaluating college students' evaluations of a professor's teaching
   effectiveness across time and instruction mode (online vs.
   face-to-face) using a multilevel growth modeling approach

AB Aims: Do college students' ratings of a professor's teaching
   effectiveness suggest that a professor's teaching improves with time?
   Does anything predict which instructors receive the highest ratings or
   improve the fastest? And, importantly, do the correlates of change
   differ across face-to-face and online courses?
   Methods: I used data from 10,392 classes taught by 1120 instructors
   across three years and fit a taxonomy of multilevel growth models to
   examine whether students' ratings of teaching effectiveness (SETEs)
   changed across time, whether differences in average SETEs correlated
   with growth, and whether online vs. face-to-face, tenure, discipline,
   course level, sex, or minority status affected these estimates.
   Results: SETEs remained relatively stable across time and teachers,
   although analyses uncovered a statistically significant, negative
   correlation between initial status and growth. Instructors starting
   with lower SETEs improved the fastest. These findings held across
   online and face-to-face instruction modes. However, in face-to-face
   classes, minority instructors received significantly lower average
   SETEs. This difference did not occur in online classes. No other
   predictors showed statistically significant effects. Finally,
   considerable SETE variance remained unexplained even when including the
   full predictor set in the model.
   Discussion: These findings reveal that professors' SETEs can improve.
   Additionally, they indicate that patterns of change in teaching
   effectiveness do not differ generally across online and face-to-face
   instruction modes. However, the results showed that minority teachers
   in face-to-face but not online classes received lower evaluations than
   their majority counterparts. Additional research should seek to
   understand what leads to SETE differences across minority and majority
   groups in face-to-face classes but not online classes. (C) 2009

AB Color coding has been proposed to promote more effective learning.
   However, insufficient evidence currently exists to show how color
   coding leads to better learning. The goal of this study was to
   investigate the underlying cause of the color coding effect by
   utilizing eye movement data. Fifty-two participants studied either a
   color-coded or conventional format of multimedia instruction. Eye
   movement data were collected during the study. The results indicate
   that color coding increased retention and transfer performance.
   Enhancement of learning by color coding was due to efficiency of
   locating corresponding information between illustration and text. Color
   coding also attracted attention of learners to perceptually salient
   information. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate Turkish pre-service
   science and mathematics teachers' computer self-efficacies (CSEs) and
   computer attitude (CA) considering gender, year in program, and
   computer ownership as independent variables. Additionally the study
   aimed to examine the relationship between CSE and CA. Computer
   Self-efficacy Scale (CSES) and Computer Attitude Scale (CAS) were
   administered to 605 freshmen and senior teacher candidates. Descriptive
   results indicated that overall pre-service teachers had relatively high
   scores on both scales. Multivariate analysis of variance showed that a
   participant's gender was not a significant factor on his/her CSE and CA
   scores except for the computer liking sub-scale of the CAS. Seniors had
   higher scores than freshmen in the CSES and in the confidence dimension
   of the CAS. Those participants who owned computers had significantly
   higher scores on the CSES and CAS as compared to those who did not own
   a computer. A significant three-way interaction was found among the
   three independent variables, namely gender, major of study and computer
   ownership. Finally, correlational analysis showed that participants'
   CSES scores related to sub-scale scores of the CAS at varying degrees.

AB The paper reports data from an on-line peer tutoring project. In the
   project 78, 9-12-year-old students from Scotland and Catalonia peer
   tutored each other in English and Spanish via a managed on-line
   environment. Significant gains in first language (Catalonian pupils)
   modern language (Scottish pupils) and attitudes towards modern
   languages (both Catalonian and Scottish pupils) were reported for the
   experimental group as compared to the control group. Results indicated
   that pupils tutored each other in using Piagetian techniques of error
   correction during the project. Error correction provided by tutors to
   tutees focussed on morph syntaxys, more specifically the correction of
   verbs. Peer support provided via the online environment was
   predominantly based on the tutor giving the right answer to the tutee.
   High rates of impact on tutee corrected messages were observed. The
   implications for peer tutoring initiative taking place via on-line
   environments are discussed. Implications for policy and practice are
   explored. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study developed an instrument to evaluate student online
   information searching strategies based on a framework comprising three
   domains and seven aspects. Two versions of the Online Information
   Searching Strategies Inventory (OISSI), including both quick and
   complete versions, were finally established and exhibited good
   validities and reliabilities. The quick OISSI included 13 items and the
   complete OISSI included 25 items and the pair had total reliabilities
   of 0.85 and 0.91, respectively. This instrument provides researchers a
   valid and reliable tool to evaluate students' self-reflected web search
   strategies. The OISSI scores of 324 high school students revealed a
   significant gender difference in both behavioral and procedural domain
   strategies; however, no significant difference was observed in
   metacognitive domain strategies. In addition, student weekly online
   searching hours were found to significantly impact only behavioral
   domain strategies but not other domain strategies, implying that
   increasing student search experience may be insufficient to lift their
   search strategy. This study suggested several future study directions.

AB In constructivist principles, learning is a process in which
   individuals construct knowledge. Research in Mathematics Education
   looks for ways to make mathematics education less dry and more
   attractive. When solving polynomial equations of the first degree, it
   is very common for teachers to work with the mistaken idea of "changing
   the sign" when "moving" the member. To minimize this problem, a balance
   can be used to illustrate the idea of equilibrium and also properties
   of equality. The objectives of this study were (1) develop a
   computational tool to replace a conventional balance in practical
   mathematics exercises thereby solving two material challenges for
   Brazilian teachers: verifying the accuracy of balances and the lack of
   student physical and social activity through direct participation; (2)
   determine how substituting the conventional balance with a
   computational tool for the solution of first degree polynomial
   equations affected the aspects inherent in the learning process like
   motivation, cooperation, dialogue, discussion, reflection, reciprocity,
   negotiation and responsibility. The results indicate that the cognitive
   computational tool met the challenges of Brazilian teachers. First,
   because it lacks mechanisms that need to be verified for accuracy in
   order to demonstrate equilibrium. Second, because it allows the direct
   participation of students (physical experience) and the use of the tool
   in small groups (social experience). The hands on completion of the
   activity, realistic appearance, the interaction with the tool, visual
   feedback on the panel, and two students using the same tool awakened
   motivation, responsibility for completing the activity, dialogue,
   cooperation, discussion and reflection. Doing the experiment with
   others aroused concern about the learning of others and reciprocity of
   knowledge for the improvement of the procedure to be constructed for
   solving 1st degree equations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The explanation of certain 3D concepts is based on 2D drawings. These
   drawings should contain certain depth cues, such as perspective and
   overlapping. Until recently, parallax has not been used as a depth cue.
   Nevertheless, new technologies allow it to be incorporated. This forms
   the background to our study of the design of interactive educational
   resources and stereoscopic graphics. The results obtained demonstrate
   that (1) the use of parallax cues improves the interpretation of the
   figures and (2) that the assistance they afford is most appreciated by
   the students with less highly developed spatial perception. (C) 2009

AB Teachers' knowledge of computer-related ergonomics in education will
   have an effect on the learning process and the work practices of their
   students. However little is known about teacher education in this area.
   The study aimed to investigate the sources and nature of secondary
   school teachers' education about computer-related ergonomics. It also
   investigated the use of computers by secondary school children. The
   study included all secondary schools in the Republic of Ireland. The
   findings suggest that computers are widely available and are used
   frequently by students and teachers. However, there is evidence that
   teachers are not receiving information on computer-related ergonomics.
   Teachers were generally dissatisfied with this and would welcome
   information on the subject. The study discusses the implications of the
   findings and makes recommendations to meet the needs of the teachers.

AB The Internet is increasingly being used as a tool for communicating and
   learning in primary schools across many developed and developing
   countries. The place of social chat as part of online interactions has
   as yet not been fully recognised as an important component of learning.
   In this paper, the interactions of students in a Sydney primary school
   are examined focusing on the role that social chat plays as part of the
   online learning process. Here it is found that social chat allows for
   the development of related skills and knowledge and is an important
   precursor to more formal learning opportunities and as such, should be
   considered as an important part of the learning process. Such a
   consideration has implications for the way the curriculum is designed,
   implemented and assessed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB University courses about computer programming usually seek to provide
   students not only with technical knowledge, but also with the skills
   required to work in real-life software projects. Nowadays, the
   development of software applications requires the coordinated efforts
   of the members of one or more teams. Therefore, it is important for
   software professionals to master the sort of skills that assure the
   success of teamwork, such as communication, leadership, negotiation, or
   team management. However, these abilities are difficult to teach, one
   of the reasons being that they require true commitment from the
   students. However, today students are taking a more and more passive
   role in their own education, two of the more evident consequences being
   the increase in dropout rates and the decrease in marks obtained in
   exams. The NUCLEO e-learning framework has been designed to promote the
   effective acquisition of teamwork skills and, at the same time, to
   promote the more active participation of the students in their own
   learning process. NUCLEO adopts a socio-constructivist pedagogical
   approach that pursues the development of communities of practice for
   Problem Based Learning. Our research has rooted the design decisions of
   NUCLEO in the analysis of its socio-cultural environment with Activity
   Theory, which considers conflicts within groups as the impetus of their
   evolution and the forges of their environments. This paper presents the
   analysis of the main features of NUCLEO according to Activity Theory,
   as well as the experimental results obtained with the framework in
   three different case studies in university courses. (C) 2009 Elsevier

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of
   audio-visual synchrony in podcasting and its possible pedagogical
   benefits. 'Synchrony' in this study refers to the simultaneous playback
   of audio and video data streams, so that the transitions between
   presentation slides occur at "lecturer chosen" points in the audio
   commentary. Manufacturers of lecture recording software (e.g. ProfCast)
   would have us believe that the synchrony of image and audio should
   improve the learning experience. We have yet to see in the literature
   any empirical evidence to support this hypothesis. In our study, 90
   participants in two groups undertook two electronic lectures
   (e-lectures) on two separate topics, the subject matter of neither was
   familiar to them beforehand. Each group experienced one "synchronous"
   presentation (electure) of one of the topics, and one "separate"
   presentation (i.e. PowerPoint and audio files separately presented) of
   the other topic. Each group therefore experienced both "synchronous"
   and "separate" delivery and they were then given an MCQ test that
   assessed five levels of Bloom's taxonomy. Results show no differences
   in innate ability between the two groups but the evidence supported our
   primary hypothesis in that statistically significantly higher test
   scores were seen when participants viewed a synchronous electure: these
   scores were accounted for by subjects' performance at three of the five
   levels of Bloom's taxonomy. Qualitative 'attitude' survey results also
   displayed participant preference towards the synchronous over the
   asynchronous mode of delivery, and in spite of general acceptance of
   the proposed benefits of electronic proceedings, a majority preference
   towards traditional rather than electronic lectures. Despite this
   conservatism, this paper explores in more detail the potential benefits
   of podcasting via synchronous PowerPoint and voice. (C) 2009 Elsevier

TI On the Concept of Energy: How Understanding its History can Improve

SO SCIENCE & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID ALTERNATIVE APPROACH
AB Some physicists have pointed out that we do not know what energy is.
   Many studies have shown that the concept of energy is a problem for
   teaching. A study of the history of the concept shows that the
   discoverers of energy did not find anything which is indestructible and
   transformable but rather that the concept of energy underwent a change
   of meaning and energy was considered a substance towards the end of the
   nineteenth century. In distinguishing between the treatment of
   phenomena and the theories carried out by Mayer and Joule, it can be
   concluded that they established equivalences between different domains,
   such as motion and heat, motion and electricity or position and motion.
   This complies with the interpretation presented in textbooks published
   about a century ago and enables us to overcome some difficulties with
   the concept of energy.

AB A key focus of current science education reforms involves developing
   inquiry-based learning materials. However, without an understanding of
   how working scientists actually do science, such learning materials
   cannot be properly developed. Until now, research on scientific
   reasoning has focused on cognitive studies of individual scientific
   fields. However, the question remains as to whether scientists in
   different fields fundamentally rely on different methodologies.
   Although many philosophers and historians of science do indeed assert
   that there is no single monolithic scientific method, this has never
   been tested empirically. We therefore approach this problem by
   analyzing patterns of language used by scientists in their published
   work. Our results demonstrate systematic variation in language use
   between types of science that are thought to differ in their
   characteristic methodologies. The features of language use that were
   found correspond closely to a proposed distinction between Experimental
   Sciences (e.g., chemistry) and Historical Sciences (e.g.,
   paleontology); thus, different underlying rhetorical and conceptual
   mechanisms likely operate for scientific reasoning and communication in
   different contexts.

AB Nondeterminism is a fundamental concept in computer science that
   appears in various contexts such as automata theory, algorithms and
   concurrent computation. We present a taxonomy of the different ways
   that nondeterminism can be defined and used; the categories of the
   taxonomy are domain, nature, implementation, consistency, execution and
   semantics. An historical survey shows how the concept was developed
   from its inception by Rabin & Scott, Floyd and Dijkstra, as well as the
   interplay between nondeterminism and concurrency. Computer science
   textbooks and pedagogical software are surveyed to determine how they
   present the concept; the results show that the treatment of
   nondeterminism is generally fragmentary and unsystematic. We conclude
   that the teaching of nondeterminism must be integrated through the
   computer science curriculum so that students learn to see
   nondeterminism both in terms of abstract mathematical entities and in
   terms of machines whose execution is unpredictable.

AB There is a tendency by scholars arguing for a more just and sustainable
   future to position the "ecological crisis" as a fundamental reason for
   major educational reforms. Relying on crisis-talk to fuel social and
   environmental justice and environmentalism reinforces the thinking of
   the past, which inadvertently perpetuates the acceptance of present
   cultural attitudes which frame our relationships with others and the
   natural world. To evaluate previous cultural thinking and associated
   traditions of Euro-West society, Chet Bowers asserts that we ought to
   analyze how assumptions are carried forward as metaphors, which are
   associated with attitudes towards science, technology, and nature. This
   pedagogy is called ecojustice education and serves to conserve and
   sustain cultural diversity and the biodiversity of Earth's ecosystems,
   which are threatened and vulnerable. But, also carried forward in the
   language of ecojustice philosophy (and other ecological works) is a
   presumption that feeds into scientifically proving that a crisis
   exists, which is associated with organizing schools around an implicit
   shock doctrine of fear and urgency. This paper explores these
   assumptions and others associated with a supposition of ecological
   crisis. The ecological crisis has the potential to marginalize many
   diverse people who are needed during these times of increasing
   ecological awareness and uncertainties. Situating education (and the
   world) in the frenzy associated with crisis, versus the assertion that
   schools should increase awareness around the belief that a more
   sustainable lifestyle is beneficial for the individual, the community
   and the environment is a worthwhile debate and is rich with respect to
   research opportunities in education.

TI The History of the Planar Elastica: Insights into Mechanics and
   Scientific Method
SO SCIENCE & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Euler's formula for the buckling of an elastic column is widely used in
   engineering design. However, only a handful of engineers will be
   familiar with Euler's classic paper De Curvis Elasticis in which the
   formula is derived. In addition to the Euler Buckling Formula, De
   Curvis Elasticis classifies all the bent configurations of elastic
   rod-a landmark in the development of a rational theory of continuum
   mechanics. As a historical case study, Euler's work on elastic rods
   offers an insight into some important concepts which underlie
   mechanics. It sheds light on the search for unifying principles of
   mechanics and the role of analysis. The connection between results
   obtained from theory and those obtained from experiments on rods,
   highlights two different approaches to scientific discovery, which can
   be traced back to Bacon, Descartes and Galileo. The bent rod also has
   an analogy in dynamics, with a pendulum, which highlights the crucial
   distinctions between initial value and boundary value problems and
   between linear and nonlinear differential equations. In addition to
   benefiting from the overview which a historical study provides, the
   particular problem of the elastica offers students of science and
   engineering a clear elucidation of the connection between mathematics
   and real-world engineering, issues which still have relevance today.

AB The present study aims to identify first year Turkish Science
   undergraduates' understandings and misconceptions of the concept of
   light and its propagation. For this purpose, an instrument composed of
   four open-ended questions was developed by the researchers. The
   diagnostic test was piloted with twenty students and modifications were
   made prior to the final administration of the test. The content
   validity of the test questions was assessed by two physics researchers
   and one lecturer. These questions were administered to a hundred first
   year undergraduates (aged 16-18) enrolled in the Science Teacher
   Training Department in Ataturk University in Turkey. In addition, the
   semi-structured interviews of 30-40 min were conducted with the four
   students whose responses involved common misunderstanding. All
   interview records were transcribed and analysed. The findings showed
   that undergraduates' understanding of light is poor and also they have
   important and prevalent misconceptions. Identified misconceptions, some
   of which have been reported in the literature, are discussed
   qualitatively. The misunderstandings identified were compared with
   those in the literature. The results have some implications for
   teaching light, suggesting that a substantial revision of teaching
   strategies is needed.

ID SCIENTIFIC LITERACY; SELF-EFFICACY; SCHOOL; TEACHERS; INSTRUCTION;

AB Given concerns with the low levels of explanation in science education
   classrooms, it has been suggested that text may supply a higher
   percentage of explanatory discourse than do classroom teachers.
   However, given that textbooks have been shown to differ little from
   teacher discourse in percentages of explanation, the present study
   sought to examine explanatory aspects of highly recommended trade books
   teachers might use in their science instruction. To that end, we
   examined a total of 43 trade books, 24 life science and 19 physical
   science, 7182 clauses in all, for the presence of explanation. We found
   significantly higher percentages (32.87) of explanatory clauses in
   physical science trade books than in life science (23.34) trade books.
   This trend was particularly pronounced in the physical science trade
   books targeted for the primary-grade audience. Our results suggest that
   trade books may represent an option for infusing more focus on
   explanation in the science classroom. However, we also caution that
   teacher background may limit the effectiveness of this larger presence
   of explanation. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 93:587-610, 2009

TI Translations of Scientific Practice to "Students' Images of Science"

ID HIGH-SCHOOL-STUDENTS; UNIVERSITY SCIENCE; VIEWS; CONCEPTIONS; LITERACY;

AB In the science education research literature, it often appears to be
   assumed that students "possess" more or less stable "images of science"
   that directly correspond to their experiences with scientific practice
   in science curricula. From cultural-historical and sociocultural
   perspectives, this assumption is problematic because scientific
   practices are collective human activities and are therefore neither
   identical with students' experiences nor with the accounts of these
   experiences that students make available to researchers. "Students'
   images of science" are therefore translated from (rather than directly
   correspond to) scientific practices. Drawing on data collected during
   and after preuniversity biology students' internships in a scientific
   laboratory, we exemplify the role of these translations in the
   production of "students' images of science." A coarse-grained analysis
   based on existing research showed our data to be comparable with
   earlier studies on "students' images of science." A fine-grained
   analysis shows how "students' images of science" were coproduced along
   a trajectory of translations that was determined by the use of
   particular actions and tools, and a particular division of labor in
   scientific practice. We propose to reconceptualize "students' images of
   science" as particular coproductions at a given point in time. The
   methodological and educational implications of this proposal are
   discussed. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 93:611-634, 2009

   ARGUMENTATION; INQUIRY; IMPACT
AB During the past decade science educators have taken steps to identify
   seminal structures and approaches of science teacher professional
   development. This literature, which is increasingly informing how and
   in which contexts professional developers design and implement
   programs, states that scientists' divergent research interests and
   knowledge about K-12 science teachers often limit their involvement in
   these programs. Conversely, concerns persist that there is very little
   empirical evidence to support these programmatic recommendations made
   by the science education literature. This embedded case study was
   bounded by the contextual similarities between seven professional
   development workshops with the goal of examining the relationship
   between scientists' views of teachers as professionals and the
   pedagogical orientations that the scientists used within these
   professional development contexts. Multiple methods were employed
   including systematic classroom observation by nine trained observers,
   as well as analysis of course materials, interviews, and
   questionnaires. Altogether, the teacher comments and observation data
   paint a picture of how the instructors implemented specific pedagogical
   orientations. Participants appear to have realistic views about the
   practical roles that research scientists can play in professional
   development. We explore how these findings merit attention and suggest
   alternatives to current practice and policy. (C) 2008 Wiley

AB Implementation of science curriculum materials has been a fundamental
   challenge in science education for decades. Policy researchers have
   argued that alignment of standards, curriculum, and assessment are the
   key to supporting implementation. This paper focuses on teachers'
   perceptions of curricular alignment and on curriculum implementation
   using empirical data from a statewide systemic inquiry science reform
   effort targeting students from kindergarten to eighth grade. We find
   that the success of alignment policies depends on teachers' construal
   of the relationship between standards and curriculum materials and on
   allocation of time for planning at the school level. (C) 2008 Wiley

ID SCIENCE; EDUCATION; TEACHERS; BELIEFS
AB The elementary science teacher educators in this article set recognize
   the challenges that new science teachers face when they enter
   classrooms. They have developed frameworks and strategies aimed at
   helping the preservice teachers with whom they work become
   "well-started beginners" who are ready to address problems of science
   teaching. To do so, these educators purposefully engage the candidates
   in focused dialogue regarding challenges or problems of practice that
   they will likely face in their work. These challenges include (1)
   engaging in science, (2) organizing instruction, and (3) understanding
   students. The science teacher educators use a dialogic third space to
   help the preservice teachers reconsider and develop deeper
   understandings of these problems of practice. In this introduction, we
   point out some of the common themes that tie these articles together,
   including (a) a focus on problems of practice in elementary science
   teaching. (b) a focus on dialogue with preservice teachers about these
   problems of practice, (c) a commitment to developing tools and
   approaches that support principled reasoning about these problems of
   practice, and (d) a commitment to shared goals and methods for research
   on elementary science teacher education. We point to ways that these
   themes are addressed in the three articles. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals,

ID CONTENT REPRESENTATIONS; SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY; KNOWLEDGE; CLASSROOMS;

AB New views of proficiency in K-8 science that highlight the importance
   of engaging children in the discourses and practices of science have
   raised the stakes for elementary teachers and the teacher educators who
   prepare them. In this paper, a framework for teaching science as
   argument is presented. The framework is advanced as a means of
   addressing problems of practices faced by preservice teachers, creating
   coherence for the design of teacher education experiences, and serving
   as a tool for shaping a design-based research agenda. Findings of three
   research studies that examined preservice teachers' developing
   understandings and practices for teaching science as argument and the
   ways in which teacher education experiences mediated learning are
   synthesized. Across the studies, findings suggest that the framework
   serves as a powerful scaffold for preservice teachers' developing
   thinking and practice. More specifically, early attention to evidence
   and argument can leverage other important aspects of effective science
   teaching, such as attention to classroom discourse and the role of the
   teacher in monitoring and assessing children's thinking. In closing, a
   case is made for coherence among science learning opportunities,
   learning to teach science experiences, and field experiences. (C) 2009

TI Developing Preservice Elementary Teachers' Knowledge and Practices
   Through Modeling-Centered Scientific Inquiry
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article

   MATHEMATICS; TEXTBOOKS; LEARN; MEDIA
AB Preservice elementary teachers face many challenges in learning how to
   teach science effectively, such as engaging students in science,
   organizing instruction, and developing a productive learning community.
   This paper reports on several iterative cycles of design-based research
   aimed at fostering preservice teachers' principled reasoning around
   these problems of practice through modeling-centered scientific
   inquiry. The first design cycle introduced preservice teachers to
   modeling and simulation software tools in an effort to advance their
   understanding of science and technology; the second used an
   instructional framework embodying modeling-centered inquiry to advance
   their views of effective science teaching and their lesson-planning
   practices; the third engaged preservice teachers in analyzing and
   modifying curriculum materials using reform-based criteria to foster
   effective curriculum materials use. Outcomes from these iterations
   indicate that the preservice teachers were most likely to advance their
   knowledge and practices within a coherent approach that focused on a
   core scientific practice such as modeling-centered inquiry, provided
   opportunities to unpack and apply robust tools such as reform-based
   instructional frameworks, and addressed their perceived problems of
   practice. The findings from this set of approaches are compared to
   others in an effort to point toward promising future directions for
   effective science teacher education. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Does concept-mapping strategy work for everyone? The levels of

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
ID KNOWLEDGE MAPS; STUDENTS; CLASSROOM; RECALL
AB The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of concept-mapping
   strategies with three different generativity levels (expert-generated
   concept map, partially learner-generated concept map, fully
   learner-generated concept map) on knowledge acquisition. Interaction
   between learners' self-regulated learning (SRL) skills and different
   levels of generativity was also tested. One hundred twenty-four
   undergraduate students, randomly assigned to three different
   concept-mapping groups, were differentiated by high and low levels of
   SRL skills. The findings suggest that the participants in the fully
   learner-generated map group significantly outperformed the participants
   in the expert-generated map group, and participants with high SRL
   skills significantly outperformed those with low SRL skills across all
   treatment levels.

TI Optimising the use of note-taking as an external cognitive aid for

ID GRAPHIC ORGANIZERS; NOTETAKING
AB Taking notes is of uttermost importance in academic and commercial use
   and success. Different techniques for note-taking utilise different
   cognitive processes and strategies. This experimental study examined
   ways to enhance cognitive performance via different note-taking
   techniques. By comparing performances of traditional, linear style
   note-taking with alternative non-linear technique, we aimed to examine
   the efficiency and importance of different ways of taking notes.
   Twenty-six volunteer adult learners from an information management
   course participated in this study. Cognitive performance scores from a
   traditional linear note-taking group were compared with another group
   by using a commercially available non-linear note-taking technique.
   Both groups were tested in two settings: after a classroom lecture and
   a panel forum discussion. Tasks included measures on story
   comprehension, memory, complexity of mental representations and
   metacognitive skills. Data analysis revealed that the non-linear
   note-takers were significantly better than the linear group both in
   terms of the quantity and the quality of the learned material. This
   study demonstrates the importance of using cognitively compatible
   note-taking techniques. It identifies the cognitive mechanisms behind
   effective note-taking and knowledge representation. Using such
   techniques enables deeper understanding and more integrated knowledge
   management.

AB Research in multimedia learning lacks an emphasis on individual
   difference variables, such as working memory capacity (WMC). The
   effects of WMC and the segmentation of multimedia instruction were
   examined by assessing the recall and application of low (n = 66) and
   high (n = 67) working memory capacity students randomly assigned to
   either a segmented instruction (SI) or non-segmented instruction (NSI)
   version of a multimedia tutorial on historical inquiry. WMC was found
   to have a significant, positive effect on participants' recall and
   application scores; however, the use of segmentation mediated the
   effects of WMC to allow learners with lower WMC to recall and apply
   equal to those with higher WMC.

AB This paper reports on the development of a scale for determining the
   quality of the student e-learning experience at the degree level when
   the student learning context is predominately a campus-based
   experience. Rapid developments in the use of information and
   communication technologies (ICT) in higher education require methods
   for evaluating the contribution of such tools to student learning,
   especially when they are complementing a face-to-face experience. We
   examine the psychometric functioning of a proposed e-learning scale in
   relation to a well-validated degree-level teaching evaluation
   instrument, the Student Course Experience Questionnaire. The e-learning
   scale has suitable reliability and validity in the present sample of
   undergraduate students for quality assurance activities around ICT.

TI The impact of mobile learning on students' learning behaviours and
   performance: Report from a large blended classroom
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Chinese classrooms, whether on school grounds or online, have long
   suffered from a lack of interactivity. Many online classes simply
   provide recorded instructor lectures, which only reinforces the
   negative effects of passive nonparticipatory learning. At Shanghai
   Jiaotong University, researchers and developers actively seek
   technologic interventions that can greatly increase interactivity in
   large blended classes. They developed a cutting-edge mobile learning
   system that can deliver live broadcasts of real-time classroom teaching
   to students with mobile devices. Their system allows students to
   customise means of content-reception based on when and where they tune
   into the broadcast. The system also supports short text messaging and
   instant polls. Through these venues, students can ask questions and
   make suggestions in real time, and the instructor can address them
   immediately. This article describes this system in detail, and also
   reports results from a formal implementation of the system in a blended
   English classroom of 1000 students (with about 800 being online). As
   the data reveal, m-learning activities can much better engage students
   in the learning process. Students in this class changed from passive
   learners to truly engaged learners who are behaviourally,
   intellectually and emotionally involved in their learning tasks.

TI Exploring the effects of gender and learning styles on computer
   programming performance: implications for programming pedagogy
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID DELINEATOR
AB Computer programming has been taught in secondary schools for more than
   two decades. However, little is known about how students learn to
   program. From the curriculum implementation perspectives, learning
   style helps address the issue of learner differences, resulting in a
   shift from a teacher-centred approach to a learner-focused approach.
   This study aims to investigate the effects of gender and learning
   styles on computer programming performance. The Gregorc Style
   Delineator (GSD) was employed to measure learning styles. A test was
   administered to assess students' programming performance. Two hundred
   and seventeen secondary school students of age from 14 to 19
   participated in this study. Results indicated that no gender
   differences in programming performance were found after controlling for
   the effect of student ability. Academic ability had a differential
   effect on programming knowledge. Sequential learners in general
   performed better than random learners. These results suggest the
   importance of the ordering dimension of the GSD in influencing
   programming performance. Implications of the findings in relation to
   programming pedagogy are discussed in this paper.

AB While numerous previous studies have focused on the use of some
   corporate e-learning programmes (CELP), little is known about the
   difference between users' pre-installation reactions to CELP and user's
   post-installation reactions to CELP. This study narrows the above gap
   with two investigations into a financial company's CELP. In the
   pre-installation phase, we surveyed users' need for cognition,
   attitudes towards corporate e-learning and intentions for the use of
   corporate e-learning (INT) in relation to the CELP. Ten months after
   the installation, we conducted a second investigation to examine
   learning outcomes on the basis of users' perceptions of CELP utility,
   CELP satisfaction, affective reaction to CELP and the actual CELP usage
   (UGE). We examined the proposed model with multiple regression analyses
   and found a gap between INT and UGE. The second investigation
   identified potential factors that contributed to the differences in UGE
   between two groups of high-INT learners. Results indicated that time
   management and technical problems were the two critical factors that
   led to UGE differences. Findings of this study can illuminate
   relationships among learners' attitudes, usage and reaction towards the
   CELP.

TI Analysis of the supporting websites for the use of instructional games

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper identifies resources to be included in a website designed to
   facilitate the integration of instructional games in K-12 settings.
   Guidelines and supporting components are based on a survey of K-12
   educators who are integrating games, an analysis of existing
   instructional game websites, and summaries of literature on the use of
   educational software in K-12 settings and teacher technology training.
   The results indicate that educators face three main challenges when
   integrating games, including: (1) curriculum integration, (2) technical
   and logistical requirements, and (3) teacher training. To overcome
   these challenges, K-12 educators should be provided with: (1)
   curriculum resources, (2) game technical information and support, and
   (3) communication tools. Websites designed to facilitate the use of
   instructional games should be designed with appropriate structures (ie,
   grid, web, hierarchy) to optimise organisation and simplicity. In
   addition, the websites should include teacher training that (1) apply a
   teacher training model, (2) address National Educational Technology
   Standards, (3) present contents in small doses, (4) make training and
   information as accessible as possible, and (5) model and mentor the use
   of instructional games.

ID GONE WRONG; GRUNBAUM; GOD; SCIENTISTS; RELIGION
AB Whether science can reach conclusions with substantial worldview
   import, such as whether supernatural beings exist or the universe is
   purposeful, is a significant but unsettled aspect of science. For
   instance, various scientists, philosophers, and educators have explored
   the implications of science for a theistic worldview, with opinions
   spanning the spectrum from positive to neutral to negative. To
   delineate a mainstream perspective on science, seven key
   characterizations or "pillars" of science are adopted from position
   papers from the world's largest scientific organization, the American
   Association for the Advancement of Science. Based on those pillars and
   an examination of scientific method, I argue that the presuppositions
   and reasoning of science can and should be worldview independent, but
   empirical and public evidence from the sciences and humanities can
   support conclusions that are worldview distinctive. I also critique
   several problematic perspectives: asserting that science can say
   nothing about worldviews and the opposite extreme of insisting that
   science decisively supports one particular worldview; weakening science
   so severely that it lacks truth claims; and burdening science with
   unnecessary presuppositions. Worldview-distinctive conclusions based on
   empirical evidence are suitable for individual convictions and public
   discussions, but not for institutional endorsements and scientific
   literacy requirements.

AB Worldviews are not only about whether God exists or whether the world
   has a purpose. They can contain a lot more, or they can differ in
   excluding the existence of God and/or a purpose for the world. In this
   article we define worldviews as answering a variety of worldview
   questions, which we list. Once this is recognized, it becomes clear
   that scientific worldviews are also a species of worldviews that should
   not be dismissed categorically. We then distinguish between the project
   of constructing a scientific worldview and asking whether science
   itself has any worldview content. We argue that science, even when it
   is characterized quite minimally, does have worldview content. This has
   some important implications for science education, which we draw.

AB This paper discusses the impact of contemporary scientific knowledge on
   worldviews. The first three sections provide epistemological background
   for the arguments that follow. Sections 2 and 3 discuss the reliable
   part of science, specifically the characterization, scope and limits of
   the present scientific canon. Section 4 deals with the mode of thinking
   responsible for both the canon's credibility and its power to guide
   speculative activity. With these preliminaries in place, the remainder
   of the paper addresses the issue of tolerance to "alternative
   perspectives". The analyses in this part focus on the extent to which
   mature scientific thought embodies open-mindedness, with pluralism and
   competition between perspectives as central themes. I argue for four
   related claims, concerning scientific literacy, the impact of the canon
   on rational speculation, the limits of scientific pluralism, and the
   popular idea that recent forms of "scientific (natural) theology" have
   rational merit and can help worldview-making in our age, respectively:
   (C1) Which theories and narratives (or parts of them) belong in the
   scientific canon, and whether they are worldview independent, are
   matters contingent upon the state of knowledge-not something one can
   convincingly determine on metascientific or transcendental insight.
   (C2) The current scientific canon and its associated methodology
   provide research with strong directionality, often against popular
   currents. (C3) Current science does marginalize some views dear to many
   people. (C4) Although natural theology "officially" purports to embody
   scientific methodology, all it presently has on offer are poorly
   thought out ventures embodying (at best) only relaxed versions of that
   methodology; if so, the relationship between current projects in
   natural theology and science cannot (without begging the question) be
   reasonably described as one of "partial overlap", "mutual
   modification", or "ongoing complementarity".

TI The Electromagnetic Conception of Nature at the Root of the Special and
   General Relativity Theories and its Revolutionary Meaning
SO SCIENCE & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID EINSTEIN; HILBERT; DISCOVERY; MATTER
AB The revolution in XX century physics, induced by relativity theories,
   had its roots within the electromagnetic conception of Nature. It was
   developed through a tradition related to Brunian and Leibnizian
   physics, to the German Naturphilosophie and English XIXth physics. The
   electromagnetic conception of Nature was in some way realized by the
   relativistic dynamics of Poincar, of 1905. Einstein, on the contrary,
   after some years, linked relativistic dynamics to a semi-mechanist
   conception of Nature. He developed general relativity theory on the
   same ground, but Hilbert formulated it starting from the
   electromagnetic conception of Nature. Here, a comparison between these
   two conceptions is proposed in order to understand the conceptual
   foundations of special relativity within the context of the changing
   world views. The whole history of physics as well as history of science
   can be considered as a conflict among different worldviews. Every
   theory, as well as every different formulation of a theory implies a
   different worldview: a particular image of Nature implies a particular
   image of God (atheism too has a particular image of God) as well as of
   mankind and of their relationship. Thus, it is very relevant for
   scientific education to point out which image of Nature belongs to a
   particular formulation of a theory, which image comes to dominate and
   for which ideological reason.

AB This article begins by examining whether 'science' and 'religion' can
   better be seen as distinct or related worldviews, focusing particularly
   on scientific and religious understandings of biodiversity. I then
   explore how people can see the natural world, depending on their
   worldview, by looking at two contrasting treatments of penguin
   behaviour, namely that provided in the film March of the Penguins and
   in the children's book And Tango Makes Three. I end by drawing some
   initial conclusions as to what might and what might not be included
   about religion in school science lessons. Science educators and
   teachers need to take account of religious worldviews if some students
   are better to understand the compass of scientific thinking and some of
   science's key conclusions. It is perfectly possible for a science
   teacher to be respectful of the worldviews that students occupy, even
   if these are scientifically limited, while clearly and
   non-apologetically helping them to understand the scientific worldview
   on a particular issue.

   Scientific and Religious Worldviews
SO SCIENCE & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Worldviews; Nature of science; Religion; Faith; Theism; Science
   education
AB Arguments about the relationship between science and religion often
   proceed by identifying a set of essential characteristics of scientific
   and religious worldviews and arguing on the basis of these
   characteristics for claims about a relationship of conflict or
   compatibility between them. Such a strategy is doomed to failure
   because science, to some extent, and religion, to a much larger extent,
   are cultural phenomena that are too diverse in their expressions to be
   characterized in terms of a unified worldview. In this paper I follow a
   different strategy. Having offered a loose characterization of the
   nature of science, I pose five questions about specific areas where
   religious and scientific worldviews may conflict-questions about the
   nature of faith, the belief in a God or Gods, the authority of sacred
   texts, the relationship between scientific and religious conceptions of
   the mind/soul, and the relationship between scientific and religious
   understandings of moral behavior. My review of these questions will
   show that they cannot be answered unequivocally because there is no
   agreement amongst religious believers as to the meaning of important
   religious concepts. Thus, whether scientific and religious worldviews
   conflict depends essentially upon whose science and whose religion one
   is considering. In closing, I consider the implications of this
   conundrum for science education.

AB Several prominent scientists, philosophers, and scientific institutions
   have argued that science cannot test supernatural worldviews on the
   grounds that (1) science presupposes a naturalistic worldview
   (Naturalism) or that (2) claims involving supernatural phenomena are
   inherently beyond the scope of scientific investigation. The present
   paper argues that these assumptions are questionable and that indeed
   science can test supernatural claims. While scientific evidence may
   ultimately support a naturalistic worldview, science does not
   presuppose Naturalism as an a priori commitment, and supernatural
   claims are amenable to scientific evaluation. This conclusion
   challenges the rationale behind a recent judicial ruling in the United
   States concerning the teaching of "Intelligent Design" in public
   schools as an alternative to evolution and the official statements of
   two major scientific institutions that exert a substantial influence on
   science educational policies in the United States. Given that science
   does have implications concerning the probable truth of supernatural
   worldviews, claims should not be excluded a priori from science
   education simply because they might be characterized as supernatural,
   paranormal, or religious. Rather, claims should be excluded from
   science education when the evidence does not support them, regardless
   of whether they are designated as 'natural' or 'supernatural'.

TI The Interplay of Scientific Activity, Worldviews and Value Outlooks
SO SCIENCE & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Scientific activity tends to reflect particular worldviews and their
   associated value outlooks; and scientific results sometimes have
   implications for worldviews and the presuppositions of value outlooks.
   Even so, scientific activity per se neither presupposes nor provides
   sound rational grounds to accept any worldview or value outlook.
   Moreover, in virtue of reflecting a suitable variety of worldviews and
   value outlooks, perhaps including some religious ones, science is
   better able to further its aim. An extended argument is made that,
   although the materialist worldview has de facto been widely associated
   with the development of modern science, the scope of scientific inquiry
   is improperly limited when constraints, derived from materialism, are
   generally placed upon admissible scientific theories. Some implications
   for science education are sketched in the conclusion.

TI Modern Science and Conservative Islam: An Uneasy Relationship
SO SCIENCE & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Familiar Western debates about religion, science, and science education
   have parallels in the Islamic world. There are difficulties reconciling
   conservative, traditional versions of Islam with modern science,
   particularly theories such as evolution. As a result, many conservative
   Muslim thinkers are drawn toward creationism, hopes of Islamizing
   science, or other ways to retain the primacy of faith while continuing
   efforts to catch up with modern technology. Muslims argue that science
   and Islam coexist in harmony, but both intellectually and
   institutionally, the Islamic world harbors many tensions between
   science and religion.

TI Framing the activities of institutions and academic development units
   in support of assessment
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE assessment; academic development; Academic Development Unit
AB The assessment-related activities of academic development units (ADU)
   are driven not only by institutional initiatives and the pursuit of
   particular research interests but also by less predictable factors
   including the emerging needs of faculty members and external funding
   opportunities. When not located within a strong classification
   framework, institutional initiatives and the activities of ADUs can be
   experienced as fragmented and episodic events, a situation that denies
   participants and other stakeholders a sense of striving towards and
   achieving substantial goals. This paper proposes two classification
   frameworks - one for the organisation of the types of initiatives that
   universities commonly undertake in encouraging enhanced assessment
   practice and another for the functions of the ADU. Application of the
   two organisational frameworks offers a systematic approach to the
   development of institutional assessment plans and informs the ways in
   which the resources of the academic development unit can be deployed
   most strategically in their operationalisation.

DE portfolio; doctoral education; dissertation; professional doctorate
AB This paper outlines the potential of the portfolio as a product of
   doctoral work, especially in the Professional Doctorates. It compares
   the traditional mode of a single, lengthy but clearly focused doctoral
   dissertation with the portfolio as a collection of shorter research
   reports, held together by a linking paper articulating the thesis. We
   argue that the portfolio is appropriate for the Professional Doctorate
   that focuses upon improvement in the professional workplace and that
   coherence and significance are key issues.

AB This paper describes a study of online discussion forums as tools for
   promoting higher-order thinking. The study was carried out in a women's
   university in the United Arab Emirates. Data, in the form of online
   discussion forum transcripts, were collected over a 20-week semester
   and were analysed according to a model developed by Garrison, Anderson,
   and Archer (2001). Discussion forum postings were analysed for evidence
   of higher-order thinking and were placed within one of the model's
   categories of 'triggering', 'exploration', 'integration', or
   'resolution'. The researchers did find evidence of higher-order
   thinking processes. The results showed that the majority of postings
   were either categorised as 'exploration' or 'integration'. The results
   also supported the notion that the correct conditions need to be
   present in order for higher-order thinking to arise. The findings
   suggested that the initial teacher prompt or question may have had a
   bearing on the nature of learners' postings.

TI Teaching and evaluation of critical appraisal skills to postgraduate
   ESL engineering students
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE engineering; critical appraisal; international student; English as a
   Second Language
AB Enrolments in postgraduate engineering in Australia include a
   significant proportion of Asian ESL (English as a Second Language)
   students, and there is some debate in the literature about whether they
   are capable of critical appraisal. Content-based discipline-specific
   EAP (English for Academic Purposes) courses provide an environment for
   addressing the language, writing, and critical appraisal needs of such
   students. In particular, there is evidence that a 'sustained' approach
   to critical appraisal through engaging with engineering content is the
   best environment for this significant cohort. Despite this, such
   programmes are relatively rare in higher education partly as a result
   of the peripheral status of language and academic skills in relation to
   engineering knowledge and practice. This case study outlines the
   curriculum framework and rationale for a content-based EAP response to
   teaching critical appraisal skills and examines evaluative feedback
   from an open-ended survey of three semester cohorts of students (n=64,
   85% response rate) regarding their encounter with critical thinking and
   practice. The paper argues both that discipline-specific EAP courses
   are an appropriate place to teach critical appraisal skills and
   contributes to the debate on the capacity of ESL students to develop
   this skill.

ID ELECTRONIC VOTING SYSTEM
AB This article describes the use of an Electronic Voting System (EVS) in
   large group lectures within a business and management undergraduate
   degree programme, in an attempt to make them more interactive. The
   intention was to ensure that the introduction of the EVS-style lecture
   was educationally driven, linked to interactive learning activities in
   the lecture, and reflected a clearly articulated understanding of the
   kind of learning that was appropriate for these students. Findings are
   presented and discussed in terms of the impact on students' learning
   and on the role of the lecturer. Our conclusions show that the
   students' experience of the EVS interactive lectures fell into three
   distinct stages and that students fall into one of three types, based
   on their general relationship to EVS-based lectures. In addition,
   EVS-style lectures impacted significantly on the role of lecturers.
   Finally, the findings demonstrate that interactive lectures that are
   supported by technology, but that are driven by educational ends, can
   enhance students' learning.

AB This paper explores the feasibility of using a blended approach to
   postgraduate research-degree supervision. Such a model could reduce
   research supervisors' workloads and improve the quality and success of
   Masters and Doctoral students' research output. The paper presents a
   case study that is based on a framework that was originally designed
   for blended learning activities. It is based on supporting different
   types of interaction between postgraduate research students and their
   supervisors. The findings show that a blended approach to postgraduate
   supervision improves the supervision process, reduces the
   administrative workload of the supervisor, and creates a dynamic record
   of the supervision process. The results to date imply that traditional
   supervision practice needs to be revisited and modified to include
   digital procedures. The research project is in its infancy and, since
   at least three years is necessary for the completion of postgraduate
   degrees, this paper reports only on the first two stages of the
   research project.

AB In the UK, the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 created a positive
   duty on the public sector to promote disability equality. This duty
   extends to higher education and local planning authorities. Based on
   Zuber-Skerrit's CRASP model for professional development, this paper
   examines an initiative to enact the duty. It details a completed action
   research project with undergraduate students and an adult learning
   project, that works with adults labeled as 'learning disabled'. The
   paper considers how this co-educational learning experience enabled the
   undergraduate students to engage with the principles of inclusive
   design in the built environment and offers a model for how inclusive
   policy and practice may be implemented at the university level, and
   particularly in built environment courses.

AB The paper describes the integration of web resources and technology as
   instructional and learning tools in oral history projects. The
   computer-mediated oral history project centred around interviews with
   community elders combined with new technologies to engage students in
   authentic historical inquiry. The study examined learners' affective
   attitudes and cognitive perceptions in grades 5 to 11 in order to
   understand the challenges and opportunities that students faced in the
   project. Data were collected using interviews with students and
   teachers, electronic group projects on the web, the researcher's
   observations, and a subjective-qualitative questionnaire. Qualitative
   analyses consisted of categorical and thematic analysis. With respect
   to categorical analysis, the excerpts of students' responses were
   categorised using two codes based on whether they related more to the
   challenges or advantages of the project. These multiple categories were
   then aggregated into larger analytic themes. The study showed that from
   this computer-mediated oral historical project, students were provided
   opportunities to develop better insight into the past, better
   historical thinking, and more positive attitudes toward the elders. The
   project challenged learners to conduct historical inquiry with
   technology while facilitating the development of historical thinking,
   honing interview skills, enhancing computer literacy, sharpening
   critical thinking, and problem-solving, as well as nurturing
   interpersonal and teamwork skills. Some challenges to the
   implementation of computer-mediated historical projects are discussed.

AB We designed an e-learning model to promote critical thinking about
   basic science topics in online communities of students during work
   placements in higher education. To determine the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the model we explored the online discussions in two case
   studies. We evaluated the quantity of the interactions by looking at
   quantitative data of the discussion 'threads' and we evaluated the
   quality of the discussion by content analysis of the individual
   messages. Both the procedural facilitation of the discussion and the
   instrument for content analysis were based on Garrison's 'Practical
   Inquiry model of Cognitive Presence'. Furthermore, we explored the
   experiences of the students and moderators by interviewing them and we
   organised their perceptions using the framework of an activity system.
   On the basis of the quantitative and qualitative data we conclude that
   the e-learning model was successful in establishing a dialogue among a
   group of students and an expert during work placements at different
   locations. The 'Practical Inquiry model' was useful in facilitating a
   sustained on-topic discourse involving critical thinking. Although the
   amount of critical thinking was moderate, the results suggest ways to
   increase integration and resolution activities in the online
   discussions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Agreement on the effectiveness of the technology mentoring approach in
   addressing educators' needs for learning different technologies has
   been growing. Literature on the concept of mentoring in general and
   technology mentoring specifically has indicated mentoring relationships
   in different settings provide benefits for the less experienced
   mentoring partner, while existing literature was limited in providing
   insights about mentoring from the more experienced partner's point of
   view. But, studies have suggested that understanding mentors' reactions
   to the experience is necessary to establish sustainable and mutually
   beneficial mentoring relationships. For this purpose, this study
   discusses and proposes an assessment framework and an instrument to
   examine benefits for technology mentors. Considering the lack of
   similar studies and the absence of an instrument designed specifically
   to study this subject, we believe that our study will contribute to the
   knowledge base by providing educators with an assessment strategy and a
   tool for investigating the benefits gained by the more experienced
   person (graduate student in our context) benefits in a technology
   mentoring relationship. In addition, the resulting survey instrument
   provided along with this study is a valuable tool for those studying
   technology mentoring. The theoretical foundations, development process
   of the development of the instrument, and reliability and validity
   issues are discussed in detail. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   lamenting school students' lack of information literacy skills,
   including working with online resources, provides little research
   investigating classroom teachers' knowledge of information literacy
   skills and their related pedagogical practice. The findings of this

AB This study investigates the effectiveness of computer-delivered hints
   in relation to problem-solving abilities in two alternative indirect
   instruction schemes. In one instruction scheme, hints are available to
   students immediately after they are given a new problem to solve as
   well as after they have completed the problem. in the other scheme,
   hints are only available as worked out problems after students have
   finished their solution. The instruction schemes are supplied by means
   of a web-based program, Physhint, which supports the development of
   strategic knowledge [Pol, H. J., Harskamp, E. G., & Suhre, C. J. M.
   (2008). The effect of the timing of instructional support in a
   computer-supported problem-solving program for students in secondary
   physics education. Computers in Human Behavior, 24, 1156-1178]. This
   program supports novice problem solvers while undertaking physics
   problems concerned with forces by providing hints structured in
   accordance with Schoenfeld's episodes [Schoenfeld, A. H. (1992).
   Learning to think mathematically: Problem solving, metacognition, and
   sense making in mathematics. In D. A. Grouvvs (Ed.), Handbook of
   research on mathematics teaching (pp. 224-270). New York: McMillan
   Publishing].
   An experiment was carried out in four schools in order to study
   students' use of the hints in both of the computerized instruction
   schemes, as well as the effect of different uses of the available hints
   on students' ability to solve physics problems. The experiment
   consisted of three groups. Two groups of students were assigned to one
   of the two instruction schemes and a control group was selected for the
   purpose of comparison.
   The results of the experiment show that both computerized instruction
   schemes are effective. Students working with the most elaborate
   instruction scheme show an increased use of their pallet of heuristics
   and algorithms in the post-test. Furthermore, the instruction scheme in
   which hints are available to students during problem-solving proves to
   be most effective when students show an increase in the systematic use
   of hints during problem-solving. This paper therefore provides an
   insight into how a computer program implemented in school practice can
   improve students' strategic knowledge. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

TI Can the grammar of schooling be changed?

DE ICT integration; Out-school programs; Grammar of schooling
ID FIELD TRIPS; TECHNOLOGY
AB In this article we propose that the grammar of schooling [Tyack, D., &
   Tobin, W. (1994). The "grammar" of schooling: Why has it been so hard
   to change? American Educational Research Journal, 31(3), 453-479.] is
   responsible not only for the well-known and world-wide difficulties in
   integrating ICT into formal educational settings, but also for the
   replication of traditional models when this integration occurs. In
   clear contrast with this domain, in out-of-school projects ICT is
   integrated in innovative and truly "disruptive" [Blin, F., & Munro, M.
   (2008). Why hasnt technology disrupted academic teaching practices.
   Understanding resistance to change through the lens of activity theory.
   Computers and Education, 50(2), 475-490.] ways. To exemplify this
   integration, we have selected and described two successful, although
   different in nature, out-of-school projects. The first one, Pincel y
   Raton, seeks to develop creativity in children and to educate them to
   use ICT in a reflexive and useful manner. The second project, Menosca,
   pursues children's understanding of their historical and social
   environment through the use of GPSs, digital photography and web-page
   design. Both experiences underscore the multiple and varied
   possibilities that ICT affords for meaningful learning when the
   constraints inherent to the school setting do not seem to apply. By
   contrasting the formal and the out-of-school experiences, it is
   possible to unveil and bring to consciousness the principles and rules
   of the "grammar of schooling". We propose that becoming aware of the
   features of this grammar, i.e., philosophy, course design, time and
   place, tasks, resources, outcomes and products and assessment, is the
   first step toward change. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a novel instructional model for e-learning and an
   evaluation study to determine the effectiveness of this model for
   teaching Java language programming to information technology
   specialists working for the Spanish Public Administration. This is a
   general-purpose model that combines objectivist and constructivist
   learning theories and is based on the concept of learning objective.
   The purpose of the evaluation study is to find out whether the results
   of using this distance learning instructional model to teach this
   subject are comparable to learning in a traditional face-to-face
   classroom, with the plus of eliminating travel and maintenance expenses
   of the public servants attending the course and also saving time. The
   learners, selected at random to participate in this study, were divided
   into three groups depending on the type of teaching/learning they
   received: traditional classroom, distance learning with virtualized
   course contents and distance learning based on the proposed
   instructional model. The results indicate that the grades and
   satisfaction levels were similar for learners taught using the proposed
   instructional model and learners taught in the traditional classroom.
   Moreover, they were substantially better than for distance learning
   with virtualized contents, although the mean course learning time is
   greater. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   toward web-based professional development. The sample of this study
   included 421 teachers, coming from 20 elementary schools in Taiwan. The
   three instruments used to assess teachers' Internet self-efficacy
   (ISS), beliefs about web-based learning (BWL), and attitudes toward
   web-based professional development (AWPD) revealed high reliability. In
   this study, the results supported that teachers' Internet self-efficacy
   and beliefs about web-based learning were important predictors of their
   attitudes toward web-based professional development. The belief for the
   positive consequences of web-based learning is very important for the
   favorable attitudes toward web-based professional development. (C) 2009

AB The popularity of video games has transcended entertainment crossing
   into the world of education. While the literature base on educational
   gaming is growing, there is still a lack of systematic study of this
   emerging technology's efficacy. This quasi-experimental study evaluated
   a teacher created video game on genetics in terms of its affective and
   cognitive impact on student users. While statistical results indicated
   no differences (p > .05)in student learning as measured by our
   instrument, there were significant differences (p < .05) found in the
   participants' level of engagement while interfacing with the video
   game. Implications on this emerging line of inquiry are discussed. (C)

AB The widespread use of the Internet and the convenient mechanism it
   provides. such as easy access, easy downloads, and easy copy and paste
   functions have made many types of unethical behaviors easier,
   particularly those involving students in academic settings. Among the
   issues in ethics within the academic environment that can be triggered
   by the Internet are fraudulence, plagiarism, falsification,
   delinquency, unauthorized help, and facility misuse. Given these
   issues, the study seeks to investigate the extent to which students at
   a public university in Malaysia engage in such unethical behavior and
   their relationship with the big five personality model. This study was
   conducted using a survey method of 252 students in three different
   academic faculties. The results of factor analyses confirm and refine
   the reliability of the scales for both big five personality variables
   and unethical Internet behaviors as conceptualized through Internet
   triggered academic dishonesty (ITADS). The findings indicate that
   personality traits such as (1) agreeableness, (2) conscientiousness and
   (3) emotional stability are significantly and negatively correlated
   with unethical Internet behavior in university students. Significant
   differences in facility misuse are also observed between the three
   academic faculties investigated. This research should provide
   significant contributions to educators in designing the computer ethics
   curriculum and in allowing for educational institutions as well as
   other organizations in developing relevant policies and guidelines on
   matters pertaining to academic conduct, utilization of computers and
   Internet, and recruitment exercises. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB With rapid emergence to the birth of the knowledge era, an active and
   interactive learning environment is fundamental to any teaching and
   learning process. Over time, negative implications of traditional
   learning environment are mounting, and measures must be taken to
   challenge it. With extensive research on available learning tools, it
   has become more feasible to provide our students with better learning
   opportunities. Such was the anticipation in the Malaysian educational
   context. Hence, this paper aims to address qualitative findings of a
   study on self-regulated learning strategies conveyed through the
   proposed interactive e-learning community (iELC). In duration of eight
   weeks, students (n = 50) from regular national secondary schools were
   subjected to online learning tasks aimed to advance strategies on
   self-regulated learning. To date, strategies of self-regulated learning
   have been perceived as key to learner to succeed academically and after
   the schooling years. By means of semi-structured interview, data were
   collected from small group and one-to-one perception. Results were
   directed at the overall development of self-regulated learning
   strategies and its diffusion in the iELC discussion platform.
   Conclusively, these findings add significantly to the understanding of
   self-regulated learning strategies in an online learning environment.

AB Higher education institutions deliver web-based learning with varied
   success. The success rate of distributed online courses remains low.
   Factors such as ineffective course facilitation and insufficient
   communication contribute to the unfulfilled promises of web-based
   learning. Students consequently feel unmotivated. Instructor control
   and in the courseroom further isolates students, whereas success rate
   increases when students unite in virtual communities. King (2002)
   increased student participation in his online classes by creating a
   virtual student, Joe, as a participating student and supplementary
   facilitator. This investigation responds to King's call for further
   directions on how a virtual helper enhances online facilitation. This
   inspired our investigation of how Virtual Jane might augment online
   facilitation. King's prediction, "It seems that Joe Bags may have a
   family in the future," (p. 164) became a reality in a South African
   masters' web-based class on web-based learning. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The present study focuses on the design and development of an
   instructional approach to develop oral presentation skills. The
   theoretical base builds on the social cognitive perspective, and
   self-regulated learning. The aim of the study is to investigate whether
   the design of a multimedia-based instructional format - comprising of a
   standardised multimedia instruction, practical activities and feedback
   - will enhance oral presentation skills. In the study, the differential
   effect of three 'modes of feedback' on performance has been researched.
   The results reveal that oral presentation skills did improve
   significantly after the instruction. The multimedia nature of the
   design was favoured by all participants. In contrast, no significant
   impact of feedback was found. Nevertheless, feedback proved to be a
   useful process that was highly welcomed by participants. (C) 2009

AB This article investigates the relationship between policy
   (conceptualised as goals, values and resources), organisational culture
   and e-learning use. Through both qualitative and quantitative research
   methods, we gathered data about staff and student perspectives from
   four diverse South African universities representing a selection of ICT
   in education policy types (Structured and Unstructured) and
   organisational cultural types of "collegium, bureaucracy, corporate and
   enterprise" (McNay, 1995). While our findings show a clear relationship
   between policy and use of ICTs for teaching and learning,
   organisational culture is found crucial to policy mediation and the way
   that e-learning use is embedded within the organisation. We conclude
   that although a Structured Corporate institutional type enables the
   attainment of a "critical mass" within e-learning, Unstructured
   Collegium institutions are better at fostering innovation. Unstructured
   Bureaucratic institutions are the least enabling of either top down or
   bottom up e-learning change. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study investigated how the online problem based learning (PBL)
   approach employed in an online learning environment influenced
   undergraduate students' critical thinking skills (CTS) and content
   knowledge acquisition. The pretest-posttest control group design was
   used in the study. The subjects included the students who were enrolled
   at the Department of Primary School Mathematics Teaching in Anadolu
   University Education Faculty. Subjects attended to Computer If course
   in 2008 spring. Experiment group attended the online PBL course whereas
   the control group attended the online instructor-led course. Each group
   consisted of 20 students. Data collection tools consisted of a multiple
   choice content knowledge acquisition scale and the Watson-Glaser
   critical thinking skills test. The results of two-way mixed design
   ANOVA indicated that learning in the online PBL group did not have a
   significant effect on the content knowledge acquisition scores. It was
   also revealed that learning in the online PBL group had a significant
   effect on increasing the critical thinking skills. (C) 2009 Elsevier

AB This paper compares the efficiency of two intelligent methods: expert
   systems and neural networks, in detecting children's mathematical gift
   at the fourth grade of elementary school. The input space for the
   expert system and the neural network model consisted of 60 variables
   describing five basic components of a child's mathematical gift
   identified in previous research. The expert system estimated a child's
   gift based on heuristically defined logic rules, while the
   scientifically confirmed psychological evaluation of gift based on
   Raven's standard progressive matrices was used at the output of neural
   network models. Three neural network algorithms were tested on a
   Croatian dataset. The results show that both the expert system and the
   neural network recognize more pupils as mathematically gifted than
   teachers do. The expert system produces the highest average hit rate,
   although the highest accuracy in classifying gifted children is
   obtained by the radial basis neural network algorithm, which also
   yields lower type II error. Due to the ability of expert systems to
   explain the result, it can be suggested that both the expert system and
   the neural network model have potential to serve as effective
   intelligent decision support tools in detecting mathematical gift in
   early stage, therefore enabling its further development. (C) 2009

AB Developing interactive history learning materials to facilitate
   historical thinking is one of the challenges in history teaching and
   learning. This study developed a web-based history educational system,
   which has used the acronym HES-SPATO (history educational system based
   on SPATO), to increase the under-standability of history learning
   materials. SPATO (spatial, person, action/attribute, and temporal
   object) was designed to integrate the indispensable elements of history
   events such as space, person, action/attribute, and time. HES-SPATO
   also applied temporal logic to reason the temporal relationships
   between history events. Furthermore, it employed the GIS concept of
   information layers to develop the student interface. The findings of
   the experiments indicated that the use of HES-SPATO was effective in
   enhancing students' history learning. The participants also showed
   positive attitudes toward the HES-SPATO system in terms of the
   perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude to use, intention
   to use, recall of web sites, and perceived usefulness of assistant
   tools. Although many functionalities have been added to the HES-SPATO
   system, there was no significant difference in system efficiency
   between HES-SPATO and the comparative system. These experimental
   results also guide the direction of future research. (C) 2009 Elsevier

AB While many reports espouse the potential impact that 3-D virtual worlds
   are expected to have on teaching and learning in higher education in a
   few years, there are few empirical studies that inform instructional
   design and learning assessment in virtual worlds. This study explores
   the nature and process of learning in Second Life in a graduate
   interdisciplinary communication course in fall 2007. Literature
   suggests that 3-D virtual worlds can be well suited for experiential
   learning environments. In this study, the actual instructional
   effectiveness of Second Life as an experiential learning environment
   for interdisciplinary communication is empirically examined using mixed
   research methods of journal content analysis, surveys, focus group, and
   virtual world snapshots and video. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB University classes in Mathematics are traditionally perceived to be
   uninspiring and devoid of active student-lecturer communication. Large
   undergraduate classes further compound the difficulty of engaging
   students and enabling viable student-lecturer feedback. At the
   Mathematics Education Centre, Loughborough University, some staff
   members have been using electronic voting systems (EVS) to enliven the
   classroom and enable large numbers of students to respond to questions
   in real time during class. In this paper, we present an evaluation case
   study, based on student perceptions, of the impact of EVS use on
   student learning and engagement. The results show that majority of
   students are hugely positive about the usefulness and overall
   advantageousness of EVS use in classes. Results also show that EVS use
   does increase the likelihood of students participating and engaging in
   class, as even students who do not view EVS as being particularly
   useful stated that they are more likely to participate in classes where
   EVS are used than otherwise. However, there seems to be no correlation
   between EVS use and improvement (or otherwise) in student grades. (C)

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING

DT Article
DE Agent; affordance; cognitive overload; modality; multiplicity; persona

ID EXAMPLES; STUDENTS; IMPACT
AB Animated pedagogical agents (APAs) are known to possess great potential
   in supporting learning because of their ability to simulate a real
   classroom learning environment. But research in this area has produced
   mixed results. The reason for this remains puzzling. This paper is
   written with two purposes: (1) to examine some recent research and
   organize the findings in terms of classroom characteristics, and (2) to
   discuss and reveal any uncovered issues pertaining to the findings and
   provide input whenever possible. A framework formed by using APA
   characteristics, APA presentation, and learners' characteristics is
   used to analyse past research findings. The findings from the analysis
   reveal that because APAs are regarded as social members similar to
   humans, they are more effective in engaging learners in environments
   that require social communication and interactions. They therefore
   produce more definitive results in terms of affective gain and group
   learning. But such conditions also impose greater demand on designers
   to create more complex learning environments that can provide
   interactions with several agents and yet maintain a mode of
   communication that is pedagogically effective. The challenges for
   creating such environment include using an agent's gestures to
   duplicate its speech in instruction, which is usually uncommon in human
   practice, overcoming the needs to use input-output interface for
   communication and taking into consideration the possible influence of
   the learners' characteristics such as their sensory preference. This
   paper suggests that APAs' application in instruction should be seen in
   the light of affordances and be designed within its own practical
   limits.

AB Making annotations on books and learning materials is part of students'

   systems, many people prefer to print digital documents and make
   annotations on physical paper. We introduce a classification scheme for
   computer-based annotation systems and provide an overview of different
   systems using this scheme. During our investigations, we identified
   several shortcomings in existing annotation systems: limitation to
   single document formats, no capturing of relations to reflect lateral
   reading, loss of context information an annotation was created in and
   limited sharing capabilities among collaborative users. To overcome
   these shortcomings, we introduce the concepts of Anchor Points,
   Artefacts and Spaces. Anchor Points define locations in arbitrary
   documents. Artefacts capture annotations on multiple Anchor Points in
   several documents, allowing students to map their current working
   context that typically contains several open documents and a
   relationship between them. Spaces are repositories for the learning
   materials and annotations that are automatically replicated among
   collaborative mobile users.

DE design for learning; inquiry-based learning; LAMS; Learning Activity
   Management System; students as designers
AB This paper explores the relationship between practitioners' pedagogical
   purposes, values and practices in designing for inquiry-based learning
   in higher education, and the affordances of the Learning Activity
   Management System (LAMS) as a tool for creating learning designs in
   this context. Using a qualitative research methodology, variation was
   identified in participants' conceptions of inquiry-based learning
   pedagogy and in their approaches to inquiry-based learning design. LAMS
   was found to offer design affordances that are compatible with more
   strongly teacher-led conceptions of, and approaches to, inquiry-based
   learning pedagogy. The paper draws some implications for the further
   development and use of design tools for inquiry-based learning. The
   authors suggest that, in addition to tools created for teachers, there
   may be a valuable role for tools that explicitly support students as
   designers of their own inquiry processes and activities.

AB The process of collaborative inquiry learning requires maintaining a
   mutual understanding of the task, along with reaching consensus on
   strategies, plans and domain knowledge. In this study, we explore how
   different supportive measures affect students' consensus-building
   process, based on a re-analysis of data from four studies. We
   distinguish between scaffolds that aim at supporting students'
   collaborative processes and scaffolds that aim primarily at supporting
   the inquiry learning process. The overall picture that emerges from the
   re-analysis is that integration-oriented consensus-building activities
   are facilitated by scaffolds that provide explicit instruction in rules
   for effective collaboration and by scaffolds that encourage students to
   collaboratively construct a representation. Scaffolds that display
   inter-individual differences between students' opinions resulted
   primarily in quick consensus-building activities.

AB This article is a methodological contribution to the use of design
   experiments in educational research. We will discuss the implications
   of a historical and situated interpretation to design experiments, the
   consequences this has for the analysis of the collected data and
   empirically based suggestions to improve the designs of the
   computer-based learning resources. This interpretation differs from
   that of the majority of other researchers who consider design
   experiments as fixed interventions. Our interpretation allows for an
   understanding of students' learning trajectories as part of the
   school's overall activities, which in turn has implications for
   suggestions regarding the improvement of computer-based learning
   resources. We develop argument in three different ways. First, we
   discuss our interpretation of design experiments and compare it with
   the dominant debate about design experiments as a methodological
   approach. Second, we discuss the implications this position has for
   interaction analysis methods. Finally, we empirically demonstrate this
   methodological implication by illustrating how vital it might be to
   consider data collected as part of design experiments as an element of
   a larger, established institutional setting characterized by inherent
   socio-cultural features. A conclusion that may be drawn from our
   situated interpretation of this design experiment is that, to improve
   students' knowledge constructions, it is not enough - nor is it in
   principle possible - to perfect the design of the technology. We also
   need to improve institutional aspects on how schools support students'
   knowledge constructions when using these technological tools, where the
   teacher's role in this work is invaluable. A historical and situated
   interpretation of design experiments provides insight into how these
   improvements may be made.

AB Emerging research has revealed the impact of electronic media usage on
   student outcomes, such as satisfaction and reported learning efficacy.
   However, little is known of its impact on measurable knowledge
   acquisition. Results from this study showed that participation on
   discussion topics through Blackboard, an electronic discussion forum,
   predicted multiple-choice test performance. In contrast, none of the
   traditional face-to-face feedback-seeking behaviours, neither with
   professors in class or out of class, nor among fellow students, had
   significant influence on test results. An examination of underlying
   attitudes driving both electronic and face-to-face feedback-seeking
   behaviours showed that competitiveness rather than cooperation drove
   average intensity of electronic board participation, which in turn, was
   related to participation across the number of electronic topical
   forums. The influencing role of competitiveness in this undergraduate
   student sample may indicate undergraduate students' lack of workplace
   experience, where cooperation rather than competition is often needed
   for workplace effectiveness. This and implications of other findings
   are discussed in the paper.

TI A project management perspective on student's declarative commitments

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING

   progression; student teams

AB Teamwork and technology, even as people are seeing their increased use
   in organizations, are becoming important components of problem-based
   learning in academic settings. Yet, fostering computer-assisted
   teamwork is complex and time consuming. Knowing how and when to
   intervene would prove useful. This study draws from the field of
   project management to explore how students commit to project goals
   using collective asynchronous text-based communication technology.
   Declarative commitments - goal-orientated public, voluntary, explicit
   and non-retractable messages comprised of a term, an objective and a
   focus - made by 34 teams during a four-phase 13-week project were
   analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative results show
   that declarative commitments voluntarily and formally package
   information about project constraints into a relatively potent message
   about tasks, coordination and project completion. Team members'
   suggestions as to what should be carried out in the project and
   requests for help often preceded others' declarative commitments. As
   with persuasive communication (i.e. aimed at changing beliefs,
   attitudes and behaviours), declarative commitments were followed by
   demands for clarification, new declarative commitments, confirmations
   of upheld commitments and clear approvals of what was committed to.
   Looking at project progression from a broader perspective, quantitative
   analyses show that declarative commitments did partially mediate the
   relationship between frequencies of task issues and of task solutions.
   This was particularly pronounced in the mid-point of the project, but
   it was not the case during the initial or final phases of the project.
   Taken together, these results suggest that teachers can facilitate
   computer-assisted learning and project goal attainment by monitoring
   asynchronous electronic discussions, and by eliciting and structuring
   declarative commitments.

TI ICT in Science Education: A quasi-experimental study of achievement,

   school students
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID GENDER-GAP; INSTRUCTION
AB The Seventh School Curriculum Reform in Korea was introduced in 2000 to
   prepare school-aged Koreans for an information and knowledge-based
   society. The reform effort emphasises information and communication
   technology (ICT) in the K-12 curriculum and a learner-centred pedagogy.
   This study examines the contributions of ICT, specifically,
   computer-assisted instruction (CAI), in Korean science classrooms. A
   sample of 234 Korean middle school students was categorised into five
   achievement groups. Data were collected from pre- and post-achievement
   test scores and pre- and post-questionnaires for attitudes toward
   science, future courses, and career aspirations in science. Findings
   include: (1) the lowest achievement group showed the most significant
   improvement after CAI (p=.000); (2) an improvement in student
   achievement in science significantly influenced students' attitudes
   toward science (p=.019), future course selections, and career
   aspirations related to science (p=.000); and (3) boys tended to perform
   better with CAI than girls. This research provides evidence that CAI
   has the potential to help lower achieving students in Korean science
   classes and may encourage enrolment in science.

AB This quasi-experimental study investigates how the classroom learning
   environment changed after inquiry-based activities were introduced and
   student questioning was encouraged. Three science teachers and three
   classes of fifth graders (n=92) participated in this study. The
   analysis of covariance reveals that although the experimental group
   students perceived that their teacher's support was significantly lower
   than that for the comparison group did (p 0.05), they were
   significantly more involved in learning (p 0.05) than their
   counterparts. Classroom observations of student questioning and inquiry
   activities revealed that those students with high quality levels in
   asking or responding to questions outperformed their counterparts in
   the inquiry ability of designing experimental procedures.

TI How Young Children Understand Electric Circuits: Prediction,
   explanation and exploration
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE
AB This paper reports findings from a study of young children's views
   about electric circuits. Twenty-eight children aged 5 and 6 years were
   interviewed. They were shown examples of circuits and asked to predict
   whether they would work and explain why. They were then invited to try
   out some of the circuit examples or make circuits of their own
   choosing. Children expressed a variety of views about the connections
   needed in a circuit, offered different kinds of explanation and showed
   differing levels of competence in circuit making. The range of
   responses showed similarities to those of older students found in
   previous research. The relationship between practical competence,
   prediction, and explanation was not straightforward. For example,
   children with similar levels of practical competence made different
   predictions or offered different kinds of explanation. Analysis of the
   circuits children chose to construct suggested influences of existing
   competence and knowledge. In particular, some children tested out
   circuit examples about which they had been unsure during the interview,
   while others explored circuit connections more generally. Findings
   underline the importance of drawing on a variety of evidence in
   assessing young children's understandings of electric circuits. They
   indicate that young children may offer views about electric circuits
   not unlike those of older children and adults with similar experience.
   Finally, there was some suggestion that the interview procedure may
   have acted as an instructive stimulus in helping children to become
   more conscious of their own views and reflect on their thinking in the
   light of further evidence.

ID SCIENCE; PHYSICS; EDUCATION; ILLUSION
AB Two independent lines of researchmental simulations and thought
   experimentsprovide strong arguments about the importance of perceptual
   modalities for the instructional practices in science education. By
   situating the use of mental simulations in the framework of thought
   experiments, this study investigated the nature and the role of mental
   simulations in the context of problem-solving. This study draws on data
   collected through problem-solving sessions with five physics graduates.
   Throughout the problem-solving sessions, think-aloud and retrospective
   questioning were used. Results from this study support some serious
   concerns put forward by several researchers in the community of science
   educators about high dependence on descriptive forms of scientific
   knowledge and exclusion of perceptual modalities from instructional
   practices. The participants' verbal reports confirmed that they had
   implicitly or explicitly reached a conclusion that mental simulations
   were not a legitimate way of reasoning about physics problems, and they
   consciously avoided the use of mental simulations. This
   conceptualization seemed to lead participants to compartmentalize
   mental simulations from formal physics knowledge. Therefore, mental
   simulations were not refined but kept in a primitive form, which was no
   more than a retrieval of perceptual representations constructed through
   observations and experiences of the world. The speculations on the
   results of the study were based on the interpretations of learning
   science in terms of the refinement and reorganizations of
   preinstructional ideas.

AB Little change has been noted over 10 years of research into teacher
   knowledge and confidence to teach science in the early and primary
   years of schooling. There is a significant body of research
   demonstrating that early childhood and primary teachers lack confidence
   and competence in teaching science. However, much of this research
   blames the victim, and offers little analysis for the systemic reasons
   for teachers' confidence and competence in science education other than
   a lack of science knowledge. This paper reports on a study that
   examined teacher philosophy and pedagogical practices within the
   context of an analysis of children's concept formation within playful
   early childhood settings. Through teacher interviews, video recordings
   of science play, and photographic documentation of children's science
   activities in one rural preschool, it was noted that teacher philosophy
   about how young children learn is a significant contributing factor to
   learning in science. It is argued that teacher philosophy makes more of
   a difference to children's scientific learning than does teacher
   confidence to teach science or knowledge of science. The study also
   shows that without a mediational scientific framework for using
   materials in play-based contexts, children will generate their own
   imaginary, often non-scientific, narratives for making sense of the
   materials provided.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine students' learning of simple
   machines, a fifth-grade (ages 10-11) forces and motion unit, and
   student engagement using a teacher-created Multiplayer Educational
   Gaming Application. This mixed-method study collected
   pre-test/post-test results to determine student knowledge about simple
   machines. A survey ascertained the time spent using the computer for
   general purposes, and the time spent playing computer games as a
   function of gender. The pre-test and post-test design involved 74
   students, 31 males and 43 females, who played the Dr. Friction
   Multiplayer Educational Gaming Application for several days in the
   middle of the unit. Results showed the females averaged using the
   computer more than their male counterparts and males played video games
   more than females. Analysis of covariance suggested no significant
   difference between the factor gender (p .05) but statistically
   significant differences in gain scores (p = .001). Observations and
   qualitative focus groups suggested high student engagement and how
   video game technology can scaffold learning of simple machines.

   STRATEGY; CLARITY; PHYSICS; LINK
AB In this paper we propose that the unpopularity of science in many
   industrialised countries is largely due to the gap between the
   subculture of science, on the one hand, and students' self-image, on
   the other. We conducted a study based on the self-to-prototype matching
   theory, testing whether the perceived mismatch between the typical
   representative of the science culture (the science prototype) and
   students' self-image is linked to not choosing science as a major.
   Fifty-four Dutch ninth-grade students currently choosing their subject
   majors (so-called profiles) completed a Dutch version of a
   questionnaire previously designed by Hannover and Kessels, which
   measures students' perceptions of typical peers favouring different
   school subjects (prototypes for physics, biology, economics, languages)
   and students' self-image. Students chose a profile to the extent that
   they conceived of themselves as similar to the typical peer who likes
   the key subject of that profile. Fifty per cent of variance was
   explained when using an aggregated science versus humanities distance
   score and predicting whether a student had chosen a science-related or
   a humanities-related profile. A comparison of Dutch students'
   description of the physics prototype with the German data from Hannover
   and Kessels revealed similar prototypes in both countries. The traits
   ascribed to the physics prototype were in line with science-related
   values and the culture of science as described by Merton and Traweek,
   for example. The relevance of the perceived fit of the culture of
   science to students' selves for academic choices is discussed.

AB The twenty-first century economy often requires the innovative
   production of conceptual and physical artifacts. These innovations
   frequently are developed collaboratively within communities of workers.
   Previous theories about the nature of work and learning within
   communities have emphasized shared meaning or shared practice, but now
   shared innovation is required. In this paper, I describe the
   development of a model for conceptualizing and studying shared
   innovation within communities. This model was created from merging
   elements of social learning and creativity/innovation theories. I
   explain that at an intersection of these two domains is a unique kind
   of social structure, called a Community of Innovation, or COI. I
   conclude by describing the characteristics of a COI and its
   implications for design and research.

AB This article reviews past empirical studies on the use of audio podcast
   (hereby referred to as podcast) in K-12 and higher education settings.
   Using the constant comparative method, this review is organized into
   three major research areas or topics: (a) participants' podcast usage
   profile, (b) effects of podcast on learners' outcomes, and (b)
   institutional aspects. Findings suggest that the most common use of
   podcasting is limited to either instructors distributing podcast
   recordings of lectures or supplementary materials for students to
   review subject material at their own time and place. A majority of the
   previous studies were descriptive, and were conducted in higher
   education and traditional course settings. Students generally enjoy
   using podcast, and tend to listen to the podcasts at home using desktop
   computers, rather than on the move (e.g., commuting to school) with a
   mobile device. Probably the main benefit of podcasting is that it
   allows students to listen to specific material that they missed or did
   not understand multiple times. The availability of podcast does not
   appear to encourage students to skip classes. We also discuss
   limitations of previous empirical studies, and provide some directions
   for future research related to the use of podcast in education settings.

AB Expertise in domains ranging from sports to surgery involves a process
   of recognition-primed decision-making (RPD) in which experts make
   rapid, intuitive decisions based on recognizing critical features of
   dynamic performance situations. While the development of expert RPD is
   assumed to require years of domain experience, the transition from
   competence to expertise may potentially be hastened by training that
   specifically targets the recognition aspect of RPD. This article
   describes a recognition training approach that is based on expertise
   theories, research findings, and laboratory measurement techniques.
   This approach repurposes laboratory research tasks as deliberate
   practice training tasks. Although pioneered in sports expertise
   research, this approach is appropriate for pre-service and in-service
   professionals in a wide range of domains that involve rapid,
   recognition-primed decision-making.

AB In this paper we describe the criteria of Technology I, II, and III,
   which some instructional theorists have proposed to describe the
   differences between a formulaic and a reflective approach to solving
   educational problems. In a recent study, we applied these criteria to
   find evidence of a technological gravity that pulls practitioners away
   from reflective practices into a more reductive approach. We compared
   published reports of an innovative instructional theory, problem-based
   learning, to the goals of the theory as it was originally defined. We
   found three reasons for technological gravity, as well as three
   approaches some practitioners have used to avoid this gravity. We
   recommend that instructional technologists adopt our three approaches,
   as well as the criteria of Technology III, so they may better develop
   instruction of a quality consistent with the innovative instructional
   principles they claim, and that best characterizes the goals they have
   for their practice.

AB This study investigated the effects of teacher, self and peer
   evaluation on preservice teachers' performance, knowledge and
   attitudes. Earlier research by the same authors revealed that students
   made significant improvements in their lesson plans under all three of
   these conditions, but the teacher-evaluation improved significantly
   more than the two student-evaluation groups. Therefore, relevant
   training and practice in the evaluation process were added in this
   study. All three groups made significant improvements from draft to
   final version of their plans, and the differences between the
   teacher-evaluation group and the two student-evaluation groups were
   non-significant. The authors attribute the stronger performance of the
   student-evaluation groups to their training on the evaluation task.
   Students' overall attitudes were significantly more positive toward
   teacher evaluation than toward peer evaluation, but did not differ
   significantly between these two groups and the self-evaluators. Several
   suggestions are discussed for further improvements in the training of
   self and peer evaluators.

AB This paper considers thought experiment as a special scientific tool
   that mediates between theory and experiment by mental simulation. To
   clarify the meaning of thought experiment, as required in teaching
   science, we followed the relevant episodes throughout the history of
   science paying attention to the epistemological status of the performed
   activity. A definition of thought experiment is suggested and its
   meaning is analyzed using two-dimensional conceptual variation. This
   method allows one to represent thought experiment in comparison with
   the congenerous conceptual constructs also defined. A similar approach
   is used to classify the uses of thought experiments, mainly for the
   purpose of science curriculum.

AB The standard textbook description of the nature of science describes
   the proposal, testing, and acceptance of a theoretical idea almost
   entirely in isolation from other theories. The resulting model of
   science is a kind of piecemeal empiricism that misses the important
   network structure of scientific knowledge. Only the large-scale
   description of scientific method can reveal the global
   interconnectedness of scientific knowledge that is an essential part of
   what makes science scientific.

AB The objective of this study is to facilitate progressive transitions in
   chemistry teachers understanding of nature of science in the context of
   historical controversies. Selected controversies referred to episodes
   that form part of the chemistry curriculum both at secondary and
   university freshman level. The study is based on 17 in-service teachers
   who had registered for an 11-week course on 'Investigation in the
   teaching of chemistry' as part of their Master's degree program. The
   course is based on 17 readings drawing on a history and philosophy of
   science perspective with special reference to controversial episodes in
   the chemistry curriculum. Course activities included written reports,
   class room discussions based on participants' presentations, and
   written exams. Based on the results obtained it is suggested that this
   study facilitated the following progressive transitions in teachers'
   understanding of nature of science: (a) Problematic nature of the
   scientific method, objectivity and the empirical basis of science; (b)
   Myths associated with respect to the nature of science and teaching
   chemistry; (c) Science does not develop by appealing to objectivity in
   an absolute sense, as creativity and presuppositions also play a
   crucial role; (d) The role of speculation and controversy in the
   construction of knowledge based on episodes from the chemistry
   curriculum; (e) How did Bohr confirm his postulates? This goes beyond
   the treatment in most textbooks; (f) Differentiation between the
   idealized scientific law and the observations. It is concluded that
   given the opportunity to reflect, discuss and participate in a series
   of course activities based on various controversial episodes, teachers'
   understanding of nature of science can be enhanced.

AB The purpose of this study is to analyze variations in how the gene
   concept is used and conceived in different sub-disciplines in biology.
   An examination of the development of subject matter and the use of the
   gene concept in a common college biology textbook shows that the gene
   concept is far from presented in a consistent way. The study describes
   and categorizes five different gene concepts used in the textbook; the
   gene as a trait, an information-structure, an actor, a regulator and a
   marker. These conceptual differences are not dealt with in an explicit
   manner. This constitutes one of the sources for confusion when learning
   about genes and genetics.

AB Interviews with key scientists who had conducted research on Severe
   Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), together with analysis of media
   reports, documentaries and other literature published during and after
   the SARS epidemic, revealed many interesting aspects of the nature of
   science (NOS) and scientific inquiry in contemporary scientific
   research in the rapidly growing field of molecular biology. The story
   of SARS illustrates vividly some NOS features advocated in the school
   science curriculum, including the tentative nature of scientific
   knowledge, theory-laden observation and interpretation, multiplicity of
   approaches adopted in scientific inquiry, the inter-relationship
   between science and technology, and the nexus of science, politics,
   social and cultural practices. The story also provided some insights
   into a number of NOS features less emphasised in the school
   curriculum-for example, the need to combine and coordinate expertise in
   a number of scientific fields, the intense competition between research
   groups (suspended during the SARS crisis), the significance of
   affective issues relating to intellectual honesty and the courage to
   challenge authority, the pressure of funding issues on the conduct of
   research and the 'peace of mind' of researchers, These less emphasised
   elements provided empirical evidence that NOS knowledge, like
   scientific knowledge itself, changes over time. They reflected the need
   for teachers and curriculum planners to revisit and reconsider whether
   the features of NOS currently included in the school science curriculum
   are fully reflective of the practice of science in the 21st century. In
   this paper, we also report on how we made use of extracts from the news
   reports and documentaries on SARS, together with episodes from the
   scientists' interviews, to develop a multimedia instructional package
   for explicitly teaching the prominent features of NOS and scientific
   inquiry identified in the SARS research.

TI On the Hypothetico-Deductive Nature of Science-Darwin's Finches
SO SCIENCE & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Allchin (2006) has misinterpreted a classic case of
   hypothetico-deductive (HD) science in terms of his preferred
   'let's-gather-some-data-and-see-what-emerges' view. The
   misrepresentation concerns the research program of Peter and Rosemary
   Grant on Darwin's finches. The present essay argues that the Grants'
   research is HD in nature and includes a statement by Peter Grant to
   that effect.
   There was no doubt that atoms could explain some puzzling phenomena.
   But in truth they were merely one man's daydreams. Atoms, if they
   really existed, were far too small to be perceived directly by the
   senses. How then would it ever be possible to establish their reality?
   Fortunately, there was a way. The trick was to assume that atoms
   existed, then deduce a logical consequence of this assumption for the
   everyday world. If the consequence matched reality, then the idea of
   atoms was given a boost. If not, then it was time to look for a better
   idea.

ID CONCEPTUAL CHANGE
AB This paper analyzes the most significant events occurring in Brazil's
   educational, social and political areas over the last half century,
   viewed against a background of relevant worldwide events. The
   hypothesis presented here is that the relations between the country's
   educational policies, the demands of the various segments of academia,
   and the public school system have always been strained. This strain has
   contributed positively to the evolution of academic knowledge and
   production, to the design of more modern curricular projects by
   institutional authorities, and to the initial recognition of the
   specific construction of school knowledge by the school system itself.
   However, the interaction of these major institutions lacks a crucial
   element-one that would lead to an effective change in the education of
   science teachers and produce a positive impact on Brazil's
   schools-namely, the wholehearted participation of science teachers
   themselves. With this analysis, we intend to contribute by offering
   some perspectives and proposals for science teacher education in Brazil.

AB This paper is an analysis of inserting history and philosophy of

   university. It is an examination of the approaches and methodologies
   adopted by professors of a History and Epistemology course. The course
   aims to have an explicit approach to HPS. The results suggest a concern
   of the Physics Institute regarding inserting these questions into
   physics teacher training programs. The study also uncovered that the
   professors who taught the subject had different visions of HPS.

AB This paper considers George A. Reisch's account of the role of Cold War
   political forces in shaping the apolitical stance that came to dominate
   philosophy of science in the late 1940s and 1950s. It argues that at
   least as early as the 1930s, Logical Empiricists such as Rudolf Carnap
   already held that philosophy of science could not properly have
   political aims, and further suggests that political forces alone cannot
   explain this view's rise to dominance during the Cold War, since
   political forces cannot explain why a philosophy of science with
   liberal democratic, anti-communist aims did not flourish. The paper
   then argues that if professionalization is understood in the right way,
   it might point toward an explanation of the apolitical stance of Cold
   War philosophy of science.

TI The Emergence of 3D Geometry From Children's (Teacher-Guided)
   Classification Tasks
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID KNOWLEDGE; MATHEMATICS; COGNITION; REPAIR; VIEW
AB Geometry, classification, and the classification of geometrical objects
   are integral aspects of recent curriculum documents in mathematics
   education. Such curriculum documents, however, leave open how the work
   of classifying objects according to geometrical properties can be
   accomplished given that the knowledge of these properties is the
   planned outcome of the curriculum or lesson. The fundamental question
   of the present study therefore is this: How can a lesson in which
   children are asked to participate in a task of classifying regular
   3-dimensional objects be a geometry lesson, given that the
   participating 2nd-grade children do not yet classify according to
   geometrical properties (predicates)? In our analyses, which are
   inspired by ethno-methodological studies of work, we focus on the
   embodied and collective work that leads to the emergence of the
   geometrical nature of this lesson. Thus, we report both the collective
   and the individual work by means of which the lesson outcomes-the
   complete classification of a set of "mystery" objects according to
   geometrical (shape) rather than other (color, size, "pointy-ness")
   properties-are achieved. In the process, our study shows how
   geometrical work is reproduced by 2nd-grade children who, in a division
   of labor with their teachers, produce a particular set of geometrical
   practices (sorting three-dimensional objects according to their
   geometrical properties) for the 1st time.

TI Participants' Roles in the Context of a Video Club
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES

DT Article
ID PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; TEACHER COMMUNITY; MATHEMATICS; KNOWLEDGE;
   REFORM
AB This study examines the nature of teacher participation in the context
   of a video club. Video clubs are professional development meetings in
   which teachers watch and discuss excerpts of video from their
   classrooms. In this study, I adopt a situative perspective to examine
   how teachers develop in their participation to accomplish the goals of
   the video club. In particular, I examine the roles participants play
   and explore teachers' participation in four roles that correspond with
   key goals of the video club. Analysis revealed that teachers'
   participation shifted in qualitatively different ways over time, with
   the teachers coming to prompt the group to discuss student mathematical
   thinking, to propose a variety of interpretations of student ideas, to
   build on one another's ideas, and to challenge one another's thinking
   in order to advance the group's conversations. This analysis suggests
   that the group learned how to participate in roles central to
   accomplishing the goals of the video club. Studying teacher learning
   through a lens of participation provides insight into the ways in which
   teachers coordinate themselves to engage with the goals of professional
   development and has implications for designing professional development
   that helps teachers develop practices for teaching mathematics for
   understanding.

TI Defining Personal Epistemology: A Response to Hofer & Pintrich (1997)
   and Sandoval (2005)
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID PHYSICS STUDENTS LEARN; INTRODUCTORY PHYSICS; RESOURCES; KNOWLEDGE;
   BELIEFS
AB Some researchers, including B. K. Hofer and P. R. Pintrich (1997) and
   W. A. Sandoval (2005), argue for defining personal epistemology as
   views about the nature of knowledge and knowing but not views about the
   nature of learning. Others continue using a more expansive definition
   of personal epistemology that includes views about learning. I argue
   that the scope of personal epistemology should not be decided entirely
   a priori. If people's views about the nature of knowing and knowledge
   turn out to be separable from (despite being intertwined with) their
   views about the nature of learning, then it makes sense to define 2
   separate areas of study corresponding to those 2 separable sets of
   psychological constructs. From some theoretical perspectives, however,
   empirical results may support the interpretation that views about
   knowledge are inseparably entangled with views about learning. In that
   case, excluding views about learning from personal epistemology
   obscures rather than elucidates the content and cognitive structure of
   students' views. To be clear, I do not think the community should
   decide, now, to etch "views about the nature of learning" into the
   definition of personal epistemology. I argue instead that it is more
   productive not to converge on a definition until further empirical and
   theoretical progress points us toward the bestway to "cut up [nature]
   ... along its natural joints" (Plato, 1995, p. 64).

TI In Defense of Clarity in the Study of Personal Epistemology
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID KNOWLEDGE; RESOURCES; BELIEFS; SCIENCE
AB Andrew Elby (this issue) argues that researchers in the field of
   personal epistemology should beware insistence on a narrow definition
   of epistemology to guide this work. His argument is a response to
   suggestions (Hofer & Pintrich, 1997; Sandoval, 2005) that the study of
   personal epistemology should focus on people's views about knowledge
   and knowing and not conflate those with views about learning. His main
   concern is that learners' views about knowledge and their views about
   learning may, in fact, be conflated and that an insistence on
   definitional clarity could lead to a mischaracterization of cognitive
   structures. In this response I argue that clarity in the definition of
   theoretical constructs does not imply exclusion of views about learning
   from the study of personal epistemology. Furthermore, given the history
   of this area of research, failing to more clearly define our constructs
   makes real theoretical progress difficult.

ID SCIENCE; INQUIRY; PARTICIPATION; PROGRAM; IMPACT
AB Many science educators encourage Student experiences of "authentic"
   science by means of student participation in science-related
   workplaces. Little research has been done. however, to investigate how
   "teaching" naturally occurs in such settings, where scientists or
   technicians normally do not have pedagogical training and generally do
   not have time (or value) receiving such training. This study examines
   how laboratory members without a pedagogical background or experience
   in teaching engage high School Students during their internship
   activities. Drawing oil conversation analysis, we analyze the
   minute-by-minute transactions that occurred while high school students
   participated in a leading environmental science laboratory. We find
   that the participation trajectory was based oil
   demonstration-practice-connect (D-P-C) phases that Continually recurred
   in the process of "doing" science. Concerning the transactional
   structures, we identify two basic conversation
   patterns-Initiate-Clarify-Reply (I-C-R) and
   Initiate-Reply-Clarify-Reply (I-R-C-R)-that do not only differ from the
   well-known Initiate-Reply-Evaluate (I-R-E) patterns previously observed
   in science classrooms, bill also could be combined to constitute more
   complex patterns. Willi respect to the organization of natural
   pedagogical conversations, we find that there were not only of
   preferred and dispreferred modes of responding but also ambiguous
   dispreferred modes; and the formulating organization not only includes
   self-formulating but also other-formulating, These natural pedagogical
   conversations helped, on the one hand, students to clarify their
   understanding and, on the other hand. technicians (or teachers) to
   leach toward different needs for different students in different
   contexts. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 46: 491-505,

AB This study investigated students' with visual impairment concepts about
   linear size and scale. Specifically the study examined the accuracy of
   students' concepts over many orders of magnitude as well as experiences
   students have had in and out-of-school learning about size and scale.
   The results of assessments of 17 students with visual impairment were
   compared to those of students with normal sight. The study showed that
   students with visual impairment were most accurate for measurements in
   the human scale and were least accurate with very large and very small
   scales that cannot be directly experienced. However, when compared to
   students with normal sight, students with visual impairment were more
   accurate at large and small scales than their normally sighted peers.

AB We investigated students' knowledge constructions of basic quantum
   chemistry concepts, namely atomic orbitals, the Schrodinger equation,
   molecular orbitals, hybridization, and chemical bonding. Ausubel's
   theory of meaningful learning provided the theoretical framework and
   phenomenography the method of analysis. The semistructured interview
   with 19 second-year chemistry students supplied the data. We identified
   four levels of explanations in the students' answers. In addition, the
   scientific knowledge claims reflected three main levels of models. By
   combining levels of explanations with levels of models, we derived four
   categories. Two of the categories are shades of variation in the
   rote-learning part of a continuum, while the other two categories are
   in the meaningful-learning part. All students possessed alternative
   conceptions some of which Occurred within certain categories, while
   others spanned more categories. The insistence on the deterministic
   models of the atom, the misinterpretation of models, and the poor
   understanding of the current quantum concepts are main problems in the
   learning of the basic quantum chemistry concepts. (C) 2009 Wiley

AB This study investigates Turkish students' knowledge structure coherence
   in physics. In particular, this study investigates the conflicting
   findings reported in loannides and Vosniadou's [loannides and Vosniadou
   [2002] Cognitive Science Quarterly, 2, 5-61] and diSessa, Gillespie,
   and Esterly's [diSessa et al. [2004] Cognitive Science, 28, 843-900]
   studies about students' understandings of force. loannides and
   Vosniadou's study of four different age levels of students in Greece
   demonstrated broad consistency in students' understandings of force.
   diSessa and colleagues' quasi-replication in the United States
   demonstrated conflicting results supporting a more fragmented elemental
   perspective on students' knowledge structure coherence. The current
   study investigates these conflicting findings by studying students in a
   third country using the analytic methods from both studies to clarify
   the debate over knowledge structure coherence. The levels of
   consistency demonstrated by students in the Current study are somewhat
   higher than the levels reported by diSessa. Gillespie, and Esterly
   according to both coding schemes, but are closer overall to the levels
   reported by diSessa, Gillespie, and Esterly than to the levels reported
   by loannides and Vosniadou. In addition, closer inspection of students'
   explanations suggests that students' explanations may code as
   consistent according to the coding schemes for a particular force
   meaning category but not actually represent a coherent understanding of
   that force meaning. These results therefore more closely support
   fragmented elemental perspectives on knowledge structure coherence. The
   results, however, demonstrate important systematicities in students'
   thinking and support the possibility that differences between the
   student populations in the countries of the original studies
   contributed to the differences in findings of the original studies. (C)

AB This experimental study investigated whether computer-based video games
   facilitate children's cognitive learning. In comparison to traditional
   computer-assisted instruction (CAI), this study explored the impact of
   the varied types of instructional delivery strategies on children's
   learning achievement. One major research null hypothesis was tested:
   there are no statistically significant differences in students'
   achievement when they receive two different instructional treatments:
   (1) traditional CAI; and (2) a computer-based video game. One hundred
   and eight third-graders from a middle/high socio-economic standard
   school district in Taiwan participated in the study. Results indicate
   that computer-based video game playing not only improves participants'
   fact/recall processes (F = 5.288, p < .05), but also promotes
   problem-solving skills by recognizing multiple solutions for problems
   (F = 5.656, p < .05).

AB Using the theories of critical reflection and community of practice,
   the aim of this paper was to explore the use of blogs as a reflective
   platform in the training processes of English as a Foreign Language
   (EFL) student teachers, who were learning to teach English for future
   employment in Taiwan. They made use of blogs as a platform to
   critically reflect on their learning processes as well as to gauge the
   impact of blogs on their own professional growth. Forty-three student
   teachers in two teacher-education programs at two science and
   technology institutions in central Taiwan participated in this study.
   Two instructors created a blog for use as a discussion forum so that
   the student teachers could engage in and examine their own reflection
   process. The data collected was qualitative in nature, consisting of
   student teachers' posting messages and comments on the blog, surveys on
   the student teachers' reflective experiences using blogs as reflection
   tools, and group reflective dialogues recorded by instructors in class
   meetings over the implementation of blogs during the course. The
   results showed that the student teachers actively discussed teaching
   theories and their implications through blogs. All of the 43 teachers
   who took part in this study were reflective, and some critically
   reflected on their thoughts and made significant comments; and the
   participants considered technology a useful platform for reflecting and
   communicating with each other. The positive implications for the use of
   blogs as a medium to provide and promote critical reflection for EFL
   teachers are discussed.

AB Most courses based on distance learning focus on the cognitive domain
   of learning. Because students are sometimes inattentive or tired, they
   may neglect the attention goal of learning. This study proposes an
   auto-detection and reinforcement mechanism for the distance-education
   system based on the reinforcement teaching strategy. If a student is
   detected to be inattentive or fatigued, then the alert reinforcement
   feedback window is given; if the attentive time in learning has been
   reached, then encouraging reinforcement feedback is given. In distance
   education, the teacher could maintain the learning quality of students
   through this mechanism. Results of the simulative test and class
   experiment indicate that this mechanism detects the behavior of
   students with high accuracy. In other words, it can accurately identify
   learners who are inattentive or fatigued. The proposed mechanism can
   urge the inattentive learners to achieve the Attending Teaching goal,
   according to a comparison of results before and after the experimental
   class obtained from questionnaires and interviews. However, we also
   found that the mechanism could not effectively alleviate mental fatigue
   resulting from physiological exhaustion. Thus, students who feel
   fatigued must be required to learn in a better mental state to avoid
   wasting time and learning without satisfying effects. This work
   presents a detection reinforcement mechanism and teaching procedure
   designed from the perspective of an Affective Domain Teaching
   Objectives. The proposed mechanism can accurately detect
   inattentiveness in students, thus helping teachers of distance
   education courses to handle the students' learning conditions.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the instructional
   effectiveness of different online reading strategies for students
   identified as possessing different learning styles, either internal or
   external locus of control styles, on tests measuring different learning
   objectives. Participants were 169 undergraduate students, randomly
   assigned to four online reading treatments: none, rereading strategy,
   keyword strategy, and question and answer strategy. Immediately after
   interacting with their respective instructions, students received four
   individual criterion measures. Analyses indicated an insignificant
   interaction between learning style and treatment type; however,
   comprehension tests reflect a significant main effect for students
   receiving the online rereading treatment (F = 3.09, df = 3/169, p =
   .03), with an effect size of .40. The rereading treatment also appears
   to be significantly more effective than the control for the
   comprehension test. Results indicate that not all types of reading
   strategies are equally effective in facilitating different types of
   learning objectives. The results indicate that, even though different
   reading strategies may be structurally different, they are functionally
   identical for raising questions relative to the cost and amount of time
   required for student interaction.

AB Mobile learning (m-learning) is a new trend in the e-learning field.
   The learning services in m-learning environments are supported by
   fundamental functions, especially the content and assessment services,
   which need an authoring tool to rapidly generate adaptable learning
   resources. To fulfill the imperious demand, this study proposes an
   authoring tool named Mobile E-learning Authoring Tool (MEAT) to produce
   adaptable learning contents and test items. In addition, the visualized
   course organization tool has also been provided to teachers to organize
   their teaching courses. All functionalities of the MEAT are designed
   according to the teachers' feedback and their technological learning
   needs. To evaluate the MEAT, we have conducted an extensive comparison
   between the MEAT and other (adaptation) content authoring tools. The
   result indicates the MEAT is the only tool, which can produce adaptable
   contents and test items while supporting learning standard. In addition
   to technical comparison, the qualitative feedbacks from teachers and
   students are also shown in the evaluation section, and result points
   out the advantages and shortcomings of the MEAT. According to our
   findings, we have summarized some design principles for readers who are
   interested in designing e-learning applications. It hopes our precious
   experiences can inspire readers to develop more valuable learning tools.

ID PORTFOLIO ASSESSMENT
AB If students cannot express themselves in the language of the assessor,
   and if the assessor is not familiar with the cultural constraints
   within which students operate, it is difficult for the assessor to
   collect evidence of adequate performance. This article describes the
   assessment of three digital artefacts where the assessor strove to
   understand, rather than rate the students and their achievement. Three
   distinct approaches were followed. The first was positivist,
   rubric-based. The second was post-structural/interpretive, with
   groupwork and peer assessment. The third was feminist/holistic relying
   principally on students' own presentation of video material of what
   they did. Data sources include artifacts produced by students,
   assessment rubrics and assessment scores. Results indicate that
   qualitative assessment with criteria negotiated between the
   instructor/assessor, the twelve learners and their peers over a period
   of two years, allowed for a 'thick description' of the evaluation
   experience that adds to student development. Further research needs to
   be conducted into standardizing the procedures of auditing assessments,
   rather than standardizing procedures of assessing.

AB Pre-service teachers' perceptions of their own learning are important
   to the ways they integrate technology into their practices. Therefore,
   the purpose of this study was to examine the pre-service teachers'
   perspectives of asynchronous discussion board (ADB) as a tool of
   learning to teach. ADB was integrated into two literacy courses for 33
   pre-service teachers over 16 weeks. Data were collected through oral
   interviews, written reflections, and participants' postings on the
   discussion board. The data were analyzed using Chi's (1997) framework
   of verbal analysis method. The findings indicated that the participants
   perceived ADB as an important tool of learning to teach because it
   promoted situated learning, facilitated a social construction of
   knowledge, and afforded customized learning experiences.

AB This study presents the results of the examination of the use of
   technology to enhance the capstone portfolio process for teacher
   candidates completing a master's degree at a small regional campus in
   Northwest Ohio, United States. Students at this institution complete a
   fifth year program that results in a master's degree and a
   recommendation for an Early or Middle Childhood license. The study
   focuses on determining the effectiveness of using a web-based
   portfolio. Teacher candidates' perceived knowledge, skills and
   dispositions about technology literacy and usage in developing an
   e-portfolio are measured by comparing a pre and post survey. Results
   indicate a stronger knowledge and skill base concerning technology use
   and state standards, as well as a better disposition towards utilizing
   technology for creating and maintaining portfolios.

AB The evaluation of intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) is an important
   though often neglected stage of ITS development. There are many
   evaluation methods available but literature does not provide clear
   guidelines for the selection of evaluation method(s) to be used in a
   particular context. This paper describes the evaluation study of
   DEPTHS, an intelligent tutoring system for learning software design
   patterns. The study which took place during the spring semester 2006
   was aimed at assessing the system's effectiveness and the accuracy of
   the applied student model. It also targeted the evaluation of the
   students' subjective experiences with the system.

AB Today's students were born into a world of digital technology. We
   investigated the impact of computers and the Internet on the learning
   preferences of students whose schools do not use this technology in
   class, specifically, (a) the usability they attributed to the
   technology for tasks requiring the processing of information; and (b)
   their attitude towards the technology in relation to their attitude
   towards the type of learning used in school. Our focus was the history
   class. To this end, surveys were filled out by three different classes
   that do not use computers in school: one in a high school that
   advocates beyond-information activities and two in information-focused
   public (i.e., state) schools-a high school and a middle school. These
   attitudes were found to be negatively correlated with the legitimacy
   ascribed to the form of learning used in school. Specifically, the two
   public-school classes used digital technology in the belief that they
   knew better than their teacher how to pursue a school
   information-focused agenda, whereas the third class legitimized the
   form of learning used in school. In neither case, however, was there
   any indication of a fertile human-computer partnership, envisioned as
   the desired form of learning for the digital age.

TI A Markov-based Recommendation Model for Exploring the Transfer of
   Learning on the Web
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE Groups-learning paths; Transfer of learning; Markov chain model;
   Individual learning; Entropy
AB The ability to apply existing knowledge in new situations and settings
   is clearly a vital skill that all students need to develop. Nowhere is
   this truer than in the rapidly developing world of Web-based learning,
   which is characterized by non-sequential courses and the absence of an
   effective cross-subject guidance system. As a result, questions have
   arisen about how to best explore and stimulate the transfer of learning
   from one subject to another in electronically mediated courses of
   study. In this study, we argue that online learners would benefit from
   guidance along applicable group-learning paths. This paper proposes use
   of the learning sequence recommendation system (LSRS) to help learners
   achieve effective Web-based learning transfer using recommendations
   based on group-learning paths. We begin with a Markov chain model,
   which is a probability transition model, to accumulate transition
   probabilities among learning objects in a course of study. We further
   employ an entropy-based approach to assist this model in discovering
   one or more recommended learning paths through the course material.
   Statistical results showed that the proposed approach can provide
   students with dependable paths leading to higher achievement levels,
   both in terms of knowledge acquisition and integration, than those
   typically attained in more traditional learning environments. Our study
   also identified benefits for teachers, providing them with ideas and
   tools needed to design better online courses. Thus, our study points
   the way to a Web-based learning transfer model that enables teachers to
   refine the quality of their instruction and equips students with the
   tools to enhance the breadth and depth of their education.

AB With the gradual adoption of "Web 2.0" technologies, one of key Web 2.0
   technologies, blog, has become a popular and wide-accepted Web
   application. Although mobile device users can access the Web whenever
   or wherever the need arises, there is not an easy way to publish their
   thoughts and experiences via blog articles. In this study, we offer a
   solution by designing a mobile blogging system which enables mobile
   bloggers to publish their comments in authentic context anytime and
   anywhere. We show that with the help of the mobile blogging system, we
   can establish a collaborative learning model for students in virtual
   classrooms. The results revealed from the learning outcome are positive
   and encouraging regarding the effectiveness of the supported
   collaborative learning model. In the conclusions, we discuss the
   findings and applications of the proposed system in collaborative

AB Using emotion detection technologies from biophysical signals, this
   study explored how emotion evolves during learning process and how
   emotion feedback could be used to improve learning experiences. This
   article also described a cutting-edge pervasive e-Learning platform
   used in a Shanghai online college and proposed an affective e-Learning
   model, which combined learners' emotions with the Shanghai e-Learning
   platform. The study was guided by Russell's circumplex model of affect
   and Kort's learning spiral model. The results about emotion recognition
   from physiological signals achieved a best-case accuracy (86.3%) for
   four types of learning emotions. And results from emotion revolution
   study showed that engagement and confusion were the most important and
   frequently occurred emotions in learning, which is consistent with the
   findings from AutoTutor project. No evidence from this study validated
   Kort's learning spiral model. An experimental prototype of the
   affective e-Learning model was built to help improve students' learning
   experience by customizing learning material delivery based on students'
   emotional state. Experiments indicated the superiority of emotion aware
   over non-emotion-aware with a performance increase of 91%.

AB This paper reports our implementation and evaluation of a wireless
   handheld learning environment used to support a clinical nursing
   practicum course. The learning environment was designed so that nursing
   students could use handhelds for recording information, organizing
   ideas, assessing patients, and also for interaction and collaboration
   with peers during an on-site clinical practicum. Our wireless handheld
   learning environment was field tested during a three-week practicum
   session. Analysis of data showed that both the instructor and the
   student benefited from using the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)
   environment. The handhelds not only provided students with scaffolds to
   enhance learning but also facilitated peer cooperation and interaction
   with the instructor. Issues resulted from our implementation included
   things like the capacity of handhelds, network access, and
   participants' preconceptions on using PC-based systems.

AB Students can practice skills and acquire knowledge by doing coursework.
   However, in conventional coursework activities, each student is
   assigned the same exercises, without considering learners' diversity.
   Moreover, students typically have difficulty in receiving assistance
   for completing their exercises after class. Therefore, some students
   cannot learn effectively when doing their coursework. This work
   presents a Web Coursework Support System (WCSS) to assist students
   doing coursework within their Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). This
   system applies decision tree analysis methodology for selecting
   programming exercises at a level of difficulty suited to each student.
   The assigned exercises thus challenge students. To assist students in
   completing these assigned exercises, this system allows students to
   access distributed online learning materials related to a programming
   concept through links on a single web page and motivates students to
   answer posted questions in a discussion forum. Experimental results
   show that the exercises-completed rate and the rate of the assigned
   exercises completed with assistance were increased. They indicate that
   WCSS can increase likelihood that students do coursework within their
   ZPD by offering challenges and assistance. Furthermore, some students'
   responses were insightful in understanding the benefits and limitations
   of this system.

ID COGNITION
AB Theory of distributed cognition unveils the answer to what constitute
   distributed cognition. However, how the distributed cognition in
   web-based learning environment spreads out still remains a black box.
   This study sought to deepen our understanding on how learners'
   knowledge disseminates online by examining the impacts of three kinds
   of communication, namely intra-action, interaction, and outeraction.
   This paper conducted a quasi-experimental study and invited 135
   Taiwanese college students to help us explore our attempted research
   question. The results clearly demonstrated that intra-action has
   stronger relationship with learning outcomes than interaction or
   outeraction. In addition, considerable correlation was detected between
   intra-action and interaction. Subsequent interviews with learners
   indicated that considerable part of the positive relationship between
   intra-action and learning achievement may be due to cause-effect,
   namely, intra-action activities are perceived by learners as
   contributing to positive learning outcomes. In sum, this study
   contributes to the literature because (a) we extend previous research
   on distributed cognition by examining the impacts of three kinds of
   communication; (b) we suggest it is worthwhile for researchers to
   further study the impact of intra-action; (c) by distinguishing the
   three communications, we introduce one way that can measure status of
   the constituent elements of distributed cognition that exists in a
   distance learning environment.

AB A number of studies emphasized the need to capture learners'
   interaction patterns in order to personalize their learning process as
   they study through learning objects. In education context, learning
   materials are designed based on pre-determined expectations and
   learners are evaluated to what extent they master these expectations.
   Representation of these expectations in learning and assessment
   objects, on the other hand, is a new challenge for e-learner providers.
   In order to address this challenge, POLEonto (Personlized Ontological
   Learning Environment) proposes a new method to separate these
   expectations by determining domain concepts (ConceptNet) and cognitive
   skills (CogSkillNet) for expectations via creating cognitive skill and
   concept ontology for K-12 education. In this paper, we report only the
   development and design processes of CogSkillNet within POLEonto
   environment; and, we further discuss how CogSkillNet can be modeled in
   the e-learning domain. We also describe how ontological representations
   play a role in creating personalized navigational guidance for allowing
   visualization of cognitive skills and providing useful navigational
   feedback to learners.

AB This study was conducted in the Faculty of Creative Multimedia,
   Multimedia University, Malaysia and investigated students' perceptions
   while working on a multimedia project that was embedded within a
   constructivist-based learning environment. We studied the impact of
   using multimedia on students who have little experience with working in
   a problem-solving design environment. Students worked in groups and
   created an interactive multimedia application with Macromedia Director.
   They were responsible for all project development decisions during
   their learning process. A survey questionnaire administered at the end
   of the project captured their perceptions. The students showed positive
   attitudes towards the project with respect to their learning motivation
   and understanding, skills and their teamwork abilities. By
   incorporating multimedia into a constructivist learning environment,
   students learned to design multimedia, as well as to experience
   critical-thinking, creative, presentation and communication skills;
   enhanced motivation and understanding various levels of the subject
   domain. These skills would all be useful in their future undertakings.
   Our findings provide strong support and encouragement for Malaysian
   educators to incorporate multimedia technology and constructivist
   learning into the classrooms for the enhancement of teaching and
   learning.

TI Comparing Learning Performance of Students Using Algorithm

DE Algorithm visualization; Algorithm simulation; collaborative learning;
   Engagement taxonomy
AB In this paper, two emerging learning and teaching methods have been
   studied: collaboration in concert with algorithm visualization. When
   visualizations have been employed in collaborative learning,
   collaboration introduces new challenges for the visualization tools. In
   addition, new theories are needed to guide the development and research
   of the visualization tools for collaborative learning. We present an
   empirical study, in which learning materials containing visualizations
   on different Extended Engagement Taxonomy levels were compared, when
   students were collaboratively learning concepts related to binary heap.
   In addition, the students' activities during the controlled
   experimental study were also recorded utilizing a screen capturing
   software. Pre- and post-tests were used as the test instruments in the
   experiment. No statistically significant differences were found in the
   post-test between the randomized groups. However, screen capturing and
   voice recording revealed that despite the randomization and
   instructions given to the students, not all of the students performed
   on the engagement level, to which they were assigned. By regrouping the
   students based on the monitored behavior, statistically significant
   differences were found in the total and pair average of the post-test
   scores. This confirms some of the hypothesis presented in the
   (Extended) Engagement Taxonomy.

DE Reading strategy; Feedback tool; Trace result; Comprehension
   monitoring; Reading comprehension
AB The purpose of this study is to examine readers' comprehension as they
   develop their mental representation of reference in four sequential
   online texts. A total of 92 college students from three reading classes
   were recruited to complete the following steps in each text: (1)
   identify references, (2) draw the relationships between references, and
   (3) answer reading comprehension test items. Results of this study
   showed that the correlation between referential resolution and reading
   comprehension tests ranged from .68 to .90 in four online texts. This
   indicated that when readers' scores in referential resolution
   increased, their scores in reading comprehension tests were also
   raised. Among three groups of readers, the more-proficient readers were
   able to integrate the references in different parts of the text as a
   coherent network from text 1 to 4. In contrast, average and
   less-proficient readers initially did not integrate any reference when
   reading the first text. They eventually clustered different references
   and referred them to a correct subject in the final text. The keys to
   the development of college readers' mental representation of reference
   lay in whether they were actively engaged in comprehension monitoring
   and frequently asked for feedback tool as a scaffold.

AB The authors investigated the relationship between type of group
   supervision (hybrid model vs. face-to-face) and attitudes toward
   technology, toward use of technology in professional practice, and
   toward quality of supervision among a sample of school counseling
   interns. Participants (N = 76) experienced one of two types of
   internship supervision: a hybrid model (N = 41) or face-to-face (N=
   35). Data analyses indicated that the hybrid model of group supervision
   was positively related to attitudes toward technology in counselor
   education, future professional practice, and the overall supervisory
   experience. Further, differences between the approaches in delivery of
   supervision showed no effect on perceptions of quality of supervision.
   Implications for extending the use of technology-mediated supervision
   to practicing professionals are presented.

TI Modeling Academic Education Processes by Dynamic Storyboarding
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE Process modeling; Learning processes; Storyboarding; Dynamic learning
   need reflection system; Knowledge engineering
AB In high-level education such as university studies, there is a flexible
   but complicated system of subject offerings and registration rules such
   as prerequisite subjects. Those offerings, connected with registration
   rules, should be matched to the students' learning needs and desires,
   which change dynamically. Students need assistance in such a maze of
   dynamically changing opportunities and limitations. To cope with this
   problem, a new storyboard concept for academic education, called
   "dynamic storyboarding" is proposed to assist university students.
   Dynamic storyboarding is based on the idea of semi-formally
   representing, processing, evaluating, and refining didactic knowledge.
   This storyboarding is more appropriate in managing high-level education
   than is general artificial intelligence knowledge representations such
   as frames. This is because the structure of dynamic storyboarding is
   driven by the semi-formal and multilayered nature of didactic knowledge
   in university education. A feasibility study showed that storyboarding
   can be used to supplement an academic educational system, such as the
   dynamic learning need reflection system (DLNRS) of Tokyo Denki
   University (TDU) in Japan. Concretely speaking, didactic knowledge in
   the university curricula was proven to be easily and clearly
   represented by dynamic storyboarding. This contributed to the students'
   dynamic learning activities by supporting features that help students
   review and adapt their own individual curricula.

AB Given the impact of textbooks on learning, this study assesses the five
   most frequently used secondary school biology textbooks in Turkey to
   examine the nature and the quality of treatment given to the nature of
   science. A qualitative oriented approach was employed and ethnographic
   content analysis was used as the methodological framework for this
   particular research. Data were analyzed by means of cognitive maps. The
   investigation revealed a number of serious problems with the way nature
   of science is portrayed in the textbooks. Science was generally
   portrayed as collection of facts, not as a dynamic process of
   generating and testing alternative explanations about nature. The
   authors of the textbooks often appeared not to understand the processes
   well enough to explain them to students and therefore presented various
   misleading and inadequate descriptions regarding scientific enterprise,
   similar to those revealed by research on science teachers' and
   students' understandings of science. Furthermore, some important
   aspects of science were found to be neglected by textbooks. The study
   discusses the future success of scientific literacy movement in Turkey
   and has implications for science education, science curriculum, and
   science teacher education in Turkey and other developing countries. (C)

AB This paper reports on a Study that employed metacognition and social
   cognition theoretical frameworks to explore and interpret students'
   views of their cognitive roles and the nature of the mechanisms that
   they considered influenced and mediated their learning within small
   group contexts. An instrumental interpretive case Study methodology was
   used to capture students' descriptive accounts of their Year II Biology
   learning experiences, as conveyed through their recollections and
   reflections concerning their interactions and roles, perceptions of the
   learning task, and their learning strategies that they considered to be
   manifest during a field trip visit to a nature center. We conclude
   that, even among apparently highly collegial student groups, deemed by
   their teacher to be effective learning groups, and constituted in ways
   consistent with the literature on effective collaborative group work,
   there existed metasocial metacognitive factors that influenced and
   shaped cognition in ways counterproductive to the effective learning of
   science. This study reveals the existence of metacognitive knowledge
   and processes, common among students and related to their views of what
   is appropriate thinking and behavior within small groups, which inform
   collective and individual task actions. We contend that students are
   highly aware of their social status within groups and of their
   individual group's social conditions and that this awareness affects
   cognition and behavior. Moreover, they monitor these conditions and
   employ strategies that simultaneously service both the task and social
   relationships and their learning processes to varying extents depending
   on individual and group factors. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci

TI The Role of Metaphor in Darwin and the Implications for Teaching

LA English
DT Article
ID STUDENTS; SCIENCE
AB This article is about the role of metaphor in scientific knowledge
   formation and reasoning. These issues are studied by means of an
   example of the theory of evolution through natural selection. The
   premise is that the theory of evolution contains a set of problems
   regarding metaphor. A second premise is that these problems have to be
   handled in one way or another when trying to learn, explain, or discuss
   the theory. How metaphor plays a role in Darwin's writings is analyzed
   through examples taken from on the Origin of Species. Which metaphors
   are used by Darwin and which problems do they solve and raise,
   respectively? It is shown how Darwin uses a variety of metaphors, and
   that he grapples with this issue. The findings are discussed in terms
   of the implications for teaching evolutionary theory. Some inherent
   difficulties in learning the theory of evolution, and more generally
   abstract complex scientific knowledge, are discussed. (C) 2009 Wiley

ID KNOWLEDGE; COMMUNITY; REFORM
AB As professional learning communities (PLCs) are proliferating as a form
   of teacher professional development, it is important to understand what
   "PLC work" is and how it impacts teacher learning. This article reports
   on secondary science and mathematics teachers' participation in PLCs
   and engagement in collaborative inquiry. The PLC provided a structure
   for coming together; their inquiry questions focused their attention on
   gaps between a shared vision for student learning and student
   achievement. Qualitative data from three in-depth cases are analyzed in
   three categories: (1) collective activities, (2) questions raised, and
   (3) knowledge generated. The cases show different trajectories of
   teachers' PLC work and reveal the difficulties teachers had in asking
   critical questions about their practices. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals,

ID SCIENTIFIC LITERACY; POPULAR REPORTS; KNOWLEDGE; PAPER
AB In this paper we make the case that the language of school science and
   the language of science are widely divergent. We trace the divergence
   to a simple view of reading that prevails not only in science education
   but in most of schooling. Based upon the importance of language in
   science and the role of language in capturing the essential nature of
   scientific reasoning, we conclude that conceiving of reading as a form
   of inquiry could assist in bringing the two languages more into
   alignment. We recommend the use of adapted primary literature as one
   curriculum and instruction innovation that can be useful in
   illustrating the nature of reading as inquiry.

   cloning'), contrasted with four Journalistic Reported Versions (JRV) of
   it, and with students' summaries of one JRV. As the evaluation of
   evidence is one of the critical features of argumentation
   (Jim,nez-Aleixandre 2008), the analysis focuses on the use of evidence,
   drawing from instruments to analyze written argumentation (Kelly et al.
   2008) and from studies about the structure of empirical research
   reports (Swales 2001). The objectives are: 1) To examine the use of
   evidence and the argumentative structure of Hwang et al.'s Science,
   303: 1669-1674 (2004) original paper in terms of the criteria: a)
   pertinence of the evidence presented to the claims; b) sufficiency of
   the evidence for the purpose of supporting the claims; and c)
   coordination of the evidence across epistemic levels. 2) To explore how
   the structure of Hwang's paper translates into the JRV and into
   university students' perceptions about the evidence supporting the
   claims. The argumentative structure of Hwang's paper is such that its
   apparently ostensible main claim about NT constitutes a justification
   for a second claim about its therapeutic applications, for which no
   evidence is offered. However, this second claim receives prominent
   treatment in the JRV and in the students' summaries. Implications for
   promoting critical reading in the classroom are discussed.

AB Adapted primary literature (APL) is a novel text genre that retains the
   authentic characteristics of primary literature. Learning through APL
   represents an educational intervention with an authentic scientific
   context. In this case study, we analyzed the 80-min discourse developed
   during the enactment of an article from an APL-based curriculum in
   biotechnology in one class, and examined epistemic practices used by
   students during their meaning-making of the Results and Discussion
   sections of the article. Specifically, we examined coordination
   practices, by which students connected elements belonging to different
   epistemic status or context (theory, data, experimental stages,
   biotechnological applications and text). The application of
   coordination practices was identified more than 70 times during the
   lesson. In the context of the Results section, the students displayed
   research-oriented coordination practices, which were frequently
   associated with claims of comprehension difficulty. In the context of
   the Discussion section, students displayed text-oriented coordination
   practices, associated with analysis of the text characteristics. We are
   suggesting that the research-oriented coordination practices and some
   of the text-oriented ones enabled the emergence of authentic scientific
   practices and learning by inquiry. Another type of text-oriented
   coordination practice enabled reflection on scientists' experimental
   processes, enabling learning science as inquiry. The enactment model of
   APL used here allowed for both the emergence of the two dimensions of
   inquiry learning and the promotion of scientific literacy in the
   fundamental and derived senses.

ID ACHIEVEMENT; CLASSROOM; SCHOOL; IDENTITY
AB Many mathematics classrooms use cooperative learning to support
   equitable learning environments for all students. Past research in the
   field has focused primarily on increasing achievement rather than on
   contexts that support equitable interactions. This year-long study in 3
   secondary mathematics classes compares 2 activity structuresa group
   quiz and a presentationby examining group interaction within the 2
   activities. The analysis shows that groups constructed a range of work
   practices, including a practice focused on collaboration, one focused
   on individual work, and one focused on helping. In addition, students
   adopted a variety of positions, including expert, novice, in-between,
   and facilitator. In this data corpus, experts tended to dominate
   interactions during group quizzes, whereas presentation preparations
   were more equitable, particularly when a student was positioned as a
   facilitator. Based on the analysis, suggestions are provided for
   structuring more equitable mathematics group work.

TI Second Life in higher education: Assessing the potential for and the
   barriers to deploying virtual worlds in learning and teaching
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Second Life (SL) is currently the most mature and popular multi-user
   virtual world platform being used in education. Through an in-depth
   examination of SL, this article explores its potential and the barriers
   that multi-user virtual environments present to educators wanting to
   use immersive 3-D spaces in their teaching. The context is set by
   tracing the history of virtual worlds back to early multi-user online
   computer gaming environments and describing the current trends in the
   development of 3-D immersive spaces. A typology for virtual worlds is
   developed and the key features that have made unstructured 3-D spaces
   so attractive to educators are described. The popularity in use of SL
   is examined through three critical components of the virtual
   environment experience: technical, immersive and social. From here, the
   paper discusses the affordances that SL offers for educational
   activities and the types of teaching approaches that are being explored
   by institutions. The work concludes with a critical analysis of the
   barriers to successful implementation of SL as an educational tool and
   maps a number of developments that are underway to address these issues
   across virtual worlds more broadly.

TI Learning in virtual worlds: Using communities of practice to explain
   how people learn from play
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Although there is interest in the educational potential of online
   multiplayer games and virtual worlds, there is still little evidence to
   explain specifically what and how people learn from these environments.
   This paper addresses this issue by exploring the experiences of couples
   that play World of Warcraft together. Learning outcomes were identified
   (involving the management of ludic, social and material resources)
   along with learning processes, which followed Wenger's model of
   participation in Communities of Practice. Comparing this with existing
   literature suggests that productive comparisons can be drawn with the
   experiences of distance education students and the social pressures
   that affect their participation.

TI Socialisation for learning at a distance in a 3-D multi-user virtual
   environment
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID MEDIA RICHNESS; IMMEDIACY
AB This paper reports findings of a pilot study that examined the
   pedagogical potential of Second Life (SL), a popular three-dimensional
   multi-user virtual environment (3-D MUVE) developed by the Linden Lab.
   The study is part of a 1-year research and development project titled
   'Modelling of Secondlife Environments' (http://www.le.ac.uk/moose)
   funded by the UK Joint Information Systems Committee. The research
   question addressed in this paper is: how can learning activities that
   facilitate social presence and foster socialisation among distance
   learners for collaborative learning be developed in SL, a 3-D MUVE? The
   study was carried out at the University of Leicester (UoL) within an
   undergraduate module on Archaeological Theory, where two tutors and
   four students took part in four learning activities designed to take
   place in SL within the UoL Media Zoo island. The learning activities
   and training in SL were based on Salmon's five-stage model of online
   learning. Students' engagement in SL was studied through interviews,
   observations and records of chat logs. The data analysis offers four
   key findings in relation to the nature and pattern of in-world
   'socialisation' and its impact on real-world network building; the
   pattern of in-world 'socialisation' stage in Salmon's 5-stage model;
   perspectives on students' progress in-world through the first stage of
   the model 'access and motivation'-and perspectives on their entry into,
   and progress through, the second stage of the model -'socialisation' -
   and the role of identity presented through avatars in the process of
   socialisation. The paper offers implications for research and practice
   in the light of these findings.

TI Learning in 3-D multiuser virtual environments: Exploring the use of
   unique 3-D attributes for online problem-based learning
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of this article is to present the results of a study
   conducted to investigate how the attributes of 3-D technology such as
   avatars, 3-D space, and comic style bubble dialogue boxes affect
   participants' social, cognitive, and teaching presences in a blended
   problem-based learning environment. The community of inquiry model was
   adopted to analyse and interpret data collected from transcripts and
   group interviews. The results indicated that although the attributes of
   3-D technology promoted participants' social presence, this positive
   online social experience did not completely contribute to participants'
   cognitive presence due to inherent technology attributes. Additionally,
   critical technical and instructional features of the 3-D environment
   were required in order to further enhance teaching presence and overall
   learning experience.

TI Exploring the educational potential of virtual worlds-Some reflections
   from the SPP
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes and reflects on the development of the Schome Park
   Programme (SPP), which was established with the specific aim of
   extending our thinking about schome, which aims to be the optimal
   educational system for the 21st century.
   In an earlier stage of the Schome Initiative, it became clear that
   people find it almost impossible to break free from established
   conceptions of education. Open virtual worlds like Second Life virtual
   world offer opportunities for people to have radically different 'lived
   experiences' of educational systems and thus seemed to be the ideal
   vehicle for exploring alternative models of education. The SPP
   therefore set out in late 2006 to use Teen Second Life virtual world to
   support the development of the vision of schome, informed by current
   understandings about learning, pedagogy and the 'tools' available to us
   today.
   This paper provides an overview of the first three phases of the SPP
   and briefly outlines the research methodologies used within it. This
   leads into a discussion of the potential of virtual worlds to support
   pedagogical exploration, which in turn leads to consideration of three
   dimensions of practice that emerged from the SPP. These three
   dimensions, which correspond closely with a framework developed in
   post-compulsory education, are illustrated by use of descriptions of
   activities and other data from the SPP. The paper concludes by raising
   questions about the extent to which pedagogical practices will change
   in the future as a result of the opportunities offered by virtual
   worlds.

TI Learning from Second Life
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB There is currently widespread interest in exploring the opportunities
   to develop learning that can be delivered in three-dimensional
   multiuser virtual environments (3-D MUVEs). In this paper, I argue for
   the need to conduct research into the emerging cultures of use in 3-D
   MUVEs, focussing on the example of Second Life. Drawing on social and
   cultural studies of 3-D MUVEs, the paper briefly explores four issues
   in Second Life which have profound implications for the transplanting
   of learning: (1) the emerging 'virtual vernacular' of Second Life
   builds, (2) the development of a capitalist economy within and beyond
   Second Life, (3) the phenomenon of 'griefing', and (4) the need to take
   account of the everydayness of Second Life. Only by attending to the
   cultures of use in 3-D MUVEs-learning from Second Life-can we begin to
   contemplate the potential for learning in Second Life.

   environments such as Second Life (SL) from the perspective of future
   developments in the service of learning. It notes trends within the SL
   innovation to date, including the provision of realistic settings, the
   exploitation of pleasant simulated environments for groups and the
   links with other learning technologies. It also considers the
   creativity sparked by SL's potential to offer the illusion of 3-D
   'spaces' and buildings, and points to infinite imaginative educational
   possibilities. It explores aspects of the construction of virtual
   representations of learners and teachers as avatars, and reveals a wide
   range of intriguing issues yet to be researched.

TI Learners' Mental Models of the Particle Nature of Matter: A study of
   16-year-old Swedish science students
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CHEMISTRY; CONCEPTIONS; EDUCATION
AB The results presented here derive from a longitudinal study of Swedish
   upper secondary science students' (16-19 years of age) developing
   understanding of key chemical concepts. The informants were 18 students
   from two different schools. The aim of the present study was to
   investigate the mental models of matter at the particulate level that
   learners develop. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews
   based around the students' own drawings of the atom, and of solids,
   liquids, and gases. The interview transcripts were analysed to identify
   patterns in the data that offer insight into aspects of student
   understanding. The findings are discussed in the specific curriculum
   context in Swedish schools. Results indicate that the teaching model of
   the atom (derived from Bohr's model) commonly presented by teachers and
   textbook authors in Sweden gives the students an image of a
   disproportionately large and immobile nucleus, emphasises a planetary
   model of the atom and gives rise to a chain of logic leading to
   immobility in the solid state and molecular breakdown during phase
   transitions. The findings indicate that changes in teaching approaches
   are required to better support learners in developing mental models
   that reflect the intended target knowledge.

AB There has been extensive research on children's understanding of
   evaporation, but representational issues entailed in this understanding
   have not been investigated in depth. This study explored three
   students' engagement with science concepts relating to evaporation
   through various representational modes, such as diagrams, verbal
   accounts, gestures, and captioned drawings. This engagement entailed
   students (a) clarifying their thinking through exploring
   representational resources; (b) developing understanding of what these
   representations signify; and (c) learning how to construct
   representational aspects of scientific explanation. The study involved
   a sequence of classroom lessons on evaporation and structured
   interviews with nine children, and found that a focus on
   representational challenges provided fresh insights into the conceptual
   task involved in learning science. The findings suggest that
   teacher-mediated negotiation of representational issues as students
   construct different modal accounts can support enriched learning by
   enabling both (a) richer conceptual understanding by students; and (b)
   enhanced teacher insights into students' thinking.

AB This study deals with the development of a graphic representation tool
   as a way to support educational planning in an elementary school in the
   rural area of Brasilia (Brazil's capital), aiming at the implementation
   of an integrated action-research project focusing on hunger and
   nutrition. The graphic tool made it possible to promote
   dialogical-reflexive interactions among school teachers as to the
   identification of competencies and skills in elementary education
   curriculum and generating apprenticeship themes, scientific concepts,
   and educational activities. It also constitutes a useful tool for the
   teaching staff to realize the interdependences among the many school
   subjects, and to understand their practices, thus leading to
   self-evaluation with greater awareness for potential for transformation.

ID SCHOOL SCIENCE; STUDENTS; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; PHYSICS
AB The present study deals with a school-based professional development
   trajectory for secondary science teachers, aiming at scaffolding
   teachers in open-inquiry teaching for the topic of water quality. Its
   design was based on the leading principle of 'guiding by scaffolding'.
   Seven experienced teachers participated in institutional meetings and
   teaching at school. The research focused on designing scaffolding
   tools, addressing these tools in the meetings, and implementing them in
   the classroom. The main research data were obtained from meetings,
   classroom discussions, and observations. The results indicated that the
   professional development trajectory has promoted teachers' learning of
   scaffolding students in open inquiry, especially the ability to know
   when and how to give students a well-balanced combination of
   'structure' for open-inquiry learning and sufficient 'space' for that.
   The implications for science teacher education are discussed.

AB Alternative certification programs (ACPs) have been proposed as a
   viable way to address teacher shortages, yet we know little about how
   teacher knowledge develops within such programs. The purpose of this
   Study was to investigate prior knowledge for teaching among students
   entering an ACP, comparing individuals with teaching experience to
   those lacking teaching experience. Of the four participants seeking
   secondary biology teaching certification, two participants had 2 years
   of prior biology teaching experience. We used the Lesson Preparation
   Method as a data collection tool, asking participants to create lesson
   plans to teach the concept of heritable variation. Primary data sources
   were the lesson plans and follow-up interview transcripts. Prior
   teaching experience made little difference as both groups held didactic
   teaching orientations and wrote similar lesson plans. Both groups drew
   on general pedagogical knowledge (PK), and had little pedagogical
   content knowledge for teaching heritable variation. Teaching experience
   did appear to lead to more integration among PK components. The study
   includes implications for the teacher education, research, and policy.

ID SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY; CONCEPTIONS; STUDENTS; EXPLICIT; BELIEFS; PROGRAM
AB To explore how elementary teachers may differ from secondary teachers
   in their views about NOS, a professional development experience
   involving explicit reflective instruction on NOS, discussions about
   science with scientists, and exposing the teachers to the practices,
   techniques, and collaborations fundamental to scientific research was
   designed. The goal of this professional development project was to
   immerse the teachers in an environment where science was going on all
   around them and where they could hear and discuss ideas about NOS,
   science concepts, and teaching science with scientists and engineers.
   Data on teachers' views were collected through interviews,
   questionnaires, reflective papers, and taped class discussions. The
   findings indicate that secondary teachers with previous experiences in
   research did not change their views of scientists or NOS; all but one
   of the elementary and middle school teachers improved in these areas.
   The factors most influential in affecting teachers' views were the
   one-on-one interviews teachers held with scientists, job shadowing
   experiences, and explicit, reflective instruction presented on the NOS.

ID COMMUNICATION BEHAVIOR; LEVEL ENVIRONMENT; CLIMATE; CLASSROOM;

AB Because the school environment has been shown to play an important role
   in teacher and student performance, we undertook research into the
   assessment of school environment, differences between female and male
   science teachers' perceptions of their school environments, and
   associations between these school environment perceptions and teachers'
   background characteristics. Although gender differences in science
   education have attracted both public concern and academic interest,
   little research has specifically addressed this issue in terms of the
   school environment. Data were collected from a large sample of 300
   female and 518 male science teachers from secondary schools in Taiwan.
   Statistically significant gender differences were found in most aspects
   of the school environment, with female science teachers perceiving
   greater collegiality, among teachers, higher gender equity among
   students, and stronger professional interest, and with male science
   teachers perceiving lower work pressure and better teacher-student
   relations. Gender differences in science teachers' perceptions of
   collegiality, work pressure, and gender equity in the school
   environment persisted even after controlling for teachers' background
   and school characteristics. Among the implications are recommendations
   about administrative policy for improving the school environment for
   both male and female teachers and about future research on factors
   associated with teachers' perceptions. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study uses a new-to-educational-research methodology, based on the
   legal process, to build a case that U.S. students have been largely
   ignored in discussion and planning for their own, presumed futures. A
   variety of evidence, from two large and distinct data bases, is drawn
   together to show: (1) students perceive their classrooms in ways
   distinctly different from the ways in which teachers perceive the same
   classrooms, (2) students' values are fundamentally different front
   teachers', (3) student and teacher cultures work together to perpetuate
   the status quo, and (4) existing educational policy, and the research
   on which it is based, does not adequately consider student culture. A
   global student culture of "dealing" is described and it is argued that
   this culture is an underlying cause of the deterioration in the
   achievement of U.S. students and the failures of so many reform efforts
   to bring about substantial and lasting change. (C) 2009 Wiley

AB This study examined an interdisciplinary scientific research project to
   understand how graduate and undergraduate honors students team to do
   science. It was found that the education of the students occurs as part
   of an apprenticeship. The apprenticeship takes place in research
   groups. In general, research groups are structured in two ways: loosely
   organized and tightly organized, and have characteristics of both
   communities of practice and epistemic communities. Students have
   different roles in the research groups: novice researcher, proficient
   technician, or knowledge producer. Their role depends on their
   knowledge and skills, and their degree programs. It is possible for
   students to develop expertise along a continuum from novice researcher
   to knowledge producer. The members of the research group, including the
   professor and other students. facilitate the development of the
   students along the continuum of roles. Implications for the education
   of science teachers are discussed. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals. Inc. J

AB Although scale has been identified as one of four major
   interdisciplinary themes that cut across the science domains by the
   American Association for the Advancement of Science (1989), we are only
   beginning to understand how students learn and apply scale concepts.
   Early research on learning scale tended to focus on perceptions of
   linear distances, navigation and way finding, whereas more recent work
   has examined how students conceptualize scale in science contexts. This
   study sought to understand how understandings of scale develop from
   childhood to adulthood by asking 50 professionals to reflect on their
   experiences (in and out-of-school) learning about scale.
   Semi-structured interviews were utilized to obtain information about
   educational experiences. informal experiences, and applications of
   scale in different professions. Results showed that most of the
   participants used anchor points as conceptual benchmarks when applying
   scale in their job. Seventy-six percent of the participants attributed
   physical experiences such as moving through the environment by car,
   walking, bicycling, or flying in an airplane as contributing to the
   development of a sense of scale. Results of this study were used to
   develop a possible model of the trajectory of scale concepts that
   develop as individuals move from novice through increasing degrees of
   expertise. Across professions, participants emphasized the critical
   role that scale play, in their work. For many, scale was viewed as
   central to accomplishing the work-related tasks. (C) 2009 Wiley

AB PictoPal is the name of a technology-supported intervention designed to
   foster the development of emergent reading and writing skills in four
   and five year old children. Following the theoretical underpinnings and
   a brief description of PictoPal, this article describes how children
   worked with the technology; how the intervention elicited their
   engagement with literacy concepts both on the computer and off; and
   effects on early literacy learning. Observation results indicate that
   children are able to work independently with the program after a few
   instruction sessions. Observation data yield insight in the nature of
   adult guidance and the way the results of computer activities were
   implemented in off-computer classroom activities, as well as areas
   where this could be improved. Comparison of the four pre-post test
   experiments used to assess learning effects, suggest that the
   on-computer activities in PictoPal can yield a statistically
   significant learning effect, but only when integration with
   off-computer activities is present. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB An interactive classroom communication system (ICCS) involves the use
   of remote devices that permit all students in a class to respond to
   multiple choice questions displayed on a LCD projector. After responses
   are clicked in, the results are instantly aggregated and displayed in
   chart form. The purpose of this study was to examine gender differences
   in attitudes toward ICCSs for 659 secondary school students. The
   initial results suggested that male students had significantly more
   positive attitudes than female students with respect to student
   involvement, assessment, and perceived learning. However, a number of
   these differences disappeared when computer comfort level and type of
   use were added as covariates. Male students still perceived that ICCSs
   improved the overall learning process more than female students
   regardless of computer comfort level or type of use. (C) 2008 Elsevier

AB This study reports research findings on the use of animated cartoons in
   a multimedia application meant to evaluate their effectiveness in
   supporting teaching and learning in science. The researchers have
   developed a cartoon-style multimedia application whereas animated
   cartoons where designed from scratch using appropriate programs. The
   study was carried out in various elementary schools of Athens, Greece,
   and 179 pupils aged 10-11 years participated in it. The research
   results provide evidence that the use of animated cartoons
   significantly increases the young students' knowledge and understanding
   of specific science concepts, which are normally difficult to
   comprehend and often cause misconceptions to them. (C) 2008 Elsevier

ID FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT
AB The CourseMarker system has been used to assess free-response computer
   based assessment (CBA) exercises since 1998. The aim of the studies
   reported here was to evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of
   developing and deploying diagram-based exercises using DATsys, an
   authoring environment for diagram-based CBA, together with
   CourseMarker. Postgraduate students constructed diagram-based exercises
   in four domains. The process of constructing the exercises was captured
   as an indicator of feasibility. The exercises were then used to assess
   two cohorts of undergraduate students. Instruments including system
   submission logs and student questionnaires were used to assess
   usefulness.
   Findings indicate that there is considerable potential for the
   assessment of free-response domains such as diagrams. Such an approach
   can help students as part of an iterative process of learning by
   allowing repeated submission of coursework, which may be most
   appropriate within a formative assessment context. The exercises are
   popular with Students and demonstrate a gradual, though decelerating,
   increase in marks over subsequent submissions. The techniques are
   reliable, but further development allowing for alternative model
   solutions and assessment of the aesthetic appearance of diagrams would
   increase validity. Our techniques and findings are novel for CBA, and
   have implications for the increasingly important research area of
   formative assessment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID COMPUTER-SIMULATION; ENVIRONMENT; SUPPORT
AB There has been an increasing interest in employing decision-theoretic
   framework for learner modeling and provision of pedagogical support in
   Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). Much of the existing learner
   modeling research work focuses on identifying appropriate learner
   properties. Little attention, however, has been given to leverage
   Dynamic Decision Network (DDN) as a dynamic learner model to reason and
   intervene across time. Employing a DDN-based learner model in a
   scientific inquiry learning environment, however, remains at infant
   stage because there are factors contributed to the performance the
   learner model. Three factors have been identified to influence the
   matching accuracy of INQPRO's learner model. These factors are the
   structure of DDN model, the variable instantiation approach, and the
   weights assignment method for two consecutive Decision Networks (DNs).
   In this research work, a two-phase empirical study involving 107
   learners and six domain experts was conducted to determine the optimal
   conditions for the INQPRO's dynamic learner model. The empirical
   results suggested each time-slice of the INQPRO's DDN should consist of
   a DN, and that DN should correspond to the Graphical User Interface
   (GUI) accessed. In light of evidence, observable variables should be
   instantiated to their observed states; leaving the remaining observable
   nodes uninstantiated. The empirical results also indicated that varying
   weights between two consecutive DNs could optimize the matching
   accuracy of INQPRO's dynamic learner model. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All
