TI Effectiveness of a constructivist approach to science instruction for
   prospective elementary teachers
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CONCEPTUAL CHANGE STRATEGIES; COGNITIVE CONFLICT; KNOWLEDGE; CHEMISTRY
AB This study examines the effectiveness of a new constructivist
   curriculum model (Powerful Ideas in Physical Science) in improving
   prospective teachers' understanding of science concepts, in fostering a
   learning environment supporting conceptual understanding, and in
   promoting positive attitudes toward learning and teaching science and
   chemistry in particular. A non-equivalent pretest-post-test
   control-group design was employed. Analysis of covariance and
   repeated-measures analyses of variance were performed to analyze the
   scores on concept tests and attitude surveys. Data from videotaped
   observations of laboratory sessions and interviews of prospective
   teachers were analyzed by employing a naturalistic inquiry method to
   provide insights into the process of science learning and teaching for
   the teacher trainees. The interpretations were made based on the
   findings that could be corroborated by both methodologies. Conclusions
   and limitations of the present study as well as recommendations for
   future implementation of constructivist science curriculum in general
   are also included.

AB The purpose of this paper is to report our findings from a qualitative
   study intended to develop our understandings of: what high-poverty
   urban children understand and believe about food and food systems; and
   how such children transform and use that knowledge in their everyday
   lives (i.e. how do they express their scientific literacies including
   content understandings, process understandings, habits of mind in these
   content areas). This qualitative study is part of a larger study
   focused on understanding and developing science and nutritional
   literacies among high-poverty urban fourth-grade through sixth-grade

ID TEACHING PHYSICS; EDUCATION; SCIENCE
AB This paper re-centres the discussion of student learning in physics to
   focus on context. In order to do so, a theoretically motivated
   understanding of context is developed. Given a well-defined notion of
   context, data from a novel university class in electricity and
   magnetism are analysed to demonstrate the central and inextricable role
   of context in student learning. This work sits within a broader effort
   to create and analyse environments that support student learning in the

TI Student-teachers' ability to read nature: Reflections on their own
   learning in ecology
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CHILDRENS IDEAS; ECOSYSTEMS; BIOLOGY; MATTER
AB This paper addresses student-teachers' ability to read nature in a
   woodland habitat before and after a 10-week ecology course. Reading
   nature is our definition of the ability to observe, describe and
   explain basic ecology in the field. Data consists of field-based
   pre-course and post-course interviews followed up by metacognitive
   interviews where students analyse their own learning. A bi-dimensional
   coding scheme is adopted to examine the range and development of
   students' ability to read nature. Students find it important to know
   the ecology of a few key species and they recognize the importance of
   having learned the language of ecology - ecologish - helping them to
   describe and discuss ecology. Students generally recognize the
   excursions as key learning situations in ecology education but they
   give different reasons for finding excursions so important. This
   variation will be elaborated in the paper together with the
   implications for teaching ecology.

AB How can we accelerate innovation and ensure effective dissemination of
   knowledge about online learning resources? This paper advocates
   strategies that systematically link online professional development
   with the research, development and diffusion cycle. The systemic
   approach we describe can accelerate knowledge advancement and help
   manage change by improving communication among teachers, trainers,
   developers and researchers. The examples that are provided are set
   within two funded projects in the United States that led to the
   development of two distinct but related strategies-the Online Site
   Evaluation Form for educators (a web-based review form used in
   workshops) and a six-week online course on technology-supported
   assessments. Both strategies make it easier to give feedback to
   developers and offer incentives to do so in ways that help teachers to
   learn about online resources individually and with colleagues. The
   examples are discussed with analysis of their strengths and weaknesses
   in supporting different modes of interaction. We highlight implications
   for instructional development, professional development, research and
   knowledge management in online communities.

   sustainability, describing the proven qualities of a project and the
   innovations that support its sustained existence over time. We then
   describe how a US Department of Education Technology Innovation
   Challenge grantee, working to promote technology integration in a
   socio-economically disadvantaged region of the state of Texas,
   succeeded in creating a sustainable set of activities around its work
   to support educators' uses of technology. We examine the factors that
   served to nurture and facilitate sustainability of the practices
   associated with technology integration to promote student achievement.
   We take the fact that it is not the project but rather the change in
   practice that is important.

AB Four fifth-grade classrooms embarked on a modified ubiquitous computing
   initiative in the fall of 2003. Two 15-computer wireless laptop carts
   were shared among the four classrooms in an effort to integrate
   technology across the curriculum and affect change in student learning
   and teacher pedagogy. This initiative-in contrast to other one-to-one
   programmemess and stationary labs-offers public schools alternatives to
   budget constraints and instructional-space overhead. Results indicate
   positive teacher technology competence and confidence, as well as
   instructional strategies that were student-centred made meaningful uses
   of technology. Teacher technological knowledge and efficacy,
   pedagogical knowledge, and a supportive school community seem to be
   strong indicators for impacting technology integration in this context.

TI How can academics stay in control?
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB As universities transform into enterprises, academics are facing new
   challenges, especially in their teaching. This is because of the
   demands for student-centred programmes that offer more flexibility, the
   use of Course Management Systems such as Blackboard, and the
   expectation that instructors will perform (more) efficiently and
   effectively. In this research, the focus is on teaching-related
   activities to support instructors to stay in control, given these
   increasing pressures. A Personal Performance Model that shows key
   aspects of academics' performance relating to teaching tasks was
   developed. A series of studies relating to gaps between expected and
   actual performance was carried out using the Human Performance
   Technology methodology. As an intervention based on these gaps, a
   Personal Performance Support Tool was developed to support instructors
   with their time and task management in relation to teaching, as well as
   to develop an elaborated insight on how to support instructors as they
   respond to changing expectations for their teaching performance. Key
   steps to guide universities in implementing such a support tool have
   been identified as a result of the research.

TI The game, the pieces, and the players: Generative resources from two
   instructional portrayals of experimentation
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID SCHOOL
AB Descriptions of disciplinary practices can suggest visions of authentic
   classroom activities. Designing activities that are effective, however,
   requires an additional framework for identifying a discipline's
   generative resources-that is, those teaming targets that enable
   students to make disciplinary sense and progress in subsequent
   situations. This study represents an empirical exploration of the
   generative resources supported by alternative descriptions of
   experimentation, 1 focusing on its logical aspects and another on its
   measurement aspects. Each description of experimentation was portrayed
   in 1 of 2 concurrent 6th-grade units. In a broad capture of teaming
   outcomes, assessment data suggest particular dimensions of
   learning-characterized here as game, pieces, and players-account for
   students' subsequent generative behavior. Striking differences in
   disciplinary facility were apparent from what students learned from
   these contrasting units, highlighting the instructional importance of
   supporting generative resources for valued disciplinary activity. This
   exploration of generative resources draws on recent efforts to
   reconceptualize transfer and adds to accumulating examples of
   design-based research as an effective methodology for supporting sound
   instruction and innovation.

TI A collective case study of the use of ICT in economics courses: A
   sociocultural approach
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID CLASSROOM; PACKAGE
AB Based on a collective case study of the use of an economics Information
   and Communication Technologies (ICT) tutorial-based package, WinEcon,
   in 3 British schools, this article examines the activity structures
   that exist in ICT-mediated lessons situated within their broader
   sociocultural contexts. Activity theory and its highly developed ideas
   of the sociocultural conceptions of human nature and cognition are
   adopted to frame the study. By drawing together Gifford's (1997)
   mediated learning model and Cole's (1995) culture as garden metaphor,
   the former captures the activities mediated by students, teachers, ICT,
   and non-ICT tools in the course, and these are situated in the latter's
   broader sociocultural settings of the school, education system, and
   society at large.
   Although the article provides an account of the use of WinEcon in
   economics courses, its emphases are on the issues and problems of ICT
   integration: course objectives, teaching and learning tools,
   participants, sociocultural constraints, activities, and design of the
   learning environment. Consistent with other studies of ICT integration,
   there are 2 interrelated points for consideration regarding the use of
   ICT in enculturating students to think "in an economics way": (a)
   pivotal role of the teacher in the design of the learning environment
   and (b) object of activities, sociocultural constraints, and the
   enculturation process.

TI Technology-mediation and tutoring: How do they shape progressive
   inquiry discourse?
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS; STUDENTS; SCHOOL; CURRICULUM; PARADIGM
AB In higher education, there is a challenge to gain the full benefit of
   the potentials of teaming technology for collaborative knowledge
   advancement and for scaffolding practices of academic literacy and
   scientific argumentation. The technology, ideally, would be used to
   provide support that enables students to deal with more demanding tasks
   than they could otherwise handle.
   We investigated the benefits of teaming technology by examining the
   role of technology-mediation and tutoring in directing students'
   knowledge production in inquiry-based teaming. A comparative analysis
   of inquiry discourse was conducted for 3 conditions between nonmediated
   and technology-mediated inquiry processes, the latter both tutored and
   nontutored. Qualitative content analysis was employed to examine how
   the scale of scaffolding related to the nature of knowledge produced.
   Furthermore, a descriptive analysis of the progression of discourse was
   conducted to examine evidence for deepening the question-explanation
   process, development of ideas in dialogue, and self-reflection.
   The scaffolding provided by the teaming technology (The Future Learning
   Environment), together with the possibility for dialogue, appear to
   have supported practices of problem-setting, self-reflection, and
   collaborative development of ideas. Students in the 2
   technology-mediated conditions were developing their ideas in dialogue,
   building on each other's knowledge and questions. Tutoring was found to
   be valuable for providing additional models and tools for advancing
   inquiry. Specific to the students of the nontechnology condition (who
   wrote learning-logs) was that they put more effort into understanding
   the theoretical content, evaluating and arguing it, but they did not
   engage in shared development of ideas.
   Through a combination of the practices, the authors foresee a
   potential, in higher education, for development of in-depth inquiry and
   practices of knowledge advancement including the nurturance of
   epistemic agency.

   conferences
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMUNICATION
AB Previous computer conferencing research has been concerned with the
   organizational, technical, social, and motivational factors that
   support and sustain online interaction. This article studies online
   interaction from a different perspective. Rather than analyze the
   processes that sustain discourse, the following research examines how
   and why discussions shut down. A computer simulation of asynchronous
   threaded interaction suggests that certain common online habits, when
   practiced by many people, can adversely affect the lifespan of some
   threads. Specifically, the widespread practice of focusing attention on
   unread notes during computer conferencing sessions can produce a
   starvation condition that hastens the death of some threads and reduces
   the likelihood that inactive threads will become active again. The
   longevity of a thread, therefore, is partially affected by the kinds of
   routines that online participants follow when they use a computer
   conferencing interface. The educational implications of this finding
   are discussed, and strategies are presented for limiting adverse
   educational effects.

AB This research examined the impact of the first-year implementation of
   an instructional intervention to promote achievement and equity in
   science and literacy for culturally and linguistically diverse
   elementary students. The research addressed three areas: (a) overall
   science and literacy achievement, (b) achievement gaps among
   demographic subgroups, and (c) comparison with national (NAEP) and
   international (TIMSS) samples of students. The research involved 1,523
   third- and fourth-grade students at six elementary schools in a large
   urban school district. Significance tests of mean scores between pre-
   and posttests indicate statistically significant increases on all
   measures of science and literacy at both grade levels. While
   achievement gaps widened with third graders on some of the measures,
   the gaps tended to narrow with fourth graders. The results based on
   item-by-item comparisons with NAEP TIMSS samples of students indicated
   overall positive performance of the students in the research at the end
   of the school year. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID SCHOOL STUDENTS; ACHIEVEMENT
AB The purpose of this research effort was to examine Black male students'
   self-perceptions of academic ability and gifted potential in science.
   The purposeful sample consisted of nine Black males between the ages of
   14 and 18 years. Four categories of self-perceptions of academic
   ability and gifted potential emerged from the data. These included: (a)
   gifted high achievers; (b) gifted "could do better" high achievers; (c)
   gifted "could do better" situational nonachievers; and (d) gifted
   "could do better" underachievers. Science teachers' influences that
   referenced participants' academic achievement pointed to validation.
   Participants' perceptions regarding how science teachers' influenced
   their academic performance focused on science teachers' content
   knowledge. Power dynamics germane to Black male participants' value or
   worth that directed their efforts in science learning environments are
   discussed. Implications are posited for science teaching, science
   education programs, and future research. This research endeavor was
   based on two premises. The first premise is that Black males'
   self-perceptions of academic ability affect their science academic
   achievement. The second premise is that, given parental, peer, and
   community influences, science teachers have considerable influence on
   students' self-perceptions of academic ability. However, the focus of
   this research was not on parental influences, peer influences, or any
   potential influences that participants' communities may have on their
   academic achievement. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This article reports on the results of a planning grant studying the
   effects of a highly rated curriculum unit on a diverse student
   population. The treatment was introduced to 1500 eighth grade students
   in five middle schools selected for their ethnic, linguistic, and
   socioeconomic diversity. Students were given pre-, post-, and delayed
   posttests on a Conservation of Matter Assessment and measures of
   motivation and engagement. This quasi-experiment found statistically
   significant posttest results for achievement, basic learning
   engagement, and goal orientation. Analyses of disaggregated data showed
   that subgroups of students in the treatment condition outscored their
   comparison group peers (n = 1500) in achievement in all cases, except
   for students currently enrolled in ESOL. Analysis of video data of a
   diverse group of four students as the unit was enacted suggests that
   students entered a learning environment that permitted them to function
   in different, but consistent ways over time; that is, the frequency of
   students' manipulation of objects showed a different pattern of
   engagement for each of the four students compared with patterns of
   verbal responses such as the use of scientific terms. The results of
   this planning grant paved the way for a large study of the scale-up of
   highly rated curriculum units. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID SUBJECT-MATTER; SCIENCE; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; MOLECULES
AB In this article, we describe the results of a study of the pedagogical
   content knowledge (PCK) of preservice chemistry teachers in the context
   of a postgraduate teacher education program. A group of preservice
   teachers (n = 12) took part in an experimental introductory course
   module about the use of particle models to help secondary school
   students understand the relationship between phenomena (e.g.,
   properties of substances, physical and chemical processes) and
   corpuscular entities (e.g., atoms, molecules, ions). The module
   emphasized learning from teaching by connecting authentic teaching
   experiences with institutional workshops. Research data were obtained
   from answers to written assignments, transcripts of workshop
   discussions, and reflective lesson reports, written by the
   participants. The outcomes of the study revealed that, initially, all
   participants were able to describe specific learning difficulties, such
   as problems secondary school students have in relating the properties
   of substances to characteristics of the constituent particles. Also, at
   this stage, all preservice teachers acknowledged the potential
   importance of using models of molecules and atoms to promote secondary
   school students' understanding of the relationship between phenomena
   and corpuscular entities. After teaching, all preservice teachers
   demonstrated a deeper understanding of their students' problems with
   the use of particle models. In addition, about half of the participants
   had become more aware of the possibilities and limitations of using
   particle models in specific teaching situations. Through learning from

AB In this study, an instructional design model was employed for
   restructuring a teacher education course with technology. The model was
   applied in a science education method course, which was offered in two
   different but consecutive semesters with a total enrollment of 111
   students in the fall semester and 116 students in the spring semester.
   Using tools, such as multimedia authoring tools in the fall semester
   and modeling software in the spring semester, teacher educators
   designed high quality technology-infused lessons for science and,
   thereafter, modeled them in classroom for preservice teachers. An
   assessment instrument was constructed to assess preservice teachers'
   technology competency, which was measured in terms of four aspects,
   namely, (a) selection of appropriate science topics to be taught with
   technology, (b) use of appropriate technology-supported representations
   and transformations for science content, (c) use of technology to
   support teaching strategies, and (d) integration of computer activities
   with appropriate inquiry-based pedagogy in the science classroom. The
   results of a MANOVA showed that preservice teachers in the Modeling
   group outperformed preservice teachers' overall performance in the
   Multimedia group, F = 21.534, p = 0.000. More specifically, the
   Modeling group outperformed the Multimedia group on only two of the
   four aspects of technology competency, namely, use of technology to
   support teaching strategies and integration of computer activities with
   appropriate pedagogy in the classroom, F = 59.893, p = 0.000, and F =
   10.943, p = 0.001 respectively. The results indicate that the task of
   preparing preservice teachers to become technology competent is
   difficult and requires many efforts for providing them with ample of
   opportunities during their education to develop the competencies needed
   to be able to teach with technology. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Previous research suggests that an eventual information technology (IT)
   success depend on both its initial adoption (acceptance) and subsequent
   continued usage (continuance). Expectancy disconfirmation theory (EDT)
   has been successfully used to predict users' intention to continue
   using information technologies. This study proposed a decomposed EDT
   model to examine cognitive beliefs and affect that influence users'
   continuance decision in the context of e-learning service. The proposed
   model extended EDT by decomposing the perceived performance component
   into usability, quality, and value. Research hypotheses derived from
   this model are empirically validated using the responses to a survey on
   c-learning usage among 183 users. The results suggest that users'
   continuance intention is determined by satisfaction, which in turn is
   jointly determined by perceived usability, perceived quality, perceived
   value, and usability disconfirmation. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB In the last few years, schools and universities have incorporated
   personal digital assistants (PDAs) into their teaching curricula in an
   attempt to enhance students' learning experience and reduce
   instructors' workload. One of the most common uses of PDAs in the
   classroom is as a test administrator. This study compared the usability
   effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of a PDA-based quiz
   application to that of standard paper-and-pencil quizzes in a
   university course. Effectiveness was measured as students' quiz scores
   and through a mental workload questionnaire; efficiency was the time it
   took students to complete each quiz; and satisfaction was evaluated
   using a subjective user satisfaction questionnaire. The study showed
   the PDA-based quiz to be more efficient, that is, students completed it
   in less time than they needed to complete the paper-and-pencil quiz. No
   differences in effectiveness and satisfaction were found between the
   two quiz types. Computer anxiety was not affected by the quiz type. For
   these reasons, as well as other advantages to both students (e.g.,
   real-time scoring) and teachers (e.g., less time spent on grading),
   PDAs are an attractive test administration option for schools and
   universities. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Conferences as learning communities: some early lessons in using
   'back-channel' technologies at an academic conference - distributed

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING
LA English
DT Article

   technology; order; sequence
AB Most, if not all, researchers attend conferences as a part of their
   practice, and yet it is an under-researched activity. Little attention
   has been paid either to developing a theoretically informed
   understanding of conference practice as knowledge building, or to
   assessing the extent to which conferences are successful. This paper
   addresses these issues in the context of a small empirical study of the
   introduction of mobile, interactive ('back-channel') technologies into
   a conference setting. Science studies and learning theories literatures
   are used to develop an eight-point statement describing the aims of an
   idealised conference. This is then used as a framework through which to
   make sense of what happened when 'back-channel' technologies such as
   internet relay chat (IRC) and blogging were introduced into the 2004
   Colston Symposium 'The Evolution of Learning and Web Technologies:
   Survival of the Fittest?'. Focusing on sequential issues and the
   conference as a forum for knowledge building, the analysis shows that
   conference order is disrupted by the introduction of the back-channel
   technologies. Nevertheless, other pressures on academic and
   professional practice (the governance agenda, calls for greater
   collaboration and a more consensual approach, and so on) suggest that
   the potential of the new technologies to help open up the black box of
   scientific and professional practice will be seen as increasingly
   important. If these tools are to be used effectively in the future,
   conferences will need to be supported by new skills and practices.

   that use computers extensively and develop unique relations with them.
   This study presents the development and validation of a CAS especially
   designed for computer science freshmen (CASF). The scale consists of
   five factors, namely, self-confidence in previous knowledge, hardware
   usage anxiety, computer engagement, fears of long-lasting negative
   consequences of computer use and evaluation of positive consequences of
   computers in personal and social life. Using an analytic computer
   experience construct, the scale's components were related to multiple
   aspects of students' computer experience. CASF responses can inform a
   variety of instructional decisions and classroom management strategies
   for the first phase of the students' studies.

AB Collaboration across boundaries in work and learning is increasingly a
   feature of networked organisation. We present a framework for analysing
   learning events as encounters across multiple boundaries of differing
   types, significance, role and severity. These boundaries may provide
   either/both obstacles to, and opportunities for, learning. Tutors and
   learners may negotiate these various boundaries with a variety of
   digital practices and artefacts. We apply this provisional framework of
   boundaries, artefacts and practices to the case of transnational trade
   union education, in which tutors and course participants negotiate a
   complex mix of boundaries. We identify ways in which practices and
   tools can have consequences for multiple boundaries and conclude that
   this approach provides a way to unpack some of the complexity of
   interactions in transnational learning situations and offers a
   framework to identify effective tools and practices.

AB We investigate incentive mechanisms to increase active participation in
   Learning Networks (LNs). The LN under study is LN4LD, an LN for the
   exchange of information about the IMS Learning Design specification. We
   examine how to encourage learners in LN4LD to contribute their
   knowledge, and whether incentive mechanisms can increase the level of
   active participation. We describe an incentive mechanism based on
   constructivist principles and Social Exchange Theory, and
   experimentation using the mechanism designed to increase the level of
   active participation. The incentive mechanism allows individual
   learners to gain personal access to additional information through the
   accumulation of points earned by making contributions. Repeated
   measurements according to a simple interrupted time series with removal
   design show that the level of participation was indeed increased by the
   introduction of the reward system. It can therefore be considered
   worthwhile to use incentive mechanisms in LNs.

   the concept of learning objects as the predominant model for digital
   learning materials, examining the problems that they address. It
   suggests that while there do appear to be real benefits, for a learning
   object model to be successful there needs to be a thriving learning
   object economy. In turn, this demands a wide group of authors, drawn
   from the teaching community, and for these to participate there is an
   urgent requirement for tools that permit the easy creation and
   description of learning materials in learning objects format; but more
   importantly, support for sustainable communities of authors of digital
   learning materials.

AB 'Information commitments' include both a set of evaluative standards
   that Web users utilize to assess the accuracy and usefulness of
   information in Web-based learning environments (implicit component),
   and the information searching strategies that Web users use on the
   Internet (explicit component). An 'Information Commitment Survey'
   (ICS), consisting of aforementioned components, was developed. The
   participants of this study were 610 university students, coming from
   four universities in Taiwan, and their information commitments were
   surveyed. Through a series of structural equation modelling (SEM)
   analyses with Linear Structure RELationships (LISREL), this study
   confirmed the reliability and validity of ICS. More importantly, the
   causal relationships between the two components of ICS were also
   examined. The findings showed that learners' evaluative standards on
   Web materials (implicit component) had significant effects on their
   information searching strategies in Web-based learning environments
   (explicit component). For example, learners who utilized an advanced
   evaluative standard, such as using multiple sources to judge the
   accuracy of Web materials, were significantly more oriented toward
   using a sophisticated information searching strategy, such as carefully
   exploring and elaborating information in Web-based learning
   environments. In other words, learners' evaluative standards for Web
   materials should be viewed as important predictors for their searching
   strategies in Web-based learning environments.

AB This article examines concepts and propositions from a theoretical
   perspective, and establishes the need for and develops an extension to
   Concept Maps (CMaps), called Cyclic Concept Maps (Cyclic CMaps). Cyclic
   CMaps are considered to be an appropriate tool for representing
   knowledge of functional or dynamical relationships between concepts.
   CMaps, on the other hand, are viewed as an appropriate tool for
   representing hierarchic or static knowledge. The two maps complement
   each other and collectively capture a larger domain of knowledge, thus
   forming a more effective knowledge representation tool. (c) 2005 Wiley

ID PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE; PRESERVICE; SERVICE; REFORM
AB Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) is a much debated and studied
   construct. In this article, we adopt an all-embracing view of PCK to
   examine the development of one elementary science teacher's knowledge
   over a 10-year period. We portray this teacher's knowledge at three
   critical points in her career-as a student teacher, beginning teacher,
   and established teacher-and represent and analyze the growth of her
   science PCK using the metaphor of a knowledge tree. The tree metaphor
   shows that while science knowledge begins as the major branch of
   science PCK, it is soon overshadowed by the general teaching and
   interactive knowledge branches of science PCK; however, taken together,
   all three branches contribute over time to the formation of a healthy,
   established tree of science PCK. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID CURRICULUM; CAPABILITY; BIOLOGY
AB This study focuses on the ability of high-school chemistry students,
   who learn chemistry through the inquiry approach, to ask meaningful and
   scientifically sound questions. We investigated (a) the ability of
   students to ask questions related to their observations and findings in
   an inquiry-type experiment (a practical test) and (b) the ability of
   students to ask questions after critically reading a scientific
   article. The student population consisted of two groups: an
   inquiry-laboratory group (experimental group) and a traditional
   laboratory-type group (control group). The three common features
   investigated were (a) the number of questions that were asked by each
   of the students, (b) the cognitive level of the questions, and (c) the
   nature of the questions that were chosen by the students, for the
   purpose of further investigation. Importantly, it was found that
   students in the inquiry group who had experience in asking questions in
   the chemistry laboratory outperformed the control grouping in their
   ability to ask more and better questions. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals,

ID PEDAGOGY; PRAXIS
AB In this article, we explore the roles of student researchers as they
   have emerged over 5 years of studies on the teaching and learning of
   science in urban high schools. These studies incorporate sociocultural
   theory in an approach to research that explores the capital that urban
   students bring to school and situates student researchers as active
   participants who exercise agency by accessing and appropriating a
   variety of resources. We provide examples of students engaged as
   productive, central members of a research team and describe the roles
   in which they have participated, from teacher educators and science
   learners to curriculum developers and ethnographers. We show how the
   involvement of students as researchers, within these roles, allows them
   to produce and select artifacts and data resources for interpretation
   that offer unique insider perspectives on how to improve the teaching
   and learning of science for urban high school students. (c) 2005 Wiley

ID LOW-ACHIEVING STUDENTS; HIGHER-ORDER THINKING; CONCEPTUAL CHANGE;
   ANOMALOUS DATA; STRATEGY; KNOWLEDGE; BELIEFS; SCIENCE; INSTRUCTION;
   VARIABLES
AB Despite inconclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of cognitive
   conflict, educators still consider it a significant instructional
   strategy. One of the challenges of current research is to study the
   conditions under which cognitive conflict is effective. This research
   examines the notion that cognitive conflict may have dissimilar effects
   for students of different academic levels. The study compares the
   effectiveness of teaching the control of variables thinking strategy to
   students of two academic levels (low vs. high) by two different
   teaching methods [inducing a cognitive conflict (ICC) vs. direct
   teaching (DT)]. One hundred twenty-one students who learned in a
   heterogeneous school were divided into four experimental groups in a 2
   x 2 design. Results show no main effect of teaching method but do show
   a significant interaction effect between level of students and teaching
   method. The findings show that students with high academic achievements
   benefited from the ICC teaching method while the DT method hindered
   their progress. In contrast, students with low academic achievements
   benefited from the DT method while the ICC teaching method hindered
   their progress. The interaction effect was preserved in a retention
   test that took place 6 months after instruction. The findings show that
   previous inconclusive findings regarding the effectiveness of the ICC
   method can be explained by its contradictory effects on students of
   different academic levels. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID INTERVENTION
AB Since the early 1980s we have been engaged in the design,
   implementation, and evaluation of "cognitive acceleration" programs,
   which claim to enhance students' general intellectual processing
   skills. We have published extensive data showing long-term effects of
   these programs on students' cognitive development and academic
   achievement. In this paper the theory base of cognitive acceleration
   will be briefly outlined and some typical results re-presented. The
   main body of the paper will be devoted to a discussion of a number of
   issues which arise from the analysis of long-term effects. Although the
   examples will be drawn from the cognitive acceleration programs, the
   issues are general ones which might apply to any long-term study.

ID KNOWLEDGE; STUDENTS; MAPS
AB This paper describes the methods and outcomes of a 12-year longitudinal
   study into the effects of an early intervention program, while
   reflecting back on changes that have occurred in approaches to
   research, learning and instruction since the preliminary inception
   stages of the study in the mid 1960s. We began the study to challenge
   the prevailing consensus at the time that primary school children were
   either preoperational or concrete operational in their cognitive
   development and they could not learn abstract concepts. Our early
   research, based on Ausubelian theory, suggested otherwise. The paper
   describes the development and implementation of a Grade 1-2 audio
   tutorial science instructional sequence, and the subsequent tracing
   over 12 years, of the children's conceptual understandings in science
   compared to a matched control group. During the study the concept map
   was developed as a new tool to trace children's conceptual development.
   We found that students in the instruction group far outperformed their
   non-instructed counterparts, and this difference increased as they
   progressed through middle and high school. The data clearly support the
   earlier introduction of science instruction on basic science concepts,
   such as the particulate nature of matter, energy and energy
   transformations. The data suggest that national curriculum standards
   for science grossly underestimate the learning capabilities of
   primary-grade children. The study has helped to lay a foundation for
   guided instruction using computers and concept mapping that may help
   both teachers and students become more proficient in understanding
   science.

AB This paper is a reflection on a three-year longitudinal study that
   explored the development of children's concept of a substance, for
   which detailed results concerning children's understandings have been
   reported elsewhere. The attention in this paper is on the
   methodological features related to the longitudinal nature of the study
   and the insights into pupils' learning that were afforded by its
   design. There is, of course, an extensive literature on children's
   understandings of scientific ideas, and the nature of conceptual change
   involved in learning is a contested area. I argue in the paper that
   longitudinal studies are uniquely placed to inform the debate, and by
   focusing on this particular study the aim is to demonstrate the kind of
   contribution that can be made.

AB The growth in science understanding and reasoning of 12 children is
   being traced through their primary school years. The paper reports
   findings concerning children's growing understandings of evaporation,
   and their changing responses to exploration activities, that show the
   complexity and coherence of learning pathways. Children's responses to
   identical explorations of flight, separated by two years, are used to
   explore the interactions between conceptual knowledge and scientific
   reasoning, and the manner in which they change over this time. The
   paper discusses the particular insights afforded by a longitudinal
   study design, and some attendant methodological issues.

AB This paper will report on the development of a research program by a
   group of science educators at Kristianstad University, which has its
   roots in a longitudinal study I conducted concerning students'
   developing understandings of ecological processes. Following the
   insights generated in this first study concerning the nature of student
   understandings, and the potential of the longitudinal design, a
   research group has developed at Kristianstad which has extended this
   work into related areas. This paper will describe my own work and its
   development, and link it with three projects that use a longitudinal
   design, which we have subsequently undertaken and in some cases
   completed. The emphasis within the paper will be on the findings
   generated by these studies on student learning and response to science,
   and the particular features of the longitudinal design that allow such
   insights to emerge. The paper will explore patterns of change, and
   continuity, as a way of appreciating the particular contributions of
   longitudinal studies.

AB In this paper I describe and discuss the way that a book I had written
   on a five-year longitudinal study of school science teaching was
   received by the pupils and teachers it featured. By and large the
   pupils' reception was positive. However, one group of teachers was
   deeply hurt by the book. I trace this mainly to my failure to consider
   adequately their fears of the consequences of the book's publication
   and possibly to my failure to consider with them the psychological
   significance of my withdrawing from the school after five years of
   regular study. I hope that there are lessons not only for myself but
   also for others considering longitudinal and ethnographic research in
   science education and more broadly.

   We use the studies that other articles in this issue describe to
   illustrate these aspects. The illustrations range from attempts to
   promote long-term change through experimental teaching to
   investigations that describe change without intending to affect it. For
   both experimental and descriptive studies we discuss the validity of
   conclusions and insights, and how threats to validity may be reduced or
   eliminated. We highlight implications for teaching and the curriculum,
   and for the conduct of research. We describe the practicalities of
   longitudinal research, referring to time, resources, management of
   data, and attrition of subjects, and end with a summary of reasons why
   longitudinal studies are valuable.

AB This evaluation study investigated the effects of a teacher-centered
   versus student-centered computer-assisted instruction (CAI) on 10th
   graders' earth science student learning outcomes. This study also
   explored whether the effects of different forms of computer-assisted
   instruction (CAI) on student learning outcomes were influenced by
   student preferences of learning environment (PLE). A total of 347
   10th-grade senior high school students participated in this
   nonequivalent control group quasiexperiment. During a one-week period,
   one group of students (n = 216) were taught by a teacher-centered CAI
   (TCCAI) model whereas the other group of students (n = 131) were
   subject to a student-centered CAI (SCCAI) method. Results showed that
   (a) no statistically significant difference on students' earth science
   achievement was found for either group; (b) TCCAI, group had
   significantly better attitudes toward earth science than did the SCCAI
   group; furthermore (c) a significant PLE-treatment interaction was
   found on student attitudes toward the subject matter, where the
   teacher-centered instructional approach seemed to enhance more positive
   attitudes of less constructivist-oriented learning preferences
   students, whereas the student-centered method was more beneficial to
   more constructivist-oriented learning preferences students on their
   attitudes toward earth science in a computer-assisted learning
   environment. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In this paper, we draw from a narrative life history approach to report
   in depth on the experiences of one teacher, Shagufta, in a high-poverty
   urban elementary school in Lahore, Pakistan. The purpose of reporting
   Shagufta's story is twofold. First, we want to make sense of her role
   as a science teacher-what should the children in her school learn in
   science, and why, if these children are expected by Pakistani society
   to leave formal education before the eighth grade? Second, what core
   tensions mark Shagufta's story as she has tried to craft her science
   teaching practice? (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Using the contextual model of learning to understand visitor learning

SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MUSEUM; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN
AB Falk and Dierking's Contextual Model of Learning was used as a
   theoretical construct for investigating learning within a free-choice
   setting. A review of previous research identified key variables
   fundamental to free-choice science learning. The study sought to answer
   two questions: (1) How do specific independent variables individually
   contribute to learning outcomes when not studied in isolation? and (2)
   Does the Contextual Model of Learning provide a useful framework for
   understanding learning from museums? A repeated measure design
   including inter-views and observational and behavioral measures was
   used with a random sample of 217 adult visitors to a life science
   exhibition at a major science center. The data supported the contention
   that variables such as prior knowledge, interest, motivation, choice
   and control, within and between group social interaction, orientation,
   advance organizers, architecture, and exhibition design affect visitor
   learning. All of these factors were shown to individually influence
   learning outcomes, but no single factor was capable of adequately
   explaining visitor learning outcomes across all visitors. The framework
   provided by the Contextual Model of Learning proved useful for
   understanding how complex combinations of factors influenced visitor
   learning. These effects were clearerest when visitors were segmented by
   entry conditions such as prior knowledge and interest. (c) 2005 Wiley

TI Scientific literacy and discursive identity: A theoretical framework
   for understanding science learning
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID EDUCATION; STUDENT; REFORM; SENSE
AB In this paper we propose the construct of discursive identity as a way
   to examine student discourse. We drew from the work of Gee (2001,
   Review of Research in Education, 25, 99-125) and Nasir and Saxe (2003,
   Educational Researcher, 32(5),14-18) to consider the multiple contexts
   and developmental timescales of student discursive identity
   development. We argue that theories of scientific literacy need to
   consider the sociocultural contexts of language use in order to examine
   fully affiliation and alienation associated with appropriation of
   scientific discourse. As an illustrative case, we apply discursive
   identity to series of short exchanges in a fifth-grade classroom of
   African-American students. The discussion examines potential
   co-construction of student identity and scientific literacy. (c) 2005

   FRAMEWORK
AB Two seemingly complementary trends stand out currently in school
   science education in the United States: one is the increased emphasis
   on inquiry activities in classrooms, and the other is the high level of
   attention given to student understanding of the nature of science. This
   essay looks at the range of activities that fall within the first
   trend, noting, in particular, the growing popularity of inquiry
   activities that engage students in engineering-type tasks. The
   potential for public disengagement from science and technology issues
   is described as a result of the continued juxtaposition of these sorts
   of inquiry activities with our current, idealized portrayals of the
   nature of science-the emphasis of the second trend. Drawing on Dewey's
   instrumental theory of knowledge, an alternative way of thinking about
   science is offered that would not only provide for a more authentic
   understanding of science, but also invite much needed public
   participation in the broad governance of science in modern-day
   democratic societies. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The main purpose of this study was to explore the effects of long-term
   constructivist-oriented science instruction on elementary school
   students' process of constructing cognitive structures. Furthermore,
   such effects on different science achievers were also investigated. The
   subjects of this study were 69 fifth graders in Taiwan, while they were
   assigned to either a constructivist-oriented instruction group or a
   traditional teaching group. The research treatment was conducted for 5
   months, including six instructional units, and students' cognitive
   structures were probed through interviews coupled with a "metalistening
   technique" after the instruction of each unit. The interview narratives
   were transcribed into the format of "flow maps." In addition, the
   information processing modes shown in the flow maps were also
   investigated through a series of content analyses. The findings showed
   that the students in the constructivist-oriented instruction group
   attained significantly better learning outcomes in terms of the extent
   and integration of their cognitive structures, metacognition
   engagement, and the usage of information processing strategies.
   Moreover, it was also revealed that both high achievers and low
   achievers benefited from the constructivist-oriented instructional
   activities, but in different ways. For example, both high achievers and
   low achievers in the constructivist-oriented instruction group attained
   better usage of information processing strategies than their
   counterparts in traditional teaching group did; but only high achievers
   displayed better usage of higher order information processing modes
   (i.e., inferring or explaining) than their counterparts in traditional
   teaching group did. The results in this study finally suggest a
   four-stage model for students' process of constructing cognitive
   structure under the constructivist-oriented science instruction,
   including "cognitive structure acquisition," "metacognition
   enrichment," "cognitive structure integration," and "cognitive
   structure refinement." (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

SO SCIENCE EDUCATION

DT Article
ID SCIENCE; SCIENTISTS
AB The purpose of this study was to understand how the professor, teaching
   assistant, and students experienced inquiry-based science instruction
   in an undergraduate physics course designed for elementary education
   majors. During the teaching of a 6-week electricity unit, the professor
   faced several challenges: knowing when and how to tell the
   scientifically accurate answer, deciding when and how to introduce
   scientific terminology, and doing inquiry vs. testing. The professor
   and the teaching assistant also experienced several tensions. Their
   orientations to science teaching differed in terms of their science
   learning goals, beliefs about teaching and learning, and beliefs about
   assessment. The students experienced frustration with the-inquiry
   approach related to their views of learning, their need as learners to
   get the right answer, and the disconnect they felt between the inquiry
   approach and the assessment used in the course. During the course they
   were also building their-views of inquiry and their visions of
   themselves as future teachers. We analyze the conflicts experienced by
   the professor and among the professor, teaching assistant and students
   in terms of three orientations to science teaching: didactic,
   discovery, and guided inquiry. Finally, we discuss implications for
   building a guided inquiry orientation in science content courses for
   future teachers. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   at Ultralab for students engaged on masters-level programmes, doctoral
   research and continuing professional learning. It considers the ways in
   which the engagement of learners, and their consequent participation,
   is seen to be dependent on several factors-the learners' perception of
   purpose, their sense of identity and trust, framing of learning
   activities, interventions from learning facilitators and tutors, and
   the information architecture of the learning space. The notion of
   engagement in this online community in higher education (HE) is
   explored. The term 'community of enquiry' is used to indicate the key
   purpose of the community-that of practitioner-based enquiry, or
   research.

DT Article
AB This explores the constructivist understanding that shared practitioner
   research in collaborative online spaces leads to deeper learning. The
   research was developed within the context of building the National
   College of School Leadership's (NCSL's) online learning communities. A
   community and a learning scale, both emerging through grounded
   analysis, are applied to six conversations across both formal and
   informal learning contexts. When representing the findings, a strong
   similarity in the community and learning graphs suggests an association
   between the two. Recommendations point to the importance of building
   collaboration and community, integrating formative assessment, and
   freeing the learning-facilitator from tasks that the community can
   fulfil, so that they can focus on their primary role of facilitating
   quality learning.

AB Traditionally our UK higher education establishments have majored on a
   lecturer instructing a group of students. The focus has been very much
   on transferring a body of knowledge to a set of learners using a
   variety of teaching methods. The target in many establishments has been
   on the individual learner and their performance. Conversation, when
   used was a means of clarifying the learning that had been set by the
   teacher. With the advent of online teaching and learning this mould
   might be challenged. Can we develop another approach? This article
   looks at some of the ways in which the design and practices of Talk 2
   Learn, an online community, may reflect the thinking of Wenger and
   Vygotsky. It also begins to explore through the Talk 2 Learn example
   why it can be a useful addition to the traditional UK higher education
   models of learning.

SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The rapid development of the Internet as a means of both information
   distribution and social communication seems to be carrying with it a
   growing imperative for tertiary institutions to put teacher education,
   like many other things, 'online'. Often this is done in the name of
   offering teacher training to distant students who would otherwise not
   be able to undertake such study. Sometimes it is done in the name of
   'growing' the financial base of the institution. Sometimes it is done
   in the name of teacher or learner convenience, or more efficient use of
   lecturer or student time. But increasingly it is also becoming done in
   the name not just of more accessible, but of qualitatively improved
   pedagogy-or in a higher education context should one talk of andragogy?
   This paper reports some action research we conducted on our own initial
   experiences of incorporating 'online' elements into our respective
   teacher education courses. They have been experiences which have seen
   us confront issues which go well beyond technical questions of how to
   teach in a virtual environment, to encompass more value-laden
   self-enquiries about why we should, and the relationship, if there is
   to be one, between virtual teaching and virtuous teaching.

AB When we think about assessment using digital technologies, we often
   assume this means the introduction of computer-based tests. There are,
   however, other ways of using assessment for learning in which
   technology can play a useful and important role. This paper will
   discuss an innovative project, eVIVA, which uses mobile phones and the
   Internet to support formative assessment. The eVIVA project is
   currently being piloted by Ultralab, a learning and technology research
   unit at Anglia Polytechnic University, in schools across the UK. The
   initial pilot came to an end on 31 July 2003 but the project was then
   extended until July 2004. The chapter, reporting on the findings of the
   initial pilot, will discuss the development of the process, the
   responses of students and teachers to this new approach, and the
   implications of the project for developing a more student-centred
   approach to assessment and learning, and how this might impact on
   higher education.

SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Psychosocial risk factors for poor health show that we are highly
   sensitive to particular dimensions of the social and work environments.
   Central is the contrast between mutually supportive collaborative
   relationships versus stressful relationships of social dominance-in the
   workplace and at home. These social ordeals can exacerbate the effect
   of environmental pressures and risks (noise, pollution, disruptions).
   Helping the individual learner to identify and work collaboratively
   with the salient issues is difficult, especially in the classroom where
   issues may be too personally experienced. A dynamic, interactive
   e-learning environment, on the other hand, offers more scope for
   exploring issues at a safe distance, while promoting individual and
   group enquiry and the formation of intellectual relationships. However,
   it is argued here that a new approach to e-learning is needed, to
   afford the kinds of experiences necessary for learning about complex
   and sensitive issues.

AB The goal of personalised eLearning is to support e-learning content,
   activities and collaboration, adapted to the specific needs and
   influenced by specific preferences of the learner and built on sound
   pedagogic strategies. One of the major challenges to the mainstream
   adoption of personalised eLearning is the complexity and time involved
   in composing the adaptive learning experience. The key goal in
   personalized eLearning development tools is to sup-port the teacher in
   composing adaptive and non-adaptive eLearning experiences. One of the
   arguments of this paper is that these learning experiences should be
   activity-oriented and pedagogically driven. Presented is a detailed
   discussion of the challenges of composing adaptive courses and in
   particular the difficulties and possible techniques in composing
   appropriate models and information to support adaptive courses. The
   paper describes an adaptive course construction methodology which
   extends traditional eLearning syllabi development with design
   activities which support adaptivity definition, subject matter concept
   modelling, adaptivity technique selection as well as alternative
   instructional design template customisation. The paper then details the
   Adaptive Course Construction Toolkit ( ACCT), which supports this
   methodology and illustrates the tools usage in the development of an
   adaptive course. Finally the paper presents an initial evaluation of
   the toolkit and its associated methodology.

AB Educational Adaptive Hypermedia Applications (EAHA) provide
   personalized views on the learning content to individual learners. They
   also offer adaptive sequencing (navigation) over the learning content
   based on rules that stem from the user model requirements and the
   instructional strategies. EAHA are gaining the focus of the research
   community as a means of alleviating a number of user problems related
   to hypermedia. However, the difficulty and complexity of developing
   such applications and systems have been identified as possible reasons
   for the low diffusion of Adaptive Hypermedia in web-based education.
   Experience from traditional Software Engineering as well as Hypermedia
   Engineering suggests that a model-driven design approach is appropriate
   for developing applications where such requirements and constraints
   occur. This paper presents on a model-driven design process of EAHA.
   This process accords to the principles of hypermedia engineering and
   its innovation is the use of a formally specified object oriented
   design model.

AB So far educational adaptive technologies have proven their
   effectiveness only in small-scale lab courses, thus they still wait for
   being released to the large community of educators. Among the reasons,
   there is the difficult task of designing and authoring an interactive
   adaptive course, especially for non-technical group of educators. In
   this paper we present VIDET, a visual authoring tool for designing
   web-based adaptive courses with the ADLEGO adaptive engine. The
   authoring tool is tailored to the community of nontechnical
   instructors. It is pedagogic-neutral, allowing to define several
   different instructional strategies. The VIDET tool was implemented as a
   prototype in Macromedia Flash. Some results from a summative evaluation
   are available: the tool is effective at reducing the instructor's
   burden for creating structured adaptive courses. The basic set of
   adaptive techniques available is complete enough to support several
   different application scenarios.

AB Adaptation techniques can be applied not only to the multimedia
   contents or navigational possibilities of a course, but also to the
   assessment. In order to facilitate the authoring of adaptive free-text
   assessment and its integration within adaptive web-based courses,
   Adaptive Hypermedia techniques and Free-text Computer Assisted
   Assessment are combined in what could be called Adaptive Computer
   Assisted Assessment of Free-text Answers. This paper focuses on the
   integration of this type of assessment within adaptive courses, as well
   as on the presentation of an authoring tool able to manage the
   insertion and modification of different question statements and
   reference answers for open-ended questions. The results of the
   evaluation of this tool with course authors show the feasibility of
   proposing and evaluating open-ended questions adapted to each student,
   as well as that of getting a better model of the student's progress.

AB SIETTE is a web-based adaptive testing system. It implements
   Computerized Adaptive Tests. These tests are tailor-made, theory-based
   tests, where questions shown to students, finalization of the test, and
   student knowledge estimation is accomplished adaptively. To construct
   these tests, SIETTE has an authoring environment comprising a suite of
   tools that helps teachers create questions and tests properly, and
   analyze students' performance after taking a test. In this paper, we
   present this authoring environment in the framework of adaptive
   testing. As will be shown, this set of visual tools, that contain some
   adaptable features, can be useful for teachers lacking skills in this
   kind of testing. Additionally, other systems that implement adaptive
   testing will be studied.

AB This paper describes the use of adaptation patterns in the task of
   formulating standards for adaptive educational hypermedia (AEH) systems
   that is currently under investigation by the EU ADAPT project. Within
   this project, design dimensions for high granularity patterns have been
   established. In this paper we focus on detailing lower granularity
   adaptive patterns based upon learning styles. Several patterns from
   existing AEH system case studies are identified and classified
   according to an extended learning style "onion" model. This model forms
   the basis of a learning style taxonomy, introduced here, whose
   components determine adaptation patterns for AEH. These patterns are of
   importance both for authoring, as well as for interfacing between
   adaptive hypermedia systems. From an authoring point of view, these
   patterns may be used to establish a fine-grain approach to
   instructional strategies that can be implemented in AEH systems, as a
   response to a particular learning style. The implementation of this
   adaptation pattern taxonomy is discussed, both generally and in detail.

   essay draws from theoretical developments both within and external to
   the field of Educational Technology to articulate a systems definition
   of Educational Technology in Society. A systems definition of
   Educational Technology in Society is characterized as a goal oriented
   problem-solving approach utilizing tools, techniques, theories, and
   methods from multiple knowledge domains to: (1) design, develop, and
   evaluate, human and mechanical resources efficiently and effectively in
   order to facilitate and leverage all aspects of learning, and (2) guide
   change agency and transformation of educational systems and practices
   in order to contribute to influencing change in society. This paper
   offers valuable theoretical grounding to help guide researchers and
   leaders in the field.

AB This paper explores the assimilation gap, the gap between the
   acquisition of a technology and its deployment, in higher education
   teaching. The relevant literature covers three themes: technology
   diffusion, the technology acceptance model and task-technology fit. To
   explore the significance of these models to a teaching environment case
   study research was undertaken within a university college in north-west
   England. Using an ethnographic approach, with semi-structured
   interviews, lecturers' attitudes to the adoption of ICT were surfaced.
   Then the data collected was analysed by categorising the findings. One
   technique used to present these findings is the translation of the
   dialogue of each respondent into another character. This defamiliarised
   the taken for granted aspects of the informants' response. Using this
   method respondents were categorised using two metaphors suggesting that
   staff can be classified within two different cultures. The first
   metaphor is that of the Frontier where the adoption of ICT is seen as
   an exploration and the discourse used relates to the relative desire
   for adoption of ICT. The second metaphor is that of the Frontline where
   the view of ICT adoption centres on attack and defence and the
   discourse relates to the differences in the perceived ease of adoption.

ID CONCEPT MAPS; STRUCTURAL KNOWLEDGE; BIOLOGY
AB Concept maps are widely used in education, and have been acclaimed for
   their excellent results. For efficiently using concept maps in
   education, computer-based concept mapping systems have been developed.
   However these computer-based concept mapping systems are limited in
   their assessment algorithms. The assessment takes only concept nodes as
   the primary basis, with relation links playing only a minor role. To
   address this problem, this study proposes a new style of concept map,
   called the weighted concept map, which assigns a weight to each
   proposition in a concept map to represent its importance. This study
   proposes a new assessment based on a weighted concept map and diagnosis
   analysis. Two studies are conducted to evaluate the methods of
   assessment.

AB One of the most important decisions to be made in a face-to-face
   collaborative learning activity is how the participating groups are
   composed. These compositions produce different learning and social
   interaction results. The ability to change the group member composition
   in real time and dynamically enables the leveling up of learning
   results and improvements in the participants' social relationships.
   Changes in composition also facilitate the analysis of the best
   criteria to be used in a determined activity. We propose a face-to-face
   collaborative environment supported by wireless handhelds that allows
   for dynamic changes in the composition of groups while an activity is
   underway. Three different group composition changes were carried out in
   one environment and the outcomes were compared with another, similar
   environment where no such group composition changes were performed. The
   results obtained showed significant improvements, both qualitative and
   quantitative, in the environment where dynamic grouping was used.
   Moreover, the criteria for group composition that produce different
   social interaction outcomes were identified.

AB In many organizations, collaborating with peers, sharing resources, and
   codifying know-how are not typical facets of work activity. For such
   organizations, knowledge management support must help people identify
   and orient to opportunities for collaboration and sharing, articulate
   values and best practices, and assimilate sharing knowledge as an
   everyday experience. We discuss a participatory design project in which
   we are exploring these issues in the design of knowledge management

AB This article profiles an educational technology assistance program
   titled Digital Language and Literacy, linking technologically literate
   graduate students in English with faculty developing online courses for
   the first time. Our reporting and assessment process includes the
   narrative evidence of two faculty and two graduate student
   instructional designers, chronicling the possibilities and constraints
   of implementing a team-development model for online course design and
   offering guidelines for academic units wishing to adopt similar models.
   Such models not only help with online course design but also help to
   establish technological and pedagogical learning communities among
   current and future faculty. Because these models have also been
   successful in business organizations through both reverse mentoring and
   communities of practice, we outline how they can positively impact
   faculty and graduate students within academic structures that are
   highly hierarchical and protective of instructional expertise and
   authority.

TI A model for content and communication management in synchronous learning
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE communication and interaction model; synchronous computer supported
   collaborative learning (CSCL); content management system (CMS)
AB Asynchronous web-based learning environments are not usually as
   interactive or adaptive compared to traditional classrooms. The use of
   synchronous communication tools may be a solution to recreating the
   link between students and professors. However, synchronous
   collaborative learning environments are often restricted to a set of
   communication tools and they do not offer any strategy to organize
   interactions and communications among users. This paper proposes a
   model called CCMS (Content and Communication Management System) to
   structure synchronous collaboration activities within a group of
   distributed learners. This model represents synchronous communications
   and organizes interactions in a way suitable for both network oriented
   implementations and pedagogical strategic development. This view aims
   to offer an understandable representation of synchronous collaborative
   activities for the different communities. This article provides the
   specifications for the implementation of a system according to our
   proposed model. It also analyses the drawbacks of some web-based
   learning environments and describes how the nature of the model
   provides new opportunities to overcome these problems. Upon
   implementation, educators would be able to structure communication and
   to define interaction strategies for their synchronous activities
   according to the representations of the object model.

AB Learning technology is seen as one solution to the problem of
   delivering management training in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises
   (SMEs). This paper investigates how the Higher Education (HE) sector
   can use its growing expertise in learning technology implementation to
   develop effective SME management development solutions. It is found
   that there is potential for the development of new learning
   technologies by business schools for use in SMEs, but the process is
   complicated by the need to ensure materials are adapted to the SME
   learning context. This is explored through the development of the
   Learning Technology Practice Framework (LTPF), leading to five key
   recommendations for HE educators, learning technology developers, SME
   trainers and public funding bodies to consider.

TI Achieving E-learning with IMS learning design - Workflow implications
   at the Open University of the Netherlands
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE standardisation; authoring tools and methods; distance education;
   distributed learning environments; interactive learning environments
AB This paper uses the Open University of the Netherlands as an
   instructive case for the introduction of e-learning based on the IMS
   Learning Design specification ( IMS LD). The IMS LD specification, as
   approved by the IMS Global Learning Consortium in 2003, enables the
   specification and encoding of learning scenarios that describe any
   design of a teaching-learning process, i.e. support events, exchanges
   of projects, interactions and communications between participants. In
   2004, after several years of small-scale pilots, the Open University of
   the Netherlands launched IMS LD-based online learning in an operational
   setting ( over 3000 students). Rather than technology, the paper
   describes the implications for the workflow. The paper explains the
   processes involved with both IMS LD-based course creation and course
   delivery. Preliminary findings establish severe inconveniences for
   developers in the process of course creation, due to immature IMS LD
   tooling. Tutors, however, comment positively on course delivery, in
   particular on the way IMS LD supports course logistics, i.e. the
   arrangement of course runs, the control of student groups, tracking the
   students' progress and the support to the exchange of messages and
   papers. Even though the applied IMS LD-models were deliberately kept
   simple with respect to interactions and methods, students for their
   part appreciated the online courses, in particular the functionalities
   typically enabled by IMS LD, like personalised flow, tailored feedback
   and portfolios. In sum, taking for granted the immature tooling, the
   IMS LD specification seems to work in large-scale operational settings.

DE course delivery; IMS learning design; distance education; architectures
   for educational technology systems
AB Distance Learning Providers serve large populations of learners,
   frequently offering the same course to different groups of learners
   over lengthy periods of time. This article argues that (re-) running
   e-learning courses with different combinations of learners and staff
   requires a distinction between abstract representations of courses and
   instances of these representations involving specific learners and
   support staff. The article provides an analysis of the requirements for
   multiple deliveries of courses, describes the design of an approach
   which meets these requirements together with experiences resulting from
   implementation of the design. The article concludes with a discussion
   of the approach.

TI Design criteria for work-based learning: Merrill's first principles of
   instruction expanded
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In multinational corporations, new models of learning are developing. A
   particular model with direct applications for challenges facing
   distributed workforces is one that combines the strengths of formal and
   informal learning while focusing on participants' work-based tasks. An
   operationalisation of this model in the context of the ongoing
   professional development of the engineers, geologists, and other
   technical specialists in a multinational oil company (Shell EP) is
   described. Important for the quality control and continual improvement
   of the implementation of the model is a set of criteria for the design
   and evaluation of courses reflecting its work-based learning approach.
   Merrill's First Principles of Instruction (2002) form a starting point
   for such a model, but need to be expanded to reflect the particular
   needs of the Shell EP context. This article presents the expansion of
   Merrill's First Principles as the Merrill + design and evaluation
   criteria for courses with work-based activities for technical
   professionals and demonstrates how the criteria can be applied through
   a selection of some results of evaluations of more than 60 of the Shell
   EP courses using a course-scan methodology based on the Merrill +
   criteria. Implications of use of the Merrill + criteria for design and
   evaluation are discussed.

DT Article
ID DISABILITIES
AB The aim of this study was to ascertain whether collaborative group work
   on a computer, facilitated by an adult, could provide a means for a
   primary schoolboy with Asperger's Syndrome (AS)-moderately-highly
   affected in all areas of the "triad of impairments"-to develop
   appropriate task-related interactions with his peers. Data were
   gathered before, during, and after group work sessions. A combination
   of interviews and questionnaires established background data and
   concerns of parent and teachers. Sociometric testing of classmates was
   used to determine social acceptance and friendship grouping among the
   child's immediate peer group. During the adult-facilitated ICT sessions
   an interaction process schedule (IPS) was used to record interactions
   of the three children involved. The results indicate moderate
   improvements in the child's ability to interact with his peers, both in
   social and task-related contexts, as well as a raised social profile
   among his classmates in general. Although this was a discrete setting,
   the findings are encouraging and this strategy may be replicated in
   schools to support mainstream inclusion for children with AS.

ID QUESTIONNAIRE; VALIDITY
AB A shared document-based annotation tool was presented, and its
   usefulness in two different real-life web-based university-level
   courses (adult learners, n = 27 and adolescent learners, n = 23) was
   empirically investigated. The study design embodied three data
   collection phases: (1) a pretest measuring self-rated motivation,
   learning strategies, and social ability; (2) log file data analysis
   showing actual use of the system features; and (3) a posttest in a form
   of an email survey. For both groups, the results showed that the level
   of motivation has a positive effect on activity in the system and the
   final grade. The learners, who reported to have good time-management
   strategies, were the most active users of the system. The level of
   social ability predicted both the number of consecutive comments in the
   documents and the threads in document-related newsgroup discussions.
   Log file data analysis showed that user activity in the system was
   positively related to the final grade in both samples. Results of the
   posttest showed that all the respondents agreed when asked: (1) if the
   system brought added value to the learning process; (2) if the use of
   the system changed their studying habits favourably; and (3) if they
   would like to use the system in other courses.

TI Online tutorial support in open and distance learning: students'
   perceptions
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The Open University of Hong Kong (OUHK) offers 199 courses with online
   features to enhance the distance learning environment. The university
   has arranged these courses to provide students with greater flexibility
   in interacting with tutors, classmates, and the content itself.
   Integral to learner flexibility online is access, valuing computers and
   online learning, endorsement, and language proficiency. The current
   investigation attempts to explore these issues by examining the
   perceptions of OUHK students enrolled in courses with online tutorial
   supports. The methods of questionnaire survey and semi-structured
   interview were employed. Surveyed using multistage stratified sampling
   technique were 449 OUHK students enrolled in 18 upper level courses (9
   English, 9 Chinese) at the OUHK. Forty-two students were randomly
   selected for a follow-up interview. Five major topics were explored
   including: (1) accessing the Internet; (2) perceptions of technology;
   (3) rationale for using the Internet in course work; (4) learning
   strategies used by the tutor online; and (5) perceptions of the online
   tutorial support.

TI Broadband videoconferencing as a tool for learner-centred distance
   learning in higher education
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper outlines the possibilities for using broadband
   videoconferencing within the larger context of changing the focus for
   teaching from the teacher to the learners. It also explores
   opportunities that might be created by this technology to facilitate
   learner-centred engagement in learning and to provide new opportunities
   for collaboration and support for students studying by the distance
   mode. As part of the wider discussion, it presents a decision-making
   framework for teachers to consider when integrating videoconferencing
   into their curriculum. The bandwidths possible from broadband Internet
   connection rather than the integrated services digital network
   transmission increase the richness of videoconferencing to a much
   closer approximation of natural communication, thus creating
   opportunities for more creative uses for the medium. The outcomes of
   trials undertaken at the University of New England during the last two
   years provide the basis for predicting the usefulness of the technology
   for learner-centered interactions when the majority of students are
   learning from locations quite remote from the main campus.

TI Prompting conceptual understanding with computer-mediated peer
   discourse and knowledge acquisition techniques
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID HIGHER-EDUCATION; COMMUNICATION; STUDENTS; SYSTEM; CMC
AB Numerous computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools have been designed
   to facilitate group discourses on the Web. However, previous studies
   noted that participants did not value online conferencing as a method
   for conducting in-depth discussions, and instead considered this method
   as merely scratching the surface of the issues involved. Therefore, the
   teachers must moderate the online discourse to add value to the success
   of CMC. This study presents a methodology that uses knowledge
   acquisition techniques during online discourses to increase student
   conceptual understanding and evaluation skills. The methodology
   explains the conceptual frameworks of individuals and the conceptual
   relationships between student peers. Active database triggers then are
   applied to automatically monitor the conceptual relationships and to
   moderate online discourses between student peers. Student reactions
   demonstrated that discourses mediated by the repertory grid analysis
   technique helped group members not only promote common conceptual
   understandings but also to approach the level of conceptual
   understanding of the teacher.

TI A blended approach to learning: added value and lessons learnt from
   students' use of computer-based materials for neurological analysis
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines BSc Physiotherapy students' experiences of
   developing their neurological observational and analytical skills using
   a blend of traditional classroom activities and computer-based
   materials at the University of Birmingham. New teaching and learning
   resources were developed and supported in the School of Health Sciences
   using Web Course Tools combined with a wide range of video clips of
   patients with neurological disorders on CD-ROM. These resources
   provided students with the opportunity to observe "real patients" prior
   to clinical placements, thus bridging the gap between their theoretical
   understanding of these disorders and their practical experience of
   evaluating abnormal movement in the clinical setting. This paper
   considers how this blended approach to learning enhanced students'
   experiences of developing their neurological skills and of preparing
   for their clinical placements. This paper also discusses the lessons
   that have been gained from students' experiences to provide future or
   similar projects with the opportunity to learn from these experiences.

TI 'The visual helps me understand the complicated things': pupil views of
   teaching and learning with interactive whiteboards
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This study is one element of a government-sponsored evaluation into the
   introduction of interactive whiteboards (IWBs) to Years 5 and 6 in
   English primary schools. This element of the research aimed to gather
   information regarding pupil views of IWBs and the impact these tools
   can have on teaching and learning. To extend current literature, the
   method targeted pupils' views of how IWBs can impact on metacognition:
   thinking about learning. Using a template that has been developed by
   the Centre for Learning and Teaching at Newcastle University, pupils
   were encouraged to talk about learning in different contexts: this
   methodology and its rationale are described. The results show that
   overall comments from the pupils are positive, with the resulting
   themes encompassing how the IWB can facilitate and initiate learning
   and impact on preferred approaches to learning. The pupils describe how
   different elements of software and hardware can motivate, aid
   concentration, and keep their attention. On the negative side, pupils
   candidly describe their frustration when there are technical
   difficulties, their desire to use the board themselves and their
   perceptions of teacher and pupil effects. As IWBs are becoming more and
   more prevalent in schools, we discuss implications and make
   re-commendations for teachers and manufacturers.

ID TEACHER; PROGRAM
AB This article presents a case study of the use of digital video
   technology with a new pedagogical approach under a constructivist
   framework in an elementary school foreign language methods course. Data
   were collected through interviews with the methods course instructor,
   field notes, analytical notes from videotaped student presentations of
   their learning from the video clips, students' mid-semester evaluation
   of the use of video clips, and end-of-semester student reflections on
   open-ended questions regarding the use of video clips. A careful
   examination of the data identified themes that illustrate the
   characteristics of the use of digital video technology under a
   constructivist framework. Those themes include the flexibility and
   capability of digital video technology, the development of the video
   clips, students' ownership of knowledge, feedback from the students,
   and evaluation of the use of video clips. This case reports the vision
   of technology integration being realized. It results from the presence
   of technology, the instructor's pedagogical knowledge, and his or her
   content expertise.

TI Checklist and context-bound evaluations of online learning in higher
   education
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A review is undertaken of what different commentators have written
   about the evaluation of educational courseware in higher education.
   Speculation is made on the reasons for the lack of such evaluations.
   The role of checklists for evaluating online courseware is discussed
   despite the acknowledged limitations. Checklists have been developed at
   Edith Cowan University specifically for assessing aspects of online
   pedagogical learning materials in higher education. These checklists
   are intended to be useful indicators of the areas where online learning
   materials are strong and identify areas that may be deficient rather
   than to arrive at a numeric score. The form of checklist proposed is a
   valuable screening device to use before undertaking a context-bound
   evaluation of courseware.
   Contextual evaluations are a complementary and valuable alternative to
   traditional forms of evaluation of educational courseware, such as
   checklists. A case is also made in this article for using a checklist
   developed for assessing aspects of online pedagogical learning
   materials in higher education. It is argued that, when used in
   conjunction with a context-bound approach, such checklists may be more
   useful in indicating the pedagogical quality of online learning
   materials.
   Quality of the instructional design remains an important consideration
   in evaluating courseware. Continuing comments and dissent are invited
   on the value of contextual evaluations of educational courseware to
   reinvigorate the debate over appropriate ways of evaluating online
   courseware that will provide helpful information for higher education.

AB Reading and writing book reviews play an important part in academic
   life, but little is known about how academics carry out these tasks.
   The aim of this research was to explore these issues with members of
   the editorial panels of the British Journal of Educational Technology.
   A questionnaire was used to determine: (1) how often these people read
   and wrote book reviews in general; (2) how useful they found them; and
   (3) what features they thought were important in book reviews. Thirty
   sets of responses were obtained (15 from each sex). Most respondents
   reported reading between one and five book reviews a month and writing
   between three and four a year. Overall, there was high agreement in
   what they thought were the important features of book reviews, but
   there were also wide individual differences. Men reported that book
   reviews were more useful than did women. The agreement obtained among
   the respondents supports the notion that book reviews can be viewed as
   an academic genre with measurable contents. This has implications for
   how they are written and how people might be taught to write them
   better.

   progressive inquiry model as a theoretical framework had a large impact
   on describing these principles. Furthermore, this article describes the
   two web-based software systems - Synergeia and FLE3 - that were
   developed in the project. Teachers evaluated this software in the light
   of two perspectives: user friendliness (ease of use) and user
   satisfaction (especially the pedagogical usability). It is concluded
   that the participants find the software easy to use. The user
   satisfaction ranges between good and average. Details about the
   different types of evaluation are reported in the paper. (c) 2005

AB Fifty-six teachers, from four European countries, were interviewed to
   ascertain their attitudes to and beliefs about the Collaborative
   Learning Environments (CLEs) which were designed under the Innovative
   Technologies for Collaborative Learning Project. Their responses were
   analysed using categories based on a model from cultural-historical
   activity theory [Engestrom, Y. (1987). Learning by expanding.- An
   activity-theoretical approach to developmental research. Helsinki:
   Orienta-Konsultit; Engestrom, Y., Engestrom, R., & Suntio, A. (2002).

   activity-theoretical study of expansive learning among middle school
   teachers. In G. Wells & G. Claxton (Eds.), Learning for life in the
   21st century. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers]. The teachers were positive
   about CLEs and their possible role in initiating pedagogical innovation
   and enhancing personal professional development. This positive
   perception held across cultures and national boundaries. Teachers were
   aware of the fact that demanding planning was needed for successful
   implementations of CLEs. However, the specific strategies through which
   the teachers can guide students' inquiries in CLEs and the assessment
   of new competencies that may characterize student performance in the
   CLEs were poorly represented in the teachers' reflections on CLEs. The
   attitudes and beliefs of the teachers from separate countries had many
   similarities, but there were also some clear differences, which are
   discussed in the article. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present paper describes a series of case studies of collaborative
   learning supported by two web-based learning environments: Synergeia2
   and FLE3. The case studies were conducted in Finland, Greece, Italy,
   and the Netherlands as a part of international project called
   Innovative Technologies for Collaborative Learning. The general aim of
   this investigation was to examine the cases in a detailed way, and to
   find possible indications that might explain success and difficulties
   related to implementation of web-based Collaborative Learning
   Environments. The specific aims of the present study were to
   investigate the nature of the students' and teachers' computer-mediated
   discourse, whether and to what extent the students and teachers
   actually used the knowledge types in Synergeia2 and FLE3-environments
   (resembling CSILE's thinking types); and finally, to what extent the
   use of knowledge types was connected to the content of knowledge
   produced by the students and the teachers. The results showed
   considerable differences in the nature of the discourse and
   difficulties in students' labelling of their own notes. It is suggested
   that the adoption and development of collaborative practices takes
   time: collaborative learning in web-based environments is best
   organized around long-lasting learning activities; instead of weeks,
   whole academic terms. Further, it is underlined that the selection of
   good sets of knowledge types is important. Software must allow teachers
   to construct appropriate sets of knowledge types. (c) 2005 Elsevier

AB The aim of the present study was to analyze teachers' pedagogical
   designs, plans of organized technology-supported, collective student
   inquiry. Ten teachers in Finland designed and implemented eight,
   inquiry-learning units ('designs') in 12 primary and secondary level
   classrooms in various subject domains. The guiding principles behind
   the designs were the objectives of progressive inquiry, such as
   facilitation of question- and explanation-driven learning, and the use
   of collaborative technology to support the sharing of knowledge. The
   participating teachers received substantial pedagogical training on
   these issues before the classroom implementations. The present study
   concentrated on examining three aspects in the teachers' pedagogical
   designs: solutions for supporting students' inquiry efforts,
   organization of collaboration, and the role given to the web-based
   Collaborative Learning Environment (CLE). The teachers experienced the
   use of CLE as a valuable new possibility to foster collaboration in
   classroom work, but there was much variation in the ways that the
   affordances of the system were utilized. The results indicated that it
   was a challenge for the teachers, especially in secondary level, to
   find appropriate methods for supporting students' inquiry efforts. The
   most difficult aim to achieve appeared to be the promotion of real
   collaborative knowledge building; the social arrangements of many
   designs still relied on rather individualistic ways of working. (c)

   cooperative/collaborative learning; cross-cultural projects; primary
   education; learning communities; collaborative writing
ID CLASSROOM
AB This paper introduces intersubjectivity as a concept playing a crucial
   role in collaborative tasks, even when performed between partners at a
   distance. Two 5th grade classes from two European countries (Italy and
   Greece), collaborated in writing fairytales inspired by philosophically
   relevant issues. The software supporting the task is an asynchronous
   virtual environment. Videos recorded in the Italian class and materials
   posted on the platform were analyzed using qualitative approaches and
   discourse analysis. The case-study discussed shows how the construction
   of intersubjectivity at a distance is a complex process involving many
   aspects. The main results highlight how participants: (a) use the
   narrative structure as a pre-requisite to build an intersubjective
   space where partners' representation plays an important role; (b)
   exploit to a high degree the intellectual reasoning needed to
   accomplish the task in a truly collaborative way; (b) attain a fine
   tuning of reflective and metacognitive skills fostering a genuine
   interdependency during the task. Within this process, computer
   mediation amplifies the partners' "presence" all through the creative
   writing process, expanding [Bruner, J., 2002. Making stories: law,
   literature, life. Farrar Straus & Giroux] definition of writing as an
   activity where the "audience" plays a fundamental role as a
   "co-author". (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This case study outlines the events of a recent summative
   computer-aided assessment (CAA) failure involving 280 first-year
   undergraduate students. Post-test analysis found that the central
   server had become unexpectedly overloaded, thereby causing the CAA to
   be abandoned. Practical advice on just what to do in the event of a
   summative CAA failure is virtually non-existent in the related
   literature. In response, this paper provides a detailed account of the
   post-failure analysis and recovery activities from a practitioner's
   (ie, academic) viewpoint. Supported by empirical evidence, the research
   shows how the concept of "optional substitution" was developed as a
   pragmatic, equitable, and broadly acceptable solution to the problem.

AB The paper presents a strategy for the systematic evaluation of course
   websites built under the project e3Learning that operates across three
   universities in Hong Kong. Tailor- made evaluation plans were produced
   for each website; the evaluation was conducted by an evaluation
   officer, and a report was provided to each teacher, thus supporting
   continuous development. To date, 58 cases of evaluation data have been
   collected. In this paper, a meta-analysis across these cases is
   presented in order to see which are the most useful web-assisted
   functions currently in use in Hong Kong universities. This study
   indicates the following four functions as being most useful: learning
   tools such as glossaries, notes and PowerPoints, assessment tasks
   associated with grades, and creation and exhibition of multimedia
   projects. The reasons for these rankings are postulated.

TI Building learning communities: foundations for good practice
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The School of Health Sciences at the University of Birmingham provided
   opportunities for the development of student learning communities and
   online resources within the neurological module of the BSc
   Physiotherapy degree programme. These learning communities were
   designed to facilitate peer and independent learning in core aspects
   underpinning clinical practice, thus laying the foundation for the
   development of effective clinical reasoning.
   This paper examines some of the problems that staff encountered,
   including the lessons that they learnt through the design, development,
   and implementation processes of the module, and the subsequent
   modifications that were made. Student experiences of this course are
   also included, as they provided staff with further insights into the
   ways in which these problems impacted upon their preparation for
   clinical practice and how the module might be improved for future
   cohorts. From an analysis of the problems that staff encountered and
   then sought to resolve, and of student experiences of the course, this
   paper identifies foundations for good practice in the development and
   delivery of innovative learning and teaching methods.

   aspects that emerged from Northumbria's experience - the application of
   models of innovation from both educational and business worlds, the
   need to take account of the impact of cultural change, the need for
   effective staff development for all stakeholders, the need for a ` road
   map' for the development, and the need for ongoing dialogue with
   clients ( staff) and customers ( students). It reflects upon how
   Northumbria's approach has led to the emergence of a learning
   organisation that is adaptive and responsive and how a business
   approach can be applied to higher and further education innovations.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
AB The beneficial effects of learners interacting in online programmes
   have been widely reported. Indeed, online discussion is argued to
   promote student-centred learning. It is therefore reasonable to suggest
   that the benefits of online discussion should translate into improved
   student performance. The current study examined the frequency of online
   interaction of 122 undergraduates and compared this with their grades
   at the end of the year. The findings revealed that greater online
   interaction did not lead to significantly higher performance for
   students achieving passing grades; however, students who failed in
   their courses tended to interact less frequently. Other factors that
   may be salient in online interactions are discussed.

AB This study addresses the need for research in three areas: (1)
   teachers' understandings of scientific inquiry; (2) conceptual
   understandings of evolutionary processes; and (3) technology-enhanced
   instruction using an inquiry approach. The purpose of this study was to
   determine in what ways The Galapagos Finches software-based materials
   created a context for learning and teaching about the nature of
   scientific knowledge and evolutionary concepts. The research used a
   design experiment in which researchers significantly modified a
   secondary science methods course. The multiple data sources included:
   audiotaped conversations of two focus pairs of participants as they
   interacted with the software; written pre- and posttests on concepts of
   natural selection of the 21 prospective teachers; written pre- and
   posttests on views of the nature of science; three e-mail journal
   questions; and videotaped class discussions. Findings indicate that
   prospective teachers initially demonstrated alternative understandings
   of evolutionary concepts; there were uninformed understandings of the
   nature of scientific inquiry; there was little correlation between
   understandings and disciplines; and even the prospective teachers with
   research experience failed to understand the diverse methods used by
   scientists. Following the module there was evidence of enhanced
   understandings through metacognition, and the potential for interactive
   software to provide promising context for enhancing content
   understandings. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate and compare level of
   understanding of eighth-grade students and student teachers in their
   final year in the science education department related to concepts of
   solution, gas, and chemical change. A qualitative and quantitative
   methodology was used for this investigation. Open-ended questions and
   group discussion methods were used for data collection. Moreover, to
   examine how students visualize these concepts, students were asked to
   make drawings. The questions were administered to 50 students in Grade
   8 and 50 student teachers in the science education department. Group
   discussions were conducted with 6 students and 6 student teachers.
   There were surprisingly similar alternative conceptions by both the
   students and the student teachers despite more instruction on these
   topics in the education of the student teachers. Based on the results,
   some suggestions are presented. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res

AB We studied the outcome of a professional development opportunity that
   consisted of 2-week-long resident institutes for teams consisting of a
   secondary science teacher and two students. The science content of the
   National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded professional development
   institute was monarch butterfly ecology. The first institute took place
   in Minnesota during the summer, and the second in Texas during the
   fall. Staff scientists provided intense instruction in inquiry, with
   numerous opportunities for participants to conduct short inquiry-based
   research projects. Careful attention was paid to introducing each step
   of the full inquiry process, from asking questions to presenting
   research findings. All participants conducted independent team full
   inquiry projects between the two institutes. Project findings show that
   the number of teachers providing opportunities for their students to
   conduct full inquiry increased significantly after their participation.
   A mixed-methodology analysis that included qualitative and quantitative
   data from numerous sources, and case studies of 20 teachers, revealed
   that the characteristics of the program that helped teachers
   successfully translate inquiry to their classrooms were: deep science
   content and process knowledge with numerous opportunities for practice;
   the requirement that teachers demonstrate competence in a tangible and
   assessable way; and providers with high expectations for learning and
   the capability to facilitate multifaceted inquiry experiences. (c) 2005

AB This study focuses on I I African American undergraduate seniors in a
   biology degree program at a predominantly white research institution in
   the southeastern United States. These I I respondents shared their
   journeys throughout the high school and college science pipeline.
   Participants described similar precollege factors and experiences that
   contributed to their academic success and persistence at a
   predominantly white institution. One of the most critical factors in
   their academic persistence was participation in advanced science and
   mathematics courses as part of their high school college preparatory
   program. Additional factors that had a significant impact on their
   persistence and academic success were family support, teacher
   encouragement, intrinsic motivation, and perseverance. (c) 2005 Wiley

SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING

ID CONCEPT-ACQUISITION; SCIENCE; HYPOTHESIS; ANALOGIES
AB A long-standing and continuing controversy exists regarding the role of
   induction and deduction in reasoning and in scientific inquiry. Given
   the inherent difficulty in reconstructing reasoning patterns based on
   personal and historical accounts, evidence about the nature of human
   reasoning in scientific inquiry has been sought from a controlled
   experiment designed to identify the role played by enumerative
   induction and deduction in cognition as well as from the relatively new
   field of neural modeling. Both experimental results and the
   neurological models imply that induction across a limited set of
   observations plays no role in task performance and in reasoning.
   Therefore, support has been obtained for Popper's hypothesis that
   enumerative induction does not exist as a psychological process.
   Instead, people appear to process information in terms of increasingly
   abstract cycles of hypothetico-deductive reasoning. Consequently,
   science instruction should provide students with opportunities to
   generate and test increasingly complex and abstract hypotheses and
   theories in a hypothetico-deductive manner. In this way students can be
   expected to become increasingly conscious of their underlying
   hypothetico-deductive thought processes, increasingly skilled in their
   application, and hence increasingly scientifically literate. (c) 2005

ID QUALITATIVE DIFFERENCES
AB This study investigates the case-based learning experience of 133
   undergraduate veterinarian science students. Using qualitative
   methodologies from relational Student Learning Research, variation in
   the quality of the learning experience was identified, ranging from
   coherent, deep, quality experiences of the cases, to experiences that
   separated significant aspects, such as the online case histories,
   laboratory test results, and annotated images emphasizing symptoms,
   from the meaning of the experience. A key outcome of this study was
   that a significant percentage of the students surveyed adopted a poor
   approach to learning with online resources in a blended experience even
   when their overall learning experience was related to cohesive
   conceptions of veterinary science, and that the difference was even
   more marked for less successful students. The outcomes from the study
   suggest that many students are unsure of how to approach the use of
   online resources in ways that are likely to maximise benefits for
   learning in blended experiences, and that the benefits from case-based
   learning such as authenticity and active learning can be threatened if
   issues closely associated with qualitative variation arising from
   incoherence in the experience are not addressed.

DE e-learning; interview; satisfaction; virtual learning environments
AB The use of virtual learning environments (VLEs) has become increasingly
   common in most higher education (HE) institutions. Recent developments
   have proposed the interoperability of software systems and content, to
   create component VLEs in contrast with the integrated, monolithic ones
   that are currently prevalent. This paper examines the student
   experience of two VLEs, one integrated approach and the other
   component. In general, students preferred the component system,
   although this may have been influenced by other factors such as
   performance. Although the study is limited to one cohort of student it
   makes a number of suggestions relevant to anyone deploying a VLE. These
   are that the component approach is a viable one from a student
   perspective, the broader context in which the VLE operates is important
   in student perception and that poor system performance may have
   unpredictable consequences for the learning experience.

DE electronic voting system; engagement; interactivity; lectures
AB This paper reports on the use of an electronic voting system (EVS) in a
   first-year computing science subject. Previous investigations suggest
   that students' use of an EVS would be positively associated with their
   learning outcomes. However, no research has established this
   relationship empirically. This study sought to establish whether there
   was an association between students' use of an EVS over one semester
   and their performance in the subject's assessment tasks. The results
   from two stages of analysis are broadly consistent in showing a
   positive association between EVS usage and learning outcomes for
   students who are, relative to their class, more correct in their EVS
   responses. Potential explanations for this finding are discussed as
   well as modifications and future directions of this program of research.

AB How to innovate information technology (IT) effectively in a
   technology-mediated learning (TML) environment remains a problem. To
   better understand how knowledge sharing (KS) and 'coordination and
   support of TML environment' (i.e. CTML) influence the propensity for
   TML innovation, this study develops a research framework to delineate
   the relationships among KS, CTML, and three antecedents of TML
   innovation - cognizance of technology, ability to explore TML, and
   intention to explore. In order to test the impact of KS and CTML on the
   propensity for TML innovation, we collected data from elementary
   schools of Taiwan through a survey instrument. Our results indicate
   that KS has a positive effect on all the three antecedents of TML
   innovation, while CTML exerts a positive impact only on instructors'
   ability to explore. The implications of the study are discussed, and
   future research directions are proposed.

   REPRESENTATION; DATABASES; IDENTITY
AB Knowledge exchange with shared databases can be seen as a public-goods
   dilemma. People are reluctant to contribute information because they
   save time, effort and perhaps social power if they withhold their
   knowledge and socially loaf. But if all people choose this individually
   efficient strategy, then no information exchange can take place, and
   the group is less effective than it would have been if all members
   contributed. Thus, in the knowledge-exchange situation, group norms and
   individual norms oppose each other.
   In order to strengthen people's orientation towards the group, virtual
   collaborative tools sometimes provide member portraits. But based on
   the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effect (SIDE)-Model,
   ambivalent effects of these member portraits are expected according to
   people's social categorization: when people identify more strongly with
   the group, such portraits enhance participation, whereas when people
   have a stronger individual identity, they undermine participation.
   This study links the concepts of social value orientation to identity
   salience. The assumption is that in the information-exchange dilemma,
   the social value orientation of a group member will determine whether
   group identity or individual identity becomes salient for that group
   member. We then extend the SIDE-model to the domain of social loafing
   and expect that portraits of the group members will have different
   effects for people with individual orientation and for people with
   prosocial orientation. An experiment confirmed this expectation and
   revealed a significant interaction between social value orientation and
   portraits. Especially striking is the result that for prosocials the
   provision of member portraits leads to an increase in social loafing.
   This is analogous to the predictions of the SIDE-model.

AB This study discusses the evolution of an instructional systems design
   (ISD) model that is based on an expanded view of Shulman's concept of
   pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). An initial model was evaluated in
   the first iteration of a design experiment, and then it was changed and
   assessed in two other iterations that followed. The proposed ISD model
   can be used in educational technology courses, elementary teacher
   education method courses, and teacher professional development courses
   to develop information and communication technology (ICT)-related PCK.
   ICT-related PCK comprises a body of knowledge that educators need to be
   able to teach with ICT. Evidence from the present study, with
   preservice elementary teachers, indicates that the evolved model was
   effective in developing some aspects of ICT-related PCK. Based on the
   results of the study, more systematic efforts are needed to engage
   preservice teachers in technology-rich design activities, so that they
   can adequately develop all aspects of ICT-related PCK. Finally, this
   study provides baseline data that can be used for comparison purposes
   in future studies that may be conducted to further validate or modify
   the suggested ISD model.

AB The results of this study show that effective questioning skills
   increase student intellectual moves that, in turn, facilitate the
   process of knowledge construction in online synchronous discussion
   (OSD). The open-ended questions elicited multiple perspectives by
   promoting student participation, while OSD enabled them to share and
   debate multiple perspectives simultaneously without worrying about
   interrupting the flow of a conversation that had moved on. Furthermore,
   the high level of questions engaged students in higher order thinking.
   That is, OSD can be productive for learning when organised with
   appropriate questioning skills. The implication is that educators have
   to re-engineer their thinking to teach with OSD in order to discover
   effective pedagogy that uses OSD as an integral component in teaching.
   Research on educational OSD should focus on how and when it is an
   appropriate learning tool that enhances learning processes and outcomes.

AB This study focuses on everyday or lay understandings of inheritance. In
   the northeastern Brazil, 100 individuals were interviewed in order to
   describe how they explain the origin of genetic disorders affecting
   their relatives for several generations. There were involved 60
   individuals from a large consanguineous family with many members
   affected with a neurodegenerative disorder, SPOAN syndrome (spastic
   paraplegia, optic atrophy and neuropathy), and 40 individuals of
   another family living with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The results
   indicate that families here studied have built narratives to explain
   the origin of genetic diseases, saying that an ancestor infected with
   syphilis gave rise to disorders and birthmarks transmitted to
   descendents. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 89:564 - 576, 2005.

AB The study examines how social and cultural factors mediate the teaching
   and learning of science in an Australian high school. Grade 10
   students, many of them new migrants, often transient and from
   circumstances of economic hardship, were taught a 5-week unit on
   chemistry by a teacher with social and cultural histories similar to
   those of most of her students. Structures that framed the enacted
   curriculum included the provision of well-equipped laboratories and
   supplies, and the teacher's emphasis on students building positive
   emotional energy, communities of learners, and science-related
   identities associated with success and interest in science. The teacher
   taught in ways that encouraged students to participate and succeed in
   learning science facts and concepts, experiencing science as relevant
   to everyday life, exploring significant social issues, and accurately
   following procedures to complete labs. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In the context of schooling, resiliency refers to the ability to thrive
   academically despite adverse circumstances. In this study the
   relationship between academic resilience and student's collateral
   learning is explored in 20 students of Cree ancestry. The individual
   resilience of each student was examined by identifying protective
   factors for school leaving within the microsystem of each student's
   ecological framework. Student responses to questions related to
   motivation and engagement were ranked. In addition, students'
   perception of the influence of family and peers on individual
   attributes toward schooling was ranked.
   To gain insight into the collateral learning aspects of science
   learning in Cree students, the participants in this study were asked to
   reflect on their learning strategies through the use of critical
   incidents. The relationship between collateral learning and resiliency
   was also explored.
   This study found that students possessing a greater number of
   protective factors were more likely to learn science in a way described
   by Jegede's collateral learning theory. Responses to critical incidents
   indicate some Cree students hold at least two sources of knowledge to
   explain some science concepts and therefore may adopt a collateral
   learning strategy. The importance these students place on earned or
   experiential knowledge is evident in the interviews. Some suggestions
   for classroom instruction are offered in conclusion. (c) 2005 Wiley

ID INFORMATION; INHERITANCE; STUDENTS
AB This research examined 9- to 15-year-old children's understandings
   about basic genetics concepts and how they integrated those
   understandings with their broader theories of biology. A
   cross-sectional case study method was used to explore the students' (n
   = 90) understandings of basic inheritance and molecular genetics
   concepts such as gene and DNA. Data were collected by interview and
   were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. A theoretical framework
   consisting of an ontological perspective and an epistemological
   perspective informed the data analysis. The results indicate that the
   majority of students had a theory of kinship because they could
   differentiate between socially and genetically inherited
   characteristics. While these students had heard of the concepts gene
   and DNA, a bona fide theory of genetics was elusive because they did
   not know where genes are or what they do. The discussion explores
   popular cultural origins of students' understandings and potential
   ontological and epistemological barriers to further learning about
   genetics. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 89:614-633, 2005.

AB Perceptions of mentors' practices related to primary science teaching
   from nine Australian universities (N = 331 final-year preservice
   teachers) were gathered through a literature-based instrument. Five
   factors that characterize effective mentoring practices in primary
   science teaching were supported by confirmatory factory analysis. These
   factors, namely, personal attributes, system requirements, pedagogical
   knowledge, modeling, and feedback, had Cronbach alpha coefficients of
   internal consistency reliability of .93, .76, .94, .95, and .92,
   respectively. Final model fit indexes were chi(2) = 1335, df = 513,
   CMIDF = 2.60, IFI = .922, CFI = .921, RMR = .066, RMSEA = .070 (p <
   .001). Specific mentoring interventions for improving primary science
   teaching practices may be implemented by measuring preservice teachers'
   perceptions of their mentoring with a valid and reliable instrument.

TI Coordination in coteaching: Producing alignment in real time
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB In coteaching, two or more teachers take collective responsibility for
   enacting a curriculum together with their students. Past research
   provided some indication that in the course of coteaching, not only the
   teaching practices of the partners become increasingly alike but also
   do unconsciously produced ways of moving about the classroom, hand
   gestures, and body movements. In this study, we investigate the
   possible sources of occurrence for the coordination of social and
   physical practices and provide exemplary episodes at a fine-grained
   level from one coteaching pair. Drawing on key concepts from cultural
   sociology, we show how participants continuously create material and
   social resources that allow for new forms of agency in subsequent
   moments. Such resources include physical, temporal, and social spaces
   and meaning-making entities (language, inscriptions). We show how in
   productive coteaching, participants deploy and take advantage of these
   resources in synchronized and coordinated ways. The synchronization
   operates both at the temporal level, where coteachers work in concert
   like experienced jazz musicians in a jam session, and at a substantive
   level, where the practices of one look like those of the other. As
   coteachers generally are not aware that they adopt the ways of their
   partners as we articulate them here, there are considerable
   consequences, for better or worse, that arise from teaching with
   another person. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 89:675-702,

SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES

DT Article
ID WORD-PROBLEMS; REPRESENTATIONS; MULTIPLICATION; COORDINATION; DIVISION;
   PHYSICS
AB This article extends and strengthens the knowledge in pieces
   perspective (diSessa, 1988, 1993) by applying core components to
   analyze how 5th-grade students with computational knowledge of
   whole-number multiplication and connections between multiplication and
   discrete arrays constructed understandings of area and ways of using
   representations to solve area problems. The results complement past
   research by demonstrating that important components of the knowledge in
   pieces perspective are not tied to physics, more advanced mathematics,
   or the teaming of older students. Furthermore, the study elaborates the
   perspective in a particular context by proposing knowledge for
   selecting attributes, using representations, and evaluating
   representations as analytic categories useful for highlighting some
   coordination and refinement processes that can arise when students
   learn to use external representations to solve problems. The results
   suggest, among other things, that explicitly identifying similarities
   and differences between students' past experiences using
   representations to solve problems and demands of new tasks can be
   central to successful instructional design.

TI Knowledge convergence in computer-supported collaborative learning: The
   role of external representation tools
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID DECISION-MAKING; CONSTRUCTION; STRATEGIES; CONFLICT
AB This study investigates how 2 types of graphical representation tools
   influence the way in which learners use knowledge resources in 2
   different collaboration conditions. In addition, the study explores the
   extent to which learners share knowledge with respect to individual
   outcomes under these different conditions. The study also analyzes the
   relation between the use of knowledge resources and different types of
   knowledge. The type of external representation (content specific vs.
   content independent) and the collaboration condition (videoconferencing
   vs. face to face) were varied. Sixty-four university students
   participated in the study. Results showed that learning partners
   converged strongly with respect to their use of resources during the
   collaboration process. Convergence with respect to outcomes was rather
   low, but relatively higher for application-oriented knowledge than for
   factual knowledge. With content-specific external representation,
   learners used more appropriate knowledge resources without sharing more
   knowledge after collaboration. Learners in the computer-mediated
   collaboration used a wider range of resources. Moreover, in exploratory
   qualitative and quantitative analyses, the study found evidence for a
   relation between aspects of the collaborative process and knowledge
   convergence.

AB This study investigated relationships between students' perceptions of
   their teachers' interpersonal behaviour and their subject-related
   attitude in primary science classes in Brunei. Teacher-student
   interpersonal behaviour was mapped with the Questionnaire on Teacher
   Interaction (QTI) and reported in terms of two independent dimensions
   called Influence ( teacher dominance vs submission) and Proximity (
   teacher cooperation vs opposition). While prior research using the QTI
   mainly focused on secondary education, the present study was one of the
   first in Brunei and in primary education and one of few studies to use
   multilevel analysis. Data from 1305 students from 64 classes were used
   in this study. Results indicated strong and positive effects of
   Influence and Proximity on students' enjoyment of their science class
   and supported findings of earlier work with the QTI.

TI Improving progression and continuity from primary to secondary science:
   Pupils' reactions to bridging work
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID NORTHERN-IRELAND; CURRICULUM
AB This article reports research from a project set up to implement
   'bridging work' in science in England. Group interviews of 59 pupils in
   Year 6 (at the end of primary school) and 48 pupils in Year 7 (at
   beginning of secondary school) were carried out after pupils had
   completed bridging work. Twenty-six of this sample were the same
   pupils. Semi-structured interviews were carried out in groups to
   ascertain: their aspirations and fears concerning secondary science,
   their reactions to bridging work and their memories of investigations.
   Year 6 pupils were positive about studying science at secondary school
   and remained so after transfer. Pupils' reactions to bridging at both
   ages were very positive. Findings challenge recent critiques of
   bridging. The lack of progression in pupils' communication about the
   variables and findings from investigations suggest that the planned
   progression of work was not recognized by some teachers. Bridging work
   alone may not guarantee improved progression and continuity in science,
   but as part of a carefully planned and structured programme of
   collaboration it has merit.

AB This article reports the results of an analysis of 1676 science and
   technology questions submitted by Israeli children to a series of
   television programmes. It categorizes the children's questions with
   reference to five different coding schemes: field of interest,
   motivation for asking the question, type of information requested,
   country-specific aspects, and source of information. The results point
   to the popularity of biology, technology, and astrophysics over other
   sciences, indicate a shift in interests and motivation with age, and
   reflect a variety of gender-related differences within the sample. The
   implications of the findings for some current trends in curriculum
   development and for informal science education are discussed with
   reference to the wider context of the pupils' voice in education.

ID SCIENCE PROCESS SKILLS
AB The aim of teaching science at secondary school level is that of
   achieving the scientific literacy of all citizens. This must involve
   diverse objectives, among which may be found the development of
   procedural skills ( hought, manipulative, communicative, etc.). The new
   curricula of many countries provide for these objectives. However, it
   is important to know to what extent the teaching staff consider them as
   true content to be taught. In this article, we analyse the opinions of
   secondary school teachers belonging to schools in north-western Spain
   with regard to how they value different types of procedures. Our
   findings show that the surveyed teachers establish differences between
   various procedural skills as far as the recognition of their presence
   in the classroom and their evaluation are concerned, although it may be
   said that they generally value procedural skills highly. These findings
   are discussed. In addition, the persistence of traditional conceptions
   in the teaching of science, as well as the difficulty of assuming that
   the changes promoted by new curricular approaches are addressed, are
   highlighted.

TI Design-based science and real-world problem-solving
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SELF-EXPLANATIONS; CLASSROOMS; STUDENTS; CHILDREN
AB Design-based science (DBS) is a science pedagogy in which new
   scientific knowledge and problem-solving skills are constructed in the
   context of designing artifacts. This paper examines whether the
   enactment of a DBS unit supported students' efforts to construct and
   transfer new science knowledge and 'designerly' problem-solving skills
   to the solution of a new real-world design problem in a real-world
   setting. One hundred and forty-nine students participated in the
   enactment of a DBS unit. Their understanding of the curricular content
   was assessed by identical pre-instructional and post-instructional
   written tests. They were then given a new design problem as a transfer
   task. There was a statistically significant increase on scores from
   pre-test to post-test with an effect size of 1.8. There was a stronger
   correlation between the scores of the transfer task and those of the
   post-test than with those of the pre-test; we use this finding to
   suggest that the knowledge that was constructed during the unit
   enactment supported the solution of the transfer task. This has
   implications for the development of science curricula that aim to lead
   to the construction of knowledge and skills that may be useful in
   extra-classroom settings. Whether participation in consecutive
   enactments of different DBS units increases transfer remains to be
   investigated in more depth.

ID SCHOOL-STUDENTS; CONSEQUENCES; IDEAS
AB A case study is presented describing the work of three pupils in the
   upper level of compulsory school. The pupils were learning about the
   intensified greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer. In
   their work, the need for certain domain-specific knowledge becomes
   apparent; for example, understanding such concepts as photosynthesis,
   radiation and catalyst. The results show that the pupils experienced
   difficulty in distinguishing between the different meanings attached to
   individual concepts in their theoretical and practical contexts. They
   are often unable to identify the meaning relevant to the specific
   environmental problem that they are working on. The pupils'
   difficulties are seen here as a problem of differentiation between
   concepts denoted by the same term as well as between different aspects
   of the same concept, a view that is then related to the question of
   appropriate conditions for conceptual change.

TI High-school students' reasoning while constructing plant growth models
   in a computer-supported educational environment
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PHOTOSYNTHESIS; IDEAS
AB This paper highlights specific aspects of high-school students'
   reasoning while coping with a modeling task of plant growth in a
   computer-supported educational environment. It is particularly
   concerned with the modeling levels ('macro-phenomenological' and
   'micro-conceptual' level) activated by peers while exploring plant
   growth and with their ability to shift between or within these levels.
   The focus is on the types of reasoning developed in the modeling
   process, as well as on the reasoning coherence around the central
   concept of plant growth. The findings of the study show that a
   significant proportion of the 18 participating dyads perform modeling
   on both levels, while their ability to shift between them as well as
   between the various elements of the 'micro-conceptual' level is rather
   constrained. Furthermore, the reasoning types identified in peers'
   modeling process are 'convergent', 'serial', 'linked' and 'convergent
   attached', with the first type being the most frequent. Finally, a
   significant part of the participating dyads display a satisfactory
   degree of reasoning 'coherence', performing their task committed to the
   main objective of exploring plant growth. Teaching implications of the
   findings are also discussed.

AB This article is a contribution to the characterization of teacher-pupil
   interactions during scientific inquiry. Attention is paid to conclusion
   phases, as it is at this point in the interaction that a pupil's
   production is to be accepted or rejected. Sixteen sessions taught by
   eight teachers in junior high schools and high schools were recorded,
   transcribed and analysed. In interpreting the teacher pupil
   interactions, the presence of hidden epistemological and pedagogical
   beliefs in the conclusion phases have been discerned. The conclusion
   phase corresponds to a dogmatic (versus constructivist) view of science
   and the teaching of science if the pupil's production is judged for its
   veracity in relation to the teacher's scientific knowledge (versus its
   validity in relation to knowledge shared by both pupil and teacher). A
   discussion follows on the conditions for the teacher's building a
   relationship between this aspect of his/her practice and his/her
   beliefs. The impact of this research on teacher training is also
   considered.

AB The study is aimed at investigating the effects of four learning
   methods on students' scientific inquiry skills. The four learning
   methods are: (a) metacognitive-guided inquiry within asynchronous
   learning networked technology ( MINT); (b) an asynchronous learning
   network (ALN) with no metacognitive guidance; (c) metacognitive-guided
   inquiry embedded within face-to-face (F2F) interaction; and (d) F2F
   interaction with no metacognitive guidance. The study examined general
   scientific ability and domain-specific inquiry skills in microbiology.
   Participants were 407 10th-grade students (15 years old). The MINT
   research group significantly outperformed all other research groups,
   and F2F (group d) acquired the lowest mean scores. No significant
   differences were found between research groups (b) and (c). MINT makes
   significant contributions to students' achievements in designing
   experiments and drawing conclusions. The novel use of metacognitive
   training within an ALN environment demonstrates the advantage of
   enhancing the effects of ALN on students' achievements in science.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; TEACHERS; SCIENCE
AB It is widely recognized that lectures continue to dominate college
   chemistry instruction, especially in developing countries, and that
   lectures limit student intellectual engagement. To address this
   concern, a General Chemistry course in a Philippine university was
   reconstructed to implement an instructional cycle consisting of three
   phases: a plenary or mini-lecture, seatwork activity, and a summary or
   closure. An expert instructor coached the instructors to improve their
   teaching. Two instructors were involved in pilot implementation and 13
   instructors in a large-scale implementation. This article describes the
   instructors' adoption of the instructional cycle using qualitative and
   quantitative methods that involved multiple data sources. The
   instructional cycle and intensive coaching enabled most instructors to
   change their practices, shift their focus from teaching to learning,
   and enhance their knowledge of student learning difficulties. Nine
   instructors were able to significantly change their teaching and apply
   meaningful student seatwork in their lessons. These nine instructors
   used student seatwork and activities 30-70% of the time, whereas
   previously 90% of the time involved lectures. Videotape records showed
   that more than 70% of the students were continuously on task. Four
   instructors had considerable difficulties in applying the new approach
   but also had difficulties with conventional lectures. The project
   constituted the start of a departmental reorientation with a focus on
   effectiveness of teaching and learning. Subsequently the faculty and
   course development model developed in this study was used to revise
   other courses. The theory of Rogan and Grayson proved useful in
   describing the change processes.

TI The dilemma of case-based teaching and learning in science in Hong
   Kong: Students need it, want it, but may not value it
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CHEMISTRY; MOTIVATION
AB The paper reports a study for determining a suitable process for
   converting traditional surface science courses into case-based learning
   ones in two universities in Hong Kong. In this preparative study, a set
   of baseline data was collected on the current level of students'
   conceptual understanding and also students' perceptions about the
   traditional courses. The student data (from 38 students) came from
   examination results, the Study Process Questionnaire, a course-end
   survey and a focus group meeting; teachers also kept reflective
   journals. This set of baseline data revealed factors that both support
   and inhibit case-based learning. On the one hand, students demonstrate
   a motivation to be able to solve practical problems in this field; on
   the other hand, they show an unwillingness to take up a personal
   responsibility for learning. This finding strengthens our resolve to
   take into account students' expectations and beliefs in the
   implementation of case-based teaching and learning.

AB In this study, the relationships among students' cognitive/motivational
   variables, cognitive conflict, and conceptual change were investigated.
   Subjects were 159 seventh graders in Korea. Tests regarding logical
   thinking ability, field dependence/independence (FDI), meaningful
   learning approach, failure tolerance, mastery goal orientation, and
   self-efficacy were administered to examine students'
   cognitive/motivational characteristics. A preconception test and a test
   of responses to discrepant event were also conducted to examine the
   degree of students' cognitive conflict induced by a discrepant event.
   Computer-assisted instruction, designed to change an undifferentiated
   weight-density concept into a scientific density concept, was then
   provided to students as a conceptual change intervention. A conception
   test was administered as a post-test. The results indicated that FDI
   was the only statistically significant variable correlated with the
   degree of cognitive conflict. A stepwise multiple regression analysis
   revealed that logical thinking ability, FDI, and failure tolerance were
   statistically significant predictors of the conception test scores.
   Educational implications are discussed.

AB In this descriptive study, the science subject matter knowledge of
   preservice and inservice elementary teachers was examined and compared.
   Over an eight-year period, answers to 13 science questions, including
   10 from the US National Science Foundation's Survey of Public Attitudes
   Toward and Understanding of Science and Technology, were collected from
   a total of 414 preservice and 67 inservice teachers during first-day
   discussions in elementary science methods courses. Both groups
   outperformed average citizens on the 10 survey questions. However,
   three other questions used to introduce discussion of why students may
   find learning science difficult revealed lack of conceptual
   understanding of basic physical and biological phenomena commonly found
   in most elementary science curricula. Results and implications are
   discussed in the context of increasing expectations for subject matter
   competence demanded of 'highly qualified teachers' under provisions of
   the 2001 US Elementary and Secondary Education Act ('No Child Left
   Behind Act').

AB This paper discusses the evaluation of an informal science education
   project, The Birdhouse Network (TBN) of the Cornell Laboratory of
   Ornithology. The Elaboration Likelihood Model and the theory of
   Experiential Education were used as frameworks to analyse the impact of
   TBN on participants' attitudes toward science and the environment, on
   their knowledge of bird biology, and on their understanding of the
   scientific process. The project had an impact on participants'
   knowledge of bird biology. No statistically significant change in
   participants' attitudes toward science or the environment, or in
   participants' understanding of the scientific process, could be
   detected. The results suggest that projects must make explicit to
   participants the issues that they are experiencing. In addition, the
   results suggest that more sensitive measures need to be designed to
   assess attitude change among environmentally aware citizens.

AB In Portugal, the number of students in higher education increased from
   80,000 in 1975 to 381,000 in 2000 ( a change from 11% to 53% in the age
   group 18-22), meaning a major change in the diversity of student
   population with consequences well known and studied in other countries.
   The teaching of chemistry at the University of Aveiro, for the
   first-year students of science and engineering, has been subjected to
   continuous attention to implement quality and student-centred
   approaches. The work devoted to excellence and deep learning by several
   authors has been carefully followed and considered. This communication
   reports research work on chemistry teaching, associated with those
   developments for first-year students. The work included the design of
   strategies and the adoption of teaching and learning activities
   exploring ways to stimulate active learning by improving the quality of
   classroom interactions. In addition to regular lectures, large classes'
   teaching based on student-generated questions was explored. In order to
   improve students' motivation and stimulate their curiosity,
   conference-lectures were adopted to deal with selected topics of wide
   scientific, technological and social interest. Quantitative analysis
   and discussion of selected case studies, together with the organization
   of laboratory classes based on selected enquiry-based experiments,
   planned and executed by students, stimulated deep learning processes. A
   sample of 32 students was followed in the academic year of 2000/01 and
   the results obtained are here discussed in comparison with those of a
   sample of 100 students followed in 2001/02. Particular attention was
   paid to the quality of classroom interactions, the use of questions by
   students and their views about the course design.

AB Compared to our ancestors, we live in an era of unprecedented change.
   This change brings with it opportunities both for success and for
   disaster. If individuals, organisations and nations are to court
   success and avoid disaster, it is imperative that we identify useful
   mechanisms that will enable us to amplify the possibility of one while
   nullifying the onset of the other. The fundamental tenet of this paper
   is that effective knowledge management within the context of ongoing
   educational processes can lead both to the successful development of
   'growth economies' and the creation of more stable societies based on
   the principle of dynamic knowledge sharing.

AB Twelve Australian and 12 Chinese heritage students from a third-year
   university computer ethics subject completed a Readiness for Online
   Learning Questionnaire; and six students from each of these two groups
   participated in a student-facilitated problem-solving discussion
   through computer-mediated communication. The questionnaire comparisons
   showed that the two groups of students were equally willing to
   self-manage their own learning, but that Australian students were
   significantly more comfortable with e-learning. The analysis of student
   postings in the CMC component showed that, collectively, Australian
   students posted more messages than did the Chinese students. Both
   groups participated equally in socialisation online; although Chinese
   heritage students posted a higher number of messages associated with
   organisational matters; and Australian students posted a larger number
   of message components associated with intellectual contributions to the
   discussion. These results are interpreted in a theoretical context and
   implications for practice are drawn.

   discussion of the importance of planning and the relevance of these
   issues for a campus-based institution. A five-pronged approach is
   described that involves: the use of a university-wide course management

AB A prototype virtual university server in Lebanon (VUSIL) has been
   designed and implemented. The server is to be used as a basis for the
   creation of a digital campus facility in Lebanon. An important aspect
   of the server has been its use as a tool for attempting to assess
   potential students' attitudes to this approach to learning. This paper
   briefly describes the VUSIL system and then reports on an evaluation
   study within the framework of the Technology Acceptance Model (Davis,
   1993). Levels of system acceptance of the VUSIL system were high and a
   range of subjects was identified that students would like to study
   using the system. Perceived usefulness was a mediator of the effect of
   perceived ease-of-use on intention-to-use VUSIL and the factor
   perceived ease of use was identified as a prerequisite for achieving
   high levels of system use, thereby confirming previous research.

AB Many researchers have found differences in the ways in which boys and
   girls use computers, but there has been no systematic investigation
   into what types of electronic textbook are good for girls and which are
   good for boys. This paper describes an experimental investigation in
   which 35 units from electronic textbooks on mathematics, history,
   chemistry, geography and the Estonian language were studied by 33 girls
   and 21 boys aged between 15 and 16 years of age. The correlation
   coefficients of the girls' and the boys' post-test scores (with the
   different characteristics of the electronic textbooks) are presented
   and discussed. The girls' results were associated more with the
   characteristics of navigation and design of information than the boys'
   results. There were also different characteristics of text and
   self-assessment associated with the girls' and boys' test scores. This
   paper explains the findings in terms of societal factors and the girls'
   lower level of computer skills. From the findings recommendations for
   composing electronic textbooks and attitude formation towards
   computer-aided learning can be recommended.

TI A model for synchronous learning using the Internet
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Improvements in technology and the increasing bandwidth of Internet
   access have led to an increasing popularity for synchronous solutions
   for instruction. Not only do they provide savings in terms of time and
   cost, in many situations they can also outperform both asynchronous
   online instruction and traditional face-to-face education. However,
   until now, the lack of a pedagogical framework for synchronous
   instruction has limited the effective use of this medium. This paper
   describes an online synchronous learning model that aims to provide
   guidelines for teachers and students to conduct synchronous
   instruction. The model provides a broad range of scenarios to suit
   individual requirements and covers both synchronous lecturing and
   'office-hours' modes.

AB This study explored how some college students understand the nature of
   the theory of evolution and how they evaluate its scientific status. We
   conducted semistructured interviews with 15 college biology seniors in
   which we asked them to explain why they think evolution assumes the
   status of a scientific theory, how it compares to other scientific
   theories, and what criteria do they use to determine if an explanation
   is scientific or not. Students' responses encompassed five themes that
   include evidence, certainty, experimentation, method of theory
   generation, and prediction. Those themes focused on the theory's
   empirical dimension which seemed to be derived from a generic and
   simplistic model of physical science theories that valued direct
   evidence. Demanding that evolutionary theory conform to this model
   reveals a misunderstanding of its nature. This misunderstanding was
   expressed in relation to aspects of methodology, explanation, and
   prediction. The findings underscore the need for using explicit
   discipline- and context-specific approaches to teaching and learning
   about scientific theories. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID EDUCATION; ACHIEVEMENT; STUDENTS; GAP
AB This paper reports on a 3-year study of a half-day urban magnet high
   school founded upon a desire to provide rigorous science, math, and
   technology experiences to students who would not otherwise have access
   to such educational opportunities. Using the theoretical lens of how a
   model of an educated person gets culturally produced within the school
   setting, I attended to: (1) the institutional construction of preferred
   student identity, (2) ways in which students in the school both took up
   and transformed this identity, and (3) how these student initiatives
   played a role in gradual institutional shifts in student expectations.
   Four constructs-learning, achievement, resistance, and success-were
   found to play significant roles in how the qualities of an educated
   person were negotiated through practice in attempts to create a culture
   of academic success in science and mathematics. These findings have
   implications for teaching and learning in other urban school settings.

TI Analysis of South African graduate degrees in science education:
   1930-2000
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This analysis of research conducted by graduate students at South
   African universities over the last 70 years is an attempt to identify
   the foci of South African science education research. Appropriate
   graduate degrees were systematically identified by interrogating
   electronic databases and verifying details. Title and abstract were
   then used to assign keywords. Overall 23% and 77% of the 469 graduate
   degrees identified are doctoral and master's degrees, respectively. The
   activity of graduate work suggests that science education as a
   discipline was comparatively well established in South Africa by the
   1980s, although 59% of all degrees were conferred between 1991 and
   2000. Following the methodology of White [2001, in V. Richardson (Ed.),
   Handbook of research on teaching (4th ed., pp. 457-471)]. Washington,
   DC: American Educational Research Association), trends in the relative
   frequency of keywords indicate that South African science education is
   broadly in line with worldwide trends in the discipline but that some
   differences exist. However, South African science education research
   appears to focus relatively more on attitudes, classrooms, curriculum
   issues, STS-related issues, and laboratories, and relatively less on
   assessment, reflection, teachers' or students' conceptions, and
   informal learning. Research on identified national priorities is being
   conducted, albeit with variable prevalence. Future opportunities in
   science education research lie in following a research agenda more
   closely matched to local contexts, and in the diversification of
   research focused largely on the secondary-tertiary interface. (c) 2005

AB Using the US national sample from the Third International Mathematics
   and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Rasch modeling method, this study
   identified the conceptual Progression sequence of various matter
   concept aspects, and compared students' latent abilities against the
   sequence. We found that the four matter aspects, i.e. conservation,
   physical properties and change, chemical properties and change, and
   structure and composition, are interrelated. Although they differ in
   overall difficulty with an increased difficulty from conservation to
   physical properties and change to chemical properties and change and to
   structure and composition, the difference among them is not
   statistically significant. at the 0.05 level. Elementary school
   students (3rd and 4th grades) have an average latent ability below the
   average difficulty of items oil the conservation aspect; 7th graders'
   average latent ability is above the average difficulty level of the
   conservation and physical properties and change aspects; 8th and 12th
   grade Students' average latent ability is above the average difficulty
   level of all the aspects except for structure and composition; and 12th
   grade science specialization students' average latent ability is above
   the average difficulty level of all the four aspects. We proposed a
   dynamic overlapping wave model of matter concept development to make
   sense the above-identified progression patterns. (c) 2005 Wiley

   period from 1978 to 2001
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Taking the Junior Secondary School Chemistry Curriculum (JSSCC) in the
   People's Republic of China as a case, this paper approaches the issue
   of the tension between elite and future citizenry orientations in
   science Curriculum. The changes in the JSSCC over the period from 1978
   to 2001 are explained from three viewpoints: sociopolitical,
   individual, and international influences. Based on the data collected
   from curriculum documents, and interviews with people involved in
   designing the JSSCC over the period under study, a model is established
   in terms of the tension between the two curriculum orientations. In
   this model, it is argued that the elite and future citizenry curriculum
   orientations are influenced by different forces. For the elite
   orientation, the forces are the "science for the minority" policy
   released by the nation, the subject matter centered input from the
   West, and a dominant role played by academic scientists. For the future
   citizenry orientation, the forces are the "science for the majority"
   policy released by the nation, the socially, personally, and culturally
   relevant input from the West, and an emerging dominant role played by
   science educators. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Secondary science methods students' thinking on coteaching practice was
   studied for the development of conscious elements of practical teacher
   knowledge supporting the use of structured inquiry. Reflective dialogue
   on practice in an electronic forum was analyzed for elements of formal
   learning and biography (past and present) that informed thinking on
   practice. Changes in thinking over time were considered in light of
   observed practice, including methods students' thinking about inquiry
   through use of STC curriculum. Three concepts related to experience in
   learning to teach in this model emerged from the data: (a) movement
   from cultural acclimation to reflection on inquiry practice, (b)
   thinking through past educational knowledge and experience, and (c)
   integrating knowledge and experience in practice. Discussion highlights
   the integration of formal knowledge, biography, and peripheral
   participation with development of "knowledge of students" in learning
   to teach in this model. Implications for preservice teacher education
   highlight the important aspects of learning to teach in practice in
   order to begin developing practical teacher knowledge for teaching
   using structured inquiry. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The purpose of this study was to develop a questionnaire that measures
   students' motivation toward science learning ( SMTSL). Six scales were
   developed: self- efficacy, active learning strategies, science learning
   value, performance goal, achievement goal, and learning environment
   stimulation. In total, 1407 junior high school students from central
   Taiwan, varying in grades, sex, and achievements, were selected by
   stratified random sampling to respond to the questionnaire. The
   Cronbach alpha for the entire questionnaire was 0.89; for each scale,
   alpha ranged from 0.70 to 0.89. There were significant correlations ( p
   < 0.01) of the SMTSL questionnaire with students' science attitudes ( r
   = 0.41), and with the science achievement test in previous and current
   semesters ( r(p) = 0.40 and r(c) = 0.41). High motivators and low
   motivators showed a significant difference ( p < 0.01) on their SMTSL
   scores. Findings of the study confirmed the validity and reliability of
   the SMTSL questionnaire. Implications for using the SMTSL questionnaire
   in research and in class are discussed in the paper.

AB This study investigated which plants and animals Swiss children found
   most attractive and evaluated the effect of an educational programme on
   children's preferences for species. More than 4000 pupils ( 8 - 16
   years old) from 248 classes participated in the study. Possible effects
   of the programme were studied with the help of questionnaires using a
   pretest/ post- test design with an experimental group that participated
   in the programme and a control group that did not. Before the start of
   the programme most children found decorative or garden species among
   plants, and pets and exotic species among animals, most attractive.
   However, the more wild plants and animals children noticed in their
   local environment and could name, the more did they appreciate these
   organisms. Moreover, the more additional wild plants the children
   noticed due to the programme, the higher was the increase in their
   appreciation of these species. This supports the hypothesis that
   children may appreciate animals other than pets and exotic species and
   even inconspicuous wild plants if they know them.

AB This study explores the impact of a cryogenics- based enrichment
   programme, which involves demonstrations that use liquid nitrogen, on
   attitudes towards science and the learning of science concepts. The
   findings presented in this paper are based on a sample of 214 fifth-
   grade students from two schools in Singapore who had their enrichment
   lesson in a subzero- temperature science centre. Overall, the students
   viewed science as more enjoyable and acquired more interest in wanting
   to pursue science careers after experiencing the cryogenics- based
   enrichment programme, but no remarkable and conclusive change was
   detected in their perceptions of the social implications of science.
   Significant knowledge gains were also detected among the participants.
   The programme did not have any differential impact on students of
   either gender and from two learning streams, both cognitively and
   affectively.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID COMPUTER-SIMULATIONS; CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; STUDENTS; CLASSROOM;
   TECHNOLOGY; PHYSICS; MOTION
AB This paper presents an analysis of how affordances of ICT- rich
   environments identified from a recent review of the research literature
   can support students in learning science in schools within a proposed
   framework for pedagogical practice in science education. Furthermore
   other pedagogical and curriculum innovations in science education (
   promoting cognitive change, formative assessment and lifelong learning)
   are examined to see how they may be supported and enhanced by
   affordances of ICT- rich environments. The affordances that I have
   identified support learning through four main effects: promoting
   cognitive acceleration; enabling a wider range of experience so that
   students can relate science to their own and other real- world
   experiences; increasing students' self- management; and facilitating
   data collection and presentation. ICT- rich environments already
   provide a range of affordances that have been shown to enable learning
   of science but integrating these affordances with other pedagogical
   innovations provides even greater potential for enhancement of
   students' learning.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MISCONCEPTIONS; PRECONCEPTIONS; INSTRUCTION; INTUITIONS
AB The qualitative study described in this paper examined the
   effectiveness of bridging analogies intended to bring about conceptual
   change as part of a constructivist approach to teaching about action -
   reaction forces in the ` at rest' condition in physics. Twenty- one 15-
   year- old students were involved in the investigation with subgroups
   previously exposed to different information regarding forces, weight
   and the accepted cause of the reaction force, in simple physical
   arrangements, including objects on tables. In- depth ` think aloud'
   interviews were used to track each student's conceptual status as they
   worked with bridging analogies and transcript coding was carried out
   using open and axial coding ( as in a grounded theory methodology). The
   findings showed that the bridging analogies were effective in engaging
   students with the idea of action - reaction forces; students were adept
   in mapping each of the analogies to the target concept and using them
   to generate and refine their causal theories for the reaction force.
   There was evidence to suggest that, for some students, bridging
   analogies were more effective in bringing about conceptual change than
   didactic teaching. Their use extends beyond illustrative purposes and
   supports the development of meta- cognitive skills.

AB This forum will initiate with a description of the implementation of a
   constructivist-based reform effort in k-12 classrooms in the US. The
   reform effort was an online collaboration among four teachers in 4(th)
   and 5(th) grades classrooms to implement a design problem-based unit
   meant to develop higher-order thinking responses in students. The unit
   design principles are correlated to current research in the cognitive
   sciences and the teachers' efforts at implementing reform are
   correlated to current research in theories of innovation. The initial
   description will also briefly characterize aspects of the
   implementation process that led to productive or less productive reform
   results. The questions that will be developed in this forum include:
   1. How can teachers' professional development programs to increase the
   effectiveness of innovation in education?
   2. Do students have a stake in educational reform including emerging
   technologies-specifically constructivist-based learning principles-, as
   in are these learning principles important and valid for students?
   3. How can educational systems encourage innovation in education?
   4. How can communities support efforts to change in education?
   5. Are reforms, such as the integration of advanced technologies within
   a constructivist-based learning environment meant to develop
   higher-order cognition valued in today's society?
   6. How can educational research aid efforts at change in education?

AB The main goal here is to introduce a new perspective through which
   cognitive learning theory plays an active role in instructional
   hypermedia design and evaluation through testing educational mediums
   that elicit two distinct levels of cognitive processing for materials
   of different levels of complexity. Results indicate that if the
   cognitive level required is high and the materials are more complex,
   then a retardation effect occurs to learning, while a lower cognitive
   level requirement achieves better results will all types of materials.
   This highlights the importance of taking cognitive requirements into
   consideration during the design of instructional hypermedia to produce
   "Cognitively Informed Systems". This perspective will allow a designer
   to analyze the same system from the perspective of how the presentation
   style and medium are likely to interact with students' cognitive
   processes during learning. This perspective is predicted to help lower
   the cognitive load demands of various instructional hypermedia systems
   in order to increase the educational impact of these systems and avoid
   any learning inhibitors to arise.

AB Computer games are very popular among children and adolescents. In this
   respect, they could be exploited by educational software designers to
   render educational software more attractive and motivating. However, it
   remains to be explored what the educational scope of educational
   software games is. In this paper, we explore several issues concerning
   the educational effectiveness, appeal and scope of educational software
   games through an evaluation study of an Intelligent Tutoring System (
   ITS) that operates as a virtual reality educational game. The results
   of the evaluation show that educational virtual reality games can be
   very motivating while retaining or even improving the educational
   effects on students. Moreover, one important finding of the study was
   that the educational effectiveness of the game was particularly high
   for students who used to have poor performance in the domain taught
   prior to their learning experience with the game.

DE process oriented learning designs; innovative teaching practices;

AB Process-oriented learning designs are innovative learning activities
   that include a set of inter-related learning tasks and are generic (
   could be used across disciplines). An example includes a
   problem-solving process widely used in problem-based learning today.
   Most of the existing process-oriented learning designs are not
   documented, let alone analysed, in any systematic way because they are
   tacit knowledge gained through years of experience and reflection.
   The paper investigates the problems of creation, sharing and IT support
   of process-oriented learning designs and proposes a new type of
   process-oriented, knowledge management educational technology called
   the web-based handbook of learning designs. It is envisaged that this
   technology will enable teachers to assemble, share, reuse and execute
   process-oriented learning designs without any programming involved. To
   design this technology, the paper proposes a multidisciplinary
   framework that integrates research in six different areas: educational
   theories, educational technologies, knowledge management, software
   engineering, process management and web-services. The paper then uses
   this multidisciplinary framework to identify the main research
   challenges that need to be solved before this technology can be adopted
   on a larger scale.

AB Teaching is becoming one of the most challenging professions in our
   society where knowledge is expanding rapidly and modern technologies
   are demanding teachers to learn how to use these technologies in their
   teaching. While new technologies increase teachers' training needs,
   they also offer part of the solution. Information and communication
   technology (ICT) can provide more flexible and effective ways for
   professional development for teachers, improve pre- and in-service
   teacher training, and connect teachers to the global teacher community.
   This paper analyses and organizes a variety of approaches found in ICT
   uses in teacher training into a four-cell matrix. Based on the analysis
   of those approaches, it discusses new possibilities and challenges that
   ICT has brought to teacher training and professional development. It
   concludes with discussion of emerging research issues with respect to
   ICT integration into teacher training and networking.

DE technology; postmodernism; teacher roles; teacher training
AB Entering graduate students were asked whether technology would soon
   eliminate the need for teachers. Responses ( all negative) were clearly
   separable into 'modernist' responses, which indicated that the role of
   education was the transmission of information and skills, but that
   teachers can do a better job of this; and 'postmodernist' responses,
   which indicated other roles for educators. Many incoming students
   displayed a lack of insight into the possibilities for technology in
   education. The study concludes that teachers should be made aware of
   the various goals of education, and which goals can best be achieved
   using technology. A second recommendation is that potential educators
   be made more aware of the various roles of technology in education, and
   how teacher-technology synergies can be tapped.

AB This study investigates student teachers' opinions about learning
   "instructional technology and material preparation" subjects in a

   study design was employed. The students of one classroom were the focus
   of an in-depth investigation by means of interviews, which were
   designed to elicit these students' perceptions concerning the use of
   hypermedia as a cognitive tool in the learning process. The study
   sample consisted of twenty-eight second-year students who enrolled in
   the Instructional Technology and Material Preparation Course in the
   Fall of 2001 at Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey. The
   study lasted fourteen weeks ( two hours per week). In the group, high,
   average, and low achievers ( based on their GPAs), and both males and
   females were represented. An interview schedule consisting of sixteen
   questions was designed to obtain the students' opinions about
   developing hypermedia as a cognitive tool to learn the subject. The
   data collected through the interviews were subjected to content
   analysis. The results indicate that the majority of the students
   preferred the hypermedia-based constructivist learning environment in
   the course to a traditional learning environment. The students thought
   that the hypermedia-based constructivist learning environment helped
   them learn the subject matter more effectively.

   System(LMS) as scheduling center of messages, thus the content
   components can not only be aggregated to compose higher-level units of

AB The purpose of this study was to assess the perceived effectiveness of
   the CourseInfo instructional technology package implemented at a
   regional Midwestern university. An online survey was administered, with
   971 students and 44 faculty responding. Results indicate attitudes of
   both faculty and students were positive - both believed that the web,
   and specifically Blackboard's CourseInfo, were beneficial educational
   tools. They felt confident in their ability to utilize both CourseInfo
   and the Web and considered themselves computer literate. Faculty,
   significantly more than students, believed both teacher-student and
   student-student communication was facilitated. Students, much more than
   faculty felt that CourseInfo had improved student learning.

AB Instructional planning is an essential professional activity often used
   by teachers. However, some characteristics of existing university-based
   teacher education programs may hamper pre-service teachers' learning of
   instructional planning. Thus, this study adopts the cognitive
   apprenticeship as a theoretical foundation to construct a web-based
   learning model that integrates expert teachers and Internet
   technologies ( web-based multimedia, performance support system, and
   electronic conferencing). To examine the effectiveness of this model, a
   seven-week web-based course was designed and a field experiment was
   conducted. Experimental results reveal that the course based on the
   web-based cognitive apprenticeship model improves pre-service teachers'
   performance and attitudes on instructional planning more effectively
   than the traditional training course. Furthermore, the study discusses
   possible factors based on qualitative data and provides recommendations
   for future studies and web-based teacher education instruction.

DT Article
DE computer-mediated communication; instant messaging (IM); interactive
   learning environments; multi-tasking; classroom discussion
AB Can "Information Age" learners effectively multi-task in the classroom?
   Can synchronous classroom activities be designed around conceptually
   related tasks, to encourage deeper processing and greater learning of
   classroom content? This research was undertaken to begin to address
   these questions. In this study, we explored the use of
   instructionally-related instant messaging (IM) discussions during
   undergraduate university lectures. Over the course of three weeks,
   students practiced with and then employed hand-held computers for
   brief, synchronous class discussions in response to assigned questions
   related to the lectures. Students were observed during these sessions,
   and students and the instructors were interviewed separately
   afterwards. The contents of students' discussions indicate that they
   were capable of engaging in on-task discussions and of expressing
   opinions and exploring instructionally relevant topics. However, even
   though students routinely multi-task in classrooms as they attend to
   lectures, process the contents, and record notes for later study, both
   students and the instructors expressed some discomfort with discussion
   occurring synchronously with classroom lectures. In this paper, we
   describe student discussion behavior, and reflect on possible
   applications of multiple sequential ( rather than simultaneous) tasks
   during classroom instruction.

TI Understanding teacher mindsets: IT and change in Hong Kong schools
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE teacher development; IT and teacher understandings and practices;
   change in schools
AB In 1998, the Hong Kong government introduced a new policy to use
   information technology ( IT) as a "catalyst" for change in classroom
   practices. The desired effect was to create a shift from a
   predominantly teacher-centred approach to more learner-centred
   teaching. This investigation explores the impact of IT on teaching
   practices in Hong Kong schools from the perspective of teachers,
   through the collection of data from surveys and reports into individual
   school practices, group discussions and follow-up individual
   interviews. The data was analysed using Fullan's 2001 framework for
   understanding leadership within a culture of change. This framework was
   chosen to facilitate a better understanding of the problems facing
   classroom teachers. The analysis revealed that while the teachers in
   this study had indeed taken up the challenge to use IT in their
   teaching, their practices were little changed. IT was used mainly to
   support the existing teacher-centred approach. This study identified
   that the lack of clear and systematic leadership support, the
   inflexibility of the curriculum and assessment processes, time
   constraints, and limited appropriate professional development were the
   main reasons for the restricted impact of IT on the teachers' practices
   in the classroom.

AB The focus of this study is to demonstrate and discuss the educational
   advantages of Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI). A quasi-experimental
   design compared learning outcomes of participants in an introductory
   statistics course that integrated CAI to participants in a Lecture-only
   introductory statistics course. Reviews of participants' identical
   midterm and final exams scores demonstrated that participants in
   Lecture-plus-CAI section obtained higher averages on midterm and final
   exams than participants in the Lecture-only sections and these higher
   averages likely were because of their better performance on concepts
   and practices that were taught in both regular lecture and CAI course.
   In addition, when the topics of the introductory statistics course
   moved from descriptive statistics to inferential statistics, the
   learning gap between Lecture-only and Lecture-plus-CAI is increased.
   Findings suggest participants' learning capacity of the introductory
   statistics could be improved successfully when CAI used as a supplement
   to regular lecture in teaching introductory statistics course.

AB The current investigation sought to understand the relationships
   between college student alienation, academic achievement, and use of
   WebCT. Fifty-three students enrolled in an undergraduate educational
   psychology course provided three types of data: 1) self-rating of eight
   Likert scale alienation items, 2) academic achievement measured with
   four types of multiple choice questions evaluating mastery of course
   content, and 3) use of WebCT defined as total number of Hits, Articles
   Posted, and Articles Read. Findings suggest that peer alienation was
   associated with increased WebCT use; learning alienation and course
   alienation were associated with low WebCT use. Learning alienation
   demonstrated an inverse relation to academic achievement. In most
   cases, significant predictive relationships between academic
   achievement and student use of WebCT were curvilinear.

AB This paper assesses university students' acquisition of simple and
   complex knowledge, in exploring whether the knowledge gap hypothesis
   (KGH) with its origins in community-based research into people's
   informal learning from mass media, provides insights into students'
   acquisition and retention of information. The KGH posits that attempts
   to equalise knowledge within a community by releasing new information
   into it often either has no such effect, or even worsens knowledge
   inequities. The present study set out to discover if members of a
   diverse student class, when presented with the same course-related
   information, both simple and complex, acquired knowledge at similar
   rates. After formal university education, those with less prior
   education acquired less knowledge from the same learning opportunities
   than those with more prior education at each survey point. Second,
   although entry education level led to different learning outcomes
   initially, those with less prior education did subsequently achieve the
   same level of knowledge as those with more prior education. The paper
   finally reflects on whether existing KGH claims, based on informal
   education through the media, apply in a formal education environment.

AB Constructivist Internet-based learning environments are advocated by
   contemporary educators, but few studies investigated students'
   preferences toward the environments for learning a specific school
   subject such as science. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to
   develop a questionnaire to explore students' preferences toward
   constructivist Internet-based science learning environments. The
   questionnaire included eight scales: ease of use, relevance, multiple
   sources, student negotiation, cognitive apprenticeship, reflective
   thinking, critical judgment and epistemological awareness. The
   questionnaire responses were gathered from 853 Taiwan high school
   students. Through factor analysis, these scales revealed highly
   satisfactory validity and reliability in assessing students'
   perceptions for Internet-based science learning environments. The
   students' responses also showed that they strongly preferred the
   Internet-based learning environments that could connect scientific
   knowledge with real life situations. Moreover, female students tended
   to place more emphasis on the instructional guidance offered by the
   Internet-based environments for science learning, as well as the
   presentation of scientific knowledge in authentic contexts than did
   male students. Future research and the implications for Internet-based
   instruction derived from this study were also discussed.

ID PEER ASSESSMENT; STUDENTS; FEEDBACK
AB This study reports the development and evaluation of a web-based
   interactive writing environment designed for elementary school
   students. The environment includes three writing themes, "story pass
   on", "story chameleon" and "thousand ideas", to encourage reading
   comprehension, creativity and problem-solving skills of students. Three
   assessment mechanisms, expert assessment, self-assessment and peer
   assessment, are also designed to provide constructive comments to
   foster students to review and criticize other writers' essay, to enable
   students to review their own essay to find strengths and weaknesses in
   writing, and to encourage students to improve their writing skills. The
   writing environment comprises four functional modules - writing,
   assessment, tool and system management. The system was integrated with
   multilayer educational services platforms, which are designed to
   support the establishment of online social learning communities for
   K-12 students and teachers. The system logs and assessment results have
   been analyzed through the system usage over two years. The results
   reveal that students can improve their writing skills by participating
   in the writing environment, submitting many essays, interacting with
   other students online and reviewing other essays. The comparison result
   of early and late student writing also demonstrates the improvement of
   writing. Analysis of the assessment mechanism reveals that expert
   assessment and peer assessment do not significantly differ. It appears
   that the assessment criteria proposed in this study fit the needs of
   both the expert and elementary school students. It is convinced this
   writing environment effectively helps students to write with designed
   social interaction, creative writing themes, and reflective assessment
   criteria.

AB The impact of summer science-enrichment programs on high-school
   students' science motivation and confidence was evaluated in a 7-month
   period following program completion. The programs took place on a
   college campus. The splashdown effect was defined as program-related
   changes the program graduates recognized in themselves that became
   apparent to them after reentry to their home high school. The effect
   was studied in a group of 88 gifted girls and boys from 38 high
   schools. On qualitative and quantitative measures obtained during
   private interviews, students reported a strong splashdown effect after
   returning to their high school. Results supported the validity of the
   splashdown concept. Splashdown motivation and splashdown confidence
   (i.e., recognition of program-related gains in motivation and
   confidence that occurred after high-school reentry) predicted change in
   corresponding science attitudes during the follow-up period. As
   predicted by social comparison theory, the intensity of the splashdown
   effect was associated with average school achievement in the student's
   home high school. Students from academically weaker schools reported
   stronger splashdown effects. Implications for enhancing and evaluating
   the effect of science-enrichment programs on students' science
   attitudes are discussed. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID ACHIEVEMENT; FAMILIES; REFORM; PARENT; GAP
AB This study investigated the effects of one rural high school's science
   course placement practices on Latino/a student success in science, as
   measured by performance in a required science course and enrollment in
   subsequent science courses. The high school involved in this study has
   experienced a rapid increase in language minority students and placed
   students considered to be "limited English proficient" into a science
   course intended for those with learning disabilities. The results
   indicate that track placement was inappropriate. as Latino/a students
   with demonstrated success on standardized tests written in English, and
   with high grade point averages, were placed in the lower-level science
   course. Students placed in the lower-level science course, regardless
   of academic ability, were unlikely to take subsequent courses required
   for college admission despite the fact that most had college
   aspirations. Conversely, low-achieving non-Latino/a White students were
   disproportionately placed in upper-level science classes, a track
   associated with greater success in science for all. Thus, despite this
   rural school's attempt to provide for the needs of all the students,
   the result in this case was decreased success in science for Latino/a
   students, regardless of their English fluency. Implications for
   inclusive rural science education are discussed. (c) 2005 Wiley

AB Learning using primary literature may be a way of developing a capacity
   for scientific ways of thinking among students. Since reading research
   articles is a difficult task for novices, we examined the possible
   benefits of learning using primary literature versus secondary
   literature, particularly with respect to their influence on the
   creation and formation of scientific literacy. We report on a
   comparison between four groups of high school students. each with
   differing degrees of prior knowledge in biology, who read a
   domain-related text written in either the scientific research article
   genre (adapted primary literature) or the popular-scientific genre
   (secondary literature). Although there was no significant difference in
   the students' ability to summarize the main ideas of each text,
   indicating that there was no eminent distinction in their content, we
   found that students who read adapted primary literature demonstrated
   better inquiry skills, whereas secondary literature readers
   comprehended the text better and demonstrated less negative attitudes
   toward the reading task. Since the scientific content of the two texts
   was essentially identical, we suggest that the differences in students'
   performances stem from the structure of the text, dictated by its
   genre. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Promoting fourth graders' conceptual change of their understanding of

SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING

ID THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK; SCIENCE; REPRESENTATIONS; CONSTRUCTION;
   CLASSROOM; PHYSICS; MODELS; VIEW
AB For the past two decades, a growing amount of research has shown that
   the use of analogies in science teaching and learning promotes
   meaningful understanding of complex scientific concepts (Gentner, 1983;
   Glynn, 1989; Harrison & Treagust, 1993; Wong, 1993). This article
   presents a study in which multiple analogies were used as scaffolding
   to link students' prior understanding of daily life events to knowledge
   of the scientific domain. The study was designed to investigate how
   multiple analogies influence student learning of a complex scientific
   concept: the electric circuit. We used several analogies in a set of
   learning materials to present the concepts of parallel and series
   circuits. Thirty-two fourth graders participated in this study and were
   randomly assigned to four groups. The four groups were named nonanalogy
   (control), single analogy, similar analogies, and complementary
   analogies, according to the materials they used in this study. The
   results demonstrated that using analogies not only promoted profound
   understanding of complex scientific concepts (such as electricity), but
   it also helped students overcome their misconceptions of these
   concepts. In particular, we found that the reason the students had
   difficulty understanding the concept of electricity was because of
   their ontological presupposition of the concept. Implications for
   teaching and learning are discussed. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID SCIENCE; PERSPECTIVES; PROGRAMS
AB This article explores the beliefs and practices of a high school
   biology teacher through three interrelated theoretical frameworks:
   common knowledge, collaborative teaming, and communities of practice.
   The data were obtained from an in-depth case study of Maria, a biology
   teacher from a Mexican public high school that was participating in a
   4-year international science project using collaborative learning and
   information and communication technology. Her beliefs and practices
   were explored by means of questionnaires, semi-structured interviews,
   and nonparticipant observation of classes. Through the use of the
   three-component framework, the degrees of coherence between practice
   and beliefs that guide the teacher's daily behavior became apparent, as
   well as the difficulties of incorporating innovations due to
   institutional constraints. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID TEACHERS; SCIENCE
AB The aim of this study was to develop a model of students' energy
   concept development. Applying Case's (1985, 1992) structural theory of
   cognitive development, we hypothesized that students' concept of energy
   undergoes a series of transitions, corresponding to systematic
   increases in working memory capacity. The US national sample from the
   Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) database was
   used to test our hypothesis. Items relevant to the energy concept in
   the TIMSS test booklets for three populations were identified. Item
   difficulty from Rasch modeling was used to test the hypothesized
   developmental sequence, and percentage of students' correct responses
   was used to test the correspondence between students' age/grade level
   and level of the energy concepts. The analysis supported our
   hypothesized sequence of energy concept development and suggested mixed
   effects of maturation and schooling on energy concept development.
   Further, the results suggest that curriculum and instruction design
   take into consideration the developmental progression of students'
   concept of energy. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The current study deals with the development of system thinking skills
   at the junior high school level. The sample population included about
   50 eighth-grade students from two different classes of an urban Israeli
   junior high school who studied an earth systems-based curriculum that
   focused on the hydro cycle. The study addressed the following research
   questions: (a) Could the students deal with complex systems?; (b) What
   has influenced the students' ability to deal with system perception?;
   and (c) What are the relationship among the cognitive components of
   system thinking? The research combined qualitative and quantitative
   methods and involved various research tools, which were implemented in
   order to collect the data concerning the students' knowledge and
   understanding before, during, and following the learning process. The
   findings indicated that the development of system thinking in the
   context of the earth systems consists of several sequential stages
   arranged in a hierarchical structure. The cognitive skills that are
   developed in each stage serve as the basis for the development of the
   next higher-order thinking skills. The research showed that in spite of
   the minimal initial system thinking abilities of the students most of
   them made some meaningful progress in their system thinking skills, and
   a third of them reached the highest level of system thinking in the
   context of the hydro cycle. Two main factors were found to be the
   source of the differential progress of the students: (a) the students'
   individual cognitive abilities, and (b) their level of involvement in
   the knowledge integration activities during their inquiry-based
   learning both indoors and outdoors. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID INVISIBLE PARTICLES; MENTAL MODELS; COHERENCE; PHYSICS; ORIGIN; EARTH
AB The objective of this study was to examine middle school students'
   developing understanding of the nature of matter and to compare middle
   school students' ideas to those of elementary schools students, as was
   done by Nakhleh and Samarapungavan [J Res Sci Teach 36(7):777-805,
   1999]. Nine middle school students were interviewed using a scripted,
   semistructured interview. The interview probed students' understanding
   of the composition and particulate (atomic/molecular) structure of a
   variety of material substances; the relationship between particulate
   structure and macroscopic properties such as fluidity and malleability;
   as well as understanding of processes such as phase transition and
   dissolving. The results indicate that most of the middle school
   students interviewed knew that matter was composed of atoms and
   molecules and some of them were able to use this knowledge to explain
   some processes such as phase transitions of water. In contrast, almost
   no elementary students knew that matter was composed of atoms and
   molecules. However, the middle school students were unable to
   consistently explain material properties or processes based on their
   knowledge of material composition. In contrast to elementary school
   students, who had scientifically inaccurate but relatively consistent
   (macrocontinuous or macroparticulate) knowledge frameworks, the middle
   school students could not be classified as having consistent knowledge
   frameworks because their ideas were very fragmented. The fragmentation
   of middle school students' ideas about matter probably reflects the
   difficulty of assimilating the microscopic level scientific knowledge
   acquired through formal instruction into students' initial macroscopic
   knowledge frameworks. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

DE collaboration; common ground; CSCL; distributed cognition; group meaning
AB Recent research on instructional technology has focused increasingly on
   the potential of computer support to promote collaborative learning.
   Socio-cultural theories have been imported from cognate fields to
   suggest that cognition and learning take place at the level of groups
   and communities as well as individuals. Various positions on this issue
   have been proposed and a number of theoretical perspectives have been
   recommended. In particular, the concept of common ground has been
   developed to explain how meanings and understandings can be shared by
   multiple individuals. This paper takes a critical look at the concept
   of shared meaning as it is generally used and proposes an empirical
   study of how group cognition is constituted in practice.

AB This article reviews the literature concerning the introduction of
   interactive whiteboards (IWBs) in educational settings. It identifies
   common themes to emerge from a burgeoning and diverse literature, which
   includes reports and summaries available on the Internet. Although the
   literature reviewed is overwhelmingly positive about the impact and the
   potential of IWBs, it is primarily based on the views of teachers and
   pupils. There is insufficient evidence to identify the actual impact of
   such technologies upon learning either in terms of classroom
   interaction or upon attainment and achievement. This article examines
   this issue in light of varying conceptions of interactivity and
   research into the effects of learning with verbal and visual

AB Students involved in the interactive whiteboard (IWB) evaluation,
   sponsored by the Centre for British Teachers (CfBT), were interviewed
   in regard to their perceptions about IWBs. Twelve group interviews (72
   students) were conducted between January and Easter 2004 with Year 6
   students (between 10 and 11 years of age) in six Local Education
   Authority (LEA) areas located in the North and South of England.
   Students were very enthusiastic about particular aspects of IWBs, such
   as their versatility in the classroom, multimedia capabilities and the
   fun and enjoyment they brought to learning. Students also highlighted,
   however, technical problems, teacher and students' information and
   communication technology skills and students' lack of access to the
   technology as negative aspects.

AB This article explores student teachers' views of the use of information
   and communication technologies (ICT) in schools. There is limited
   research literature regarding the perceptions that such students
   develop in relation to the use of ICT in teaching while observing
   practice in schools. The paper offers an interpretive analysis of the
   opinions that a cohort of undergraduate student teachers at a Scottish
   University expressed in an online forum, following a period of school
   placement. As part of their initial teacher education (ITE), the
   students were asked to post messages on the forum in relation to the
   factors that they perceived as promoting or hindering the use of ICT in
   schools. Perceptions that students held were found to be complex and
   varied. Students associated the use of ICT with changes in the nature
   of classroom relations, as well as a reshaping of learning and
   teaching. While they welcomed the introduction of ICT as a tool for
   modernising teaching, students identified a variety of factors that
   hinder this process. The paper finishes by identifying some of the
   implications for those working with student teachers in encouraging
   their development of reflective practice with ICT and enhancing their
   positive attitudes in relation to the use of ICT in schools.

ID COLLISIONS
AB We describe an iteratively designed sequence of activities involving
   the modelling of one-dimensional collisions between moving objects
   based on programming in ToonTalk. Students aged 13-14 years in two
   settings (London and Cyprus) investigated a number of collision
   situations, classified into six classes based on the relative
   velocities and masses of the colliding objects. We describe iterations
   of the system in which students engaged in a repeating cycle of
   activity for each collision class: prediction of object behaviour from
   given collision conditions, observation of a relevant video clip,
   building a model to represent the phenomena, testing, validating and
   refining their model, and publishing it - together with comments - on
   our web-based collaboration system, WebReports. Students were
   encouraged to consider the limitations of their current model, with the
   aim that they would eventually appreciate the benefit of constructing a
   general model that would work for all collision classes, rather than a
   different model for each class. We describe how our intention to engage
   students with the underlying concepts of conservation, closed systems
   and system states was instantiated in the activity design, and how the
   modelling activities afforded an alternative representational framework
   to traditional algebraic description.

AB Among the sciences, the practice of geology is especially visual. To
   assess the role of spatial ability in learning geology, we designed an
   experiment using: ( 1) web-based versions of spatial visualization
   tests, ( 2) a geospatial test, and ( 3) multimedia instructional
   modules built around QuickTime Virtual Reality movies. Students in
   control and experimental sections were administered measures of spatial
   orientation and visualization, as well as a content-based geospatial
   examination. All subjects improved significantly in their scores on
   spatial visualization and the geospatial examination. There was no
   change in their scores on spatial orientation. A three-way analysis of
   variance, with the geospatial examination as the dependent variable,
   revealed significant main effects favoring the experimental group and a
   significant interaction between treatment and gender. These results
   demonstrate that spatial ability can be improved through instruction,
   that learning of geological content will improve as a result, and that
   differences in performance between the genders can be eliminated.

AB The phenomena and procedures of science and technology are visual,
   analogical and thematic. Based on these characteristics, the visual
   core of science can be described in terms of 'master images' in the
   content of science, and 'visual processes' in the practice of science.
   The resulting synoptic lists provide a basis for designing
   instructional and communication materials.

ID EDUCATION; CONTEXT; REFORM
AB Models play an important role in science education. However, previous
   research has revealed that science teachers' content knowledge,
   curricular knowledge, and pedagogical content knowledge about models
   and modelling are often incomplete or inadequate. A research project
   was conducted that aimed at promoting and gaining an understanding of
   the development of beginning science teachers' knowledge in this area.
   The teachers, who were enrolled in a teacher's training programme,
   participated in a special course on models and modelling, and conducted
   a research project in their classes about this theme. The data gathered
   in this project support the discussion to the extent that both the
   activities of the course and the conducting of and reflection on their
   research projects contributed to the development of teachers'
   knowledge. From the results, we propose some guidelines for educational
   researchers interested in this area.

ID TEACHERS; BELIEFS; CLASSROOM; SCHOOL; VIEWS
AB The aims of this research were to validate the Cultural Learning
   Environment Questionnaire in the Brunei context and to evaluate
   culturally sensitive factors ( gender equity, collaboration, deference,
   competition, teacher authority, modelling and congruence) of upper
   secondary students' learning environment. The subjects of this study
   were 831 upper secondary science students from coeducational schools in
   Brunei. The data were collected by administering the Cultural Learning
   Environment Instrument developed by Fisher and Waldrip. Factor analysis
   and reliability results showed that the instrument was suitable for
   evaluating the six culturally sensitive factors associated with the
   cultural learning environment of Bruneian upper secondary students. The
   results also suggested that students believed both genders were treated
   equally in their classes. The students viewed that they were to some
   extent dependent learners; however, they were willing to give their
   independent views in their classes. The data also suggest that students
   perceived that they were equally cooperative and competitive. The
   culturally sensitive factors of the students' cultural learning
   environment were not influenced by their gender, but regional
   variations in values for some of these factors were observed. Further
   research has been recommended to investigate how the students were
   equally cooperative and competitive, as well as what factors
   contributed to the regional differences.

AB This study describes the processes involved in the development and
   statistical validation of a primary science curriculum delivery
   evaluation instrument, the Science Curriculum Implementation
   Questionnaire (SCIQ), used to identify factors influencing science
   programme delivery at the classroom and school level. The study begins
   by exploring the themes generated from several qualitative studies in
   the New Zealand context pertaining to the phenomenon of primary science
   delivery. Building on the findings from the qualitative studies,
   quantitative procedures used to develop and validate both a five-scale,
   35-item SCIQ and a seven-scale, 49-item SCIQ are presented. Finally,
   current applications of the seven-scale, 49-item SCIQ as a foundation
   for data collection, staff discussion and collaborative decision-making
   for the purpose of primary science delivery are briefly discussed.

AB Students' abilities to master the genres of science must include not
   only factual knowledge. They also have to negotiate what they want to
   achieve with their texts and their ideas about writing and themselves
   as writers and science students. In this article, classroom
   observations, text analysis and interviews are combined in a case study
   of two students' experimental reports in order to investigate the
   relationships between identity, action and meaning-making. The students
   show important differences in their relations to school science and
   teacher expectations in terms of familiarity with the experimental
   report genre and identity. Being able to interpret and discuss with
   students what they are 'up to' in their texts is important for teachers
   in order to improve students' reflections on their writing practices as
   well as in order to make norms and assumptions underlying teaching
   practices explicit. This will help students to negotiate and request
   meaningful relations to science.

ID INSTRUCTION; OUTCOMES
AB In the past several years, curriculum reform has received increasing
   attention from educators in many countries around the world. Recently,
   Taiwan has developed new Science and Life Technology Curriculum
   Standards (SaLTS) for grades 1 - 9. SaLTS features a systematic way for
   developing students' understanding and appreciation of individual -
   society - nature interactions, which are well aligned with the
   philosophical essence and foundations of Earth Systems Education (ESE).
   Implementation of several ESE-inspired curricula or instructional
   modules in the secondary schools of Taiwan have all demonstrated
   promise in improving students' abilities both in their cognitive and
   affective domains. Moreover, several empirical studies suggest that
   implementing the Earth-system integrated theme has the potential to
   serve as a model for future development of an integrated science

AB In this study, we examined the use of cognitive tools provided in a
   problem-based hypermedia learning environment for sixth graders.
   Purposes were to understand how the built-in tools were used, and tool
   use was associated with different problem-solving stages. Results
   showed that tools supporting cognitive processing and sharing cognitive
   load played a more central role early in the problem-solving process,
   whereas tools supporting cognitive activities that would be out of
   students' reach otherwise, and hypothesis generation and testing were
   used more in the later stages of problem-solving. The findings also
   indicated that students increasingly used multiple tools in the later
   stages of their problem-solving process. The various tools, performing
   different functions, appeared to enable students to coordinate multiple
   cognitive skills in a seamless way and, therefore, facilitated their
   information processing. Results also suggested that students with
   higher performance scores made more productive use of tools than
   students with lower performance scores. Findings of the study are
   discussed.

TI Does spatial or visual. information in maps facilitate text recall?
   Reconsidering the conjoint retention hypothesis
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID WORKING-MEMORY; DISCOURSE; PROSE
AB The conjoint retention hypothesis (CRH) claims that students recall
   more text information when they study geographic maps in addition to
   text than when they study text alone, because the maps are encoded
   spatially (Kulhavy, Lee, & Caterino, 1985). This claim was recently
   challenged by Griffin and Robinson (2000), who found no advantage for
   maps over feature lists in facilitating text recall. In two
   experiments, we crossed maps and lists with icons and names (cf,
   Griffin & Robinson), and employed materials and methodology very
   similar to those used in previous CRH studies by Kulhavy and colleagues
   (Kulhavy, Stock, Verdi, Rittschof, and Savenye, 1993; Stock, Kulhavy,
   Peterson, Hancock, & Verdi, 1995). In addition, we included a
   concurrent task to measure spatial encoding, as did Griffin and
   Robinson. No advantages were found for maps over lists in facilitating
   text recall, nor were maps processed in a more spatial manner than
   lists. Instead, it appears that the key stimulus . feature for
   facilitating text recall is mimetic icons (i.e., icons that represent
   features) rather than the spatial characteristics of geographic maps, a
   finding that supports dual-coding theory (Paivio, 1986), but not the
   CRH.

AB Learning sciences (LS) and instructional systems design (ISD) are two
   related fields that have shared interests in the application of
   technology for advancing human learning. While the two fields may have
   different values, boundaries, and in some cases methods, they also
   share significant overlap of content and purpose. We examine the
   relationship between the two fields through a citation analysis of
   three journals in each of the respective fields. The findings of the
   study indicate that the amount of cross-field publication is low, but
   there exists a trend for increased cross-field citation. As cross-field
   publication increases, we suggest that the existence of invisible
   colleges that link the fields will become more salient.

AB This article reports a case study describing how the principles of a
   cognitive apprenticeship (CA) model developed by Collins, Brown, and
   Holum (1991) were applied to a graduate course on performance systems
   analysis (PSA), and the dfferences this application made in student
   performance and evaluation of the course compared to the previous
   semester. I analyzed the requirements for the CA learning environment
   and identified the contributions of instructor, students, and the
   course based on those requirements. I then applied the findings to
   create an authentic learning environment based on CA principles. In
   this case the students became performance consultants, immersed in
   practical application of the PSA content and methodology to authentic
   organizational performance issues provided by real clients. Finally, I
   compare student evaluations of the course to student evaluations in the
   previous semester, and report their responses to a set of open-ended
   questions concerning the application of CA principles.

AB Problem-based learning (PBL) is apprenticeship for real-life problem
   solving, helping students acquire the knowledge and skills required in
   the workplace. Although the acquisition of knowledge and skills makes
   it possible for performance to occur, without self-efficacy the
   performance may not even be attempted. I examined how student
   self-efficacy, as it relates to being software development
   professionals, changed while involved in a PBL environment. Thirty-one
   undergraduate university computer science students completed a 16-week
   capstone course in software engineering during their final semester
   prior to graduation. Specific instructional strategies used in
   PBL-namely the use of authentic problems of practice, collaboration,
   and reflection-are presented as the catalyst for students' improved
   self-efficacy. Using a self-efficacy scale as pre- and postmeasures,
   and guided journal entries as process data, students were observed to
   increase their levels of self-sufficiency.

AB This article describes the Quest Atlantis (QA) project, a learning and
   teaching project that employs a multiuser, virtual environment to
   immerse children, ages 9-12, in educational tasks. QA combines
   strategies used in commercial gaming environments with lessons from
   educational research on learning and motivation. It allows users at
   participating elementary schools and after-school centers to travel
   through virtual spaces to perform, educational activities, talk with
   other users and mentors, and build virtual personae. Our work has
   involved an agenda and process that may be called socially-responsive
   design, which involves building sociotechnical structures that engage
   with and potentially transform individuals and their contexts of
   participation. This work sits at the intersection of education,
   entertainment, and social commitment and suggests an expansive focus
   for instructional designers. The focus is on engaging classroom culture
   and relevant aspects of student life to inspire participation
   consistent with social commitments and educational goals interpreted
   locally.

AB Computer-based systems have great potential for delivering learning
   material. Here, a Web-based learning management system is employed by a
   medical university to support undergraduate courses. The objective was
   to help the university's staff to understand the readiness and
   attitudes of students to the use of information technology, their
   orientation to new learning environments, and the functionality of the
   system. The participants were a cohort of first-year medical students
   enrolled in an introductory microbiology course. Students' attitudes to
   information technology and learning styles were measured by a
   rearranged questionnaire, and a principal component analysis identified
   the students' orientations to information technology and the learning
   environment. The results of the study revealed that students showed
   readiness to and positive attitudes towards information technology in
   education and exposed a possible benefit from its use in the long run.
   However, they also conveyed negative opinions of the learning
   management system used in their coursework, suggesting a need for
   change of the technology. This study provides evidence that in order
   for computer-based system to be effective they must be designed and
   implemented with care, otherwise they may risk to lower students'
   interests and activation. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   old) of junior school, it has been found that the upon completion of
   the PFSPA activities, the students demonstrate greater objectivity in
   their self-assessment scores; it has also been shown that significant
   consistency is found between the students' self- and peer-assessments
   results and that the assessment results of teachers. Furthermore, the

AB In response to the impact of information and communication technology
   on traditional business and commerce practices, and the empowerment of
   individuals by the growth of information available on the Internet,
   educators are challenged to adapt the curricula and delivery modes of
   educational programs for knowledge workers, such as tax accountants.
   Today's tax accountants are expected to be computer and information
   literate, and are valued for their critical thinking skills based on
   subject knowledge. This article evaluates the implementation of an
   e-learning Masters Program in Taxation in South Africa based on the
   feedback from students. Three criteria are used: the use of technology,
   the learning design, and flexibility of the tax program. Students
   reacted positively to the use of technology, but expressed concern
   about the lack of interaction between students, and between students
   and teachers. The author argues that the choice of technologies, the
   outsourcing of teaching services, and the program facilitator's
   teaching approach emulate the face-to-face tax program and therefore
   still support a teacher-centered teaching and learning approach.
   Students and teachers who are used to a traditional teacher-centered
   teaching and learning approach often measure the quality of a learning
   experience by the amount of information transmitted by a subject
   expert. Getting students to take responsibility for their own learning
   poses a bigger challenge than improving students' computer and
   information skills. Several recommendations are made to improve
   e-learning programs that will produce self-directed, lifelong learners
   who can be productive in an information-based economy. (c) 2004

AB This research explored learning and thinking processes enhanced by
   integrating computers in secondary schools electronics projects.
   Electronics studies provide a sophisticated learning environment, where
   computers are simultaneously part of the subject matter learned
   (Technology Education), and a means for enhancing teaching and learning
   (Educational Technology), as seen in any other area of education. The
   follow-up on fifty students working on their final projects showed that
   students working on computer-based electronics projects tend to adopt
   flexible strategies, such as creating new ideas, risk-taking,
   improvisation, using trial and error methods for problem solving, and
   rapid transition from one design to another. In contrast, students
   working on non-computerized electronics projects are more likely to
   progress along a linear path: planning, construction, and
   troubleshooting. Computerized projects also promote the transfer of
   knowledge between students, and joint development of ideas. Students
   who exercise freedom in their project do not express the same
   independence in their documentation, and prepare portfolios that show
   how they, supposedly, developed their system in an orderly manner. It
   is important to educate students, and teachers, that creative design

AB The aim of this research is to devise a cognitive tool for meeting the
   diverse needs of learners for comprehending new procedural knowledge. A
   model of affordances on teaching fraction equivalence for developing
   procedural knowledge for adding/subtracting fractions with unlike
   denominators was derived from the results of a case study of an initial
   prototype of a graphical partitioning model. Offering affordances in
   our model makes available profitable spaces for learners to interact in
   ways that meet their needs. This model of affordances was evaluated by
   a pre-test-post-test control group design to study the performance of
   the experimental group in learning with the model. Results of the study
   indicated that the model afforded learners, with various abilities for
   learning, knowledge of fraction equivalence. The key for mediating the
   generation of procedural knowledge for adding/subtracting fractions
   with unlike denominators in working with our cognitive tool was the
   concept of fraction equivalence and the capability of computing this.

ID JOURNAL RANKINGS; RESEARCH QUALITY; MANAGEMENT; DECISION
AB Interdisciplinary research is being promoted in many quarters as the
   way forward, but "research islands" still persist. Taking
   computer-assisted learning (CAL) within health sciences as a case in
   point, this paper describes a detailed study of the references to
   source material within papers published in general medical, specific
   nursing and general information and communications technology journals
   as pointing to papers published either in the same category of journal
   or journals of other categories. The results show that research within
   this area exhibits a disquieting inbred approach. Furthermore, there is
   clear evidence of a tendency amongst the papers examined to cite
   research published in journals with broadly the same impact factors as
   the journal in which the papers themselves are published. A discussion
   of the value of journal impact factors, which are a crude but useful
   index of the quality of journal, and their possible effect on the
   future of research in CAL within health sciences is embedded in the
   paper.

TI A knowledge management technology architecture for educational research
   organisations: Scaffolding research projects and workflow processing
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB There is growing recognition that the economic climate of the world is
   shifting towards a knowledge-based economy where knowledge will be
   cherished as the most prized asset. In this regard, technology can be
   leveraged as a useful tool in effectually managing the knowledge
   capital of an organisation. Although several research studies have
   advanced knowledge management frameworks catering to the requirements
   of organisations specialising in diverse fields of expertise, no
   comprehensive knowledge-management architecture has been found that is
   technology mediated and orientated towards the emergent needs of an
   educational research organisation. In this paper, we review a knowledge
   management technology approach modeled as a web portal that was
   developed to create a repository and to facilitate shared resources in
   a research organisation. This technology-based framework encapsulates
   the knowledge management processes that capture and augment the
   explicit knowledge resources of the research organisation. The
   framework also supports social networks that enable the sharing and
   encoding of tacit knowledge by facilitating online exchanges and
   feedback.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
AB The potential of videoconferencing to enrich distance learning needs to
   be widely recognised as well as the technology embedded in curriculum
   delivery and in distance learning programmes. The argument is supported
   by reference to a wide range of case studies from the author's
   experiences over a period of six years as International Officer with
   the Western Education and Library Board in Northern Ireland, and to
   exemplars of good practice from other sources in different parts of the
   world. As videoconferencing becomes more widely available in schools
   and in public libraries, it is important that there is a new awareness
   of its vast potential in order to ensure that this technology is fully
   exploited for the benefit of learning communities.

AB This study examined users' views about the usability of digital
   libraries current and perceived importance. Age, gender, prior
   experience with the Internet, college status, and digital library
   proficiency are the independent variables. Users' current views about
   the usability of digital libraries and users' perceived importance of
   digital library usability are treated as dependent variables. The
   Digital Library Usability Survey, a Likert-type instrument developed by
   Koohang, was used. The study's participants were 107 undergraduate
   students enrolled in an interdisciplinary and cross-functional degree
   programme at a large state university in the Midwest, USA. The
   collected data were analysed through statistical procedures. The
   overall results yielded significant differences for the variables of
   users' prior experience with the Internet and users' proficiency level
   with the digital library. The univariate results indicated a
   significant difference on the users' perceived importance of digital
   library usability. However, digital library proficiency produced a
   significant difference on users' current views about the digital
   library's usability. These results are discussed. Recommendations are
   made for practice and future research.

AB This article analyses data from over 1000 student questionnaires
   dealing with how students currently use the web to support their

   of the web and the overwhelming perception that the web now forms an
   integral part of their study and research practices. However, these
   practices require greater definition and refinement for and by the
   student. Evidence from some teaching staff is compared with that from
   students for validation purposes and has also revealed striking
   differences in perception and attitudes between the two groups. We
   identify specific needs on the part of most students in our survey who
   require greater guidance and study skills when using the web. These
   "Netskills" are described and recommendations are made concerning their
   acquisition and future development by students who are demanding that
   such skills become part of their own learning strategies.

DT Article
AB Online three-dimensional (3D) virtual worlds are emerging technologies
   that offer unique learning opportunities for traditional and
   distributed education. One of the more popular 3D virtual worlds,
   Active Worlds, is currently being used as a medium for synchronous and
   asynchronous distance learning. This investigation presents two
   exploratory case studies of different, but exemplary educational
   activities using Active Worlds for formal and informal education. The
   focus of each case study is to investigate how Active Worlds is being
   used for distance learning and to determine the type of learning
   experiences afforded by this 3D virtual environment. Whilst more
   research is necessary to explore fully the potential of 3D virtual
   worlds for learning, this initial investigation illustrates how Active
   Worlds affords opportunities for experiential learning and situated
   learning within a collaboration learning environment.

TI Managing content in e-learning environments
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of e-learning environments to support teaching and learning has
   had great impact on the way content is developed and managed. In most
   cases, both teachers and students have had to re-adapt the way they
   prepare, access and engage with educational matter. The adjustment in
   human mechanisms for organising and interacting with educational
   content has become necessary due to the re-mediation of established
   practices through the introduction of software-based techniques to
   structure content, for example, using metadata. Whilst metadata
   standards provide effective guidelines for organising content in
   web-based e-learning environments, technology-based approaches to
   managing educational resources do not fully address social-cultural and
   pedagogical aspects of users in the context in which teaching and
   learning takes place. In this regard, the effectiveness of using
   metadata to structure the discovery and access to educational content
   should be considered in relation to the extent by which metadata
   descriptors are associated with established socio-cultural and
   pedagogical practices. Towards this end, we reflect on potential
   contributions of social-cultural and learning theories to the task of
   managing content in e-learning environments. The paper presents an
   activity-centred approach to abstracting contextually and pedagogically
   enriched metadata descriptions of educational content and interactions
   with learning objects.

AB This study compared Pairs of students with Single students in web
   search tasks. The underlying hypothesis was that peer-to-peer
   collaboration encourages students to articulate their thoughts, which
   in turn has a facilitative effect on the regulation of the search
   process as well as search outcomes. Both hypotheses were supported by
   the results. Pairs located the target information more often and in
   less time than Singles did. Pairs also employed a richer repertoire of
   search strategies and were more proficient in monitoring and evaluating
   their search behaviour. Implications of these findings for practice and
   further research are discussed.

TI Audiences' judgements of speakers who use multimedia as a presentation
   aid: a contribution to training and assessment
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMUNICATION; ONLINE; VIDEO
AB Multimedia technology in principle may help speakers to deliver more
   effective presentations. The present study examined what effectiveness
   might mean in terms of audience reaction. Understanding that may help
   educators to use multimedia more effectively themselves and to help
   their students to do so. Descriptors were elicited from audiences in
   response to a total of 56 live presentations in which speakers used
   multimedia as a presentation aid. Forty-two rating scales were defined.
   A total of 20 presentations were rated using the scales, with the
   scales presented in one of two different random orders. The order did
   not appear to affect the ratings. A factor analysis suggests that three
   factors may be most important in describing the audiences' responses.
   The first describes audience assessment of how well researched and
   informative the presentation seemed. The second concerns the design of
   the multimedia, including how creative and imaginative it was. The
   third reflects how entertaining and how much fun the audience felt the
   experience as a whole to be. The results suggest a three-factor model
   that might be useful when designing multimedia-supported presentations,
   for providing proactive guidance and feedback when training speakers,
   and for assessment purposes.

TI What campus-based students think about the quality and benefits of
   e-learning
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB There is a trend in Irish universities to utilise the benefits of the
   e-learning as a mechanism to improve learning performance of
   campus-based students. Whilst traditional methods, such as face-to-face
   lectures, tutorials, and mentoring, remain dominant in the educational
   sector, universities are investing heavily in learning technologies, to
   facilitate improvements with respect to the quality of learning. The
   technology to support reuse and sharing of educational resources, or
   learning objects, is becoming more stable, with interoperability
   standards maturing. However, debate has raged about what constitutes
   effective use of learning technology.
   This research expands upon a study carried out in 2003 examining
   students' perceptions of e-learning in a large undergraduate accounting
   class environment. As a result, improvements were made to the
   instructional design of the course, to enable students to engage
   interactively with content. The subsequent study, reported in this
   paper, adopted a broad range of techniques to understand students'
   learning experience in depth. The findings of this research provide an
   insight into how these students really work and learn using
   technologies, if at all. It is hoped that our findings will improve the
   experience for both students and lecturers who engage in teaching and
   learning through this medium.

AB Technology is integral to carrying out many types of business
   transactions and has become entwined in the very fabric of everyday
   life. In the educational environment-particularly higher
   education-technology is underutilised as a pedagogical tool and in many
   cases remains largely untapped. Winona State University and its laptop
   programme learned some valuable lessons from the marriage between the
   application of the Seven Principles of Good Practice in Undergraduate

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
AB This paper presents one case of broadband-enabled learning ( BEL)
   involving geo-culturally and organisationally diverse collaboration
   using music as the vehicle. Findings from five evaluations over a
   15-month period were considered in relation to issues of relative
   advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability.
   Advantages included access to mentors, peers, and experts; support for
   cross-cultural and linguistic collaboration, interaction, and
   exchanges; promotion of a more open classroom; and exposure to
   alternative and new experiences. Compatibility with existing practices
   was evident, however, cross-cultural interaction presented difficulties
   as did synchronous communication across time zones and between
   institutions. BEL technologies are complex, however, users can develop
   a capacity to use the tools if provided with adequate support.
   Trialability is dependent on access to a high-speed connection and
   equipment, multiple partners, development of technical expertise, and
   support. Use of videoconferencing and choice of subject area can
   enhance observability.

TI Implementation and evaluation of computer-aided Mandarin phonemes
   training system for hearing-impaired students
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PLAYFULNESS; GENDER; PERSONALITY; SPEECH
AB A computer-aided Mandarin phonemes training (CAMPT) system was
   developed and evaluated for training hearing-impaired students in their
   pronunciation of Mandarin phonemes. Deaf or hearing-impaired people
   have difficulty hearing their own voice, hence most of them cannot
   learn how to speak. Phonemes are the basis for learning to read and
   speak in Mandarin. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to use
   voice-recognition techniques to develop a Mandarin phoneme training
   system for the self-training of hearing-impaired people. The system
   analyses the spoken Mandarin phoneme of a hearing-impaired person,
   compares it with the phonemes database, and shows the results on the
   computer monitor. Our CAMPT system helps hearing-impaired people
   pronounce Mandarin phonemes, and the system automatically gives the
   learner a percentage score for each phoneme. In other words, learners
   can receive instant feedback from the system. Experiments conducted
   among high school students diagnosed with hearing impairment revealed
   that our system can help students learn the Mandarin phonemes with a
   neural net recognition algorithm for different users. After five
   months, most learners can pronounce 95% of the phonemes correctly.

AB Recent developments in learning technology such as hypermedia is
   becoming widespread and offer significant contribution to improve the
   delivery of learning and teaching materials. A key factor in the
   development of hypermedia learning system is cognitive style (CS) as it
   relates to users' information processing habits, representing
   individual user's typical modes of perceiving, thinking, remembering
   and problem solving. The sample comprised of 217 students from Murdoch
   University who were enrolled in a first-year undergraduate unit. A
   survey was carried out every second semester over a period of 3 years
   (1999-2001). Both generalized linear model and tree-based regression
   were used to analyse the interaction among the learning dimensions and
   the effect on students' CS. When comparing both models, tree-based
   regression outperformed generalized linear model in this study. The
   research findings indicated that nonlinear learning is the primary
   dimension that determines students' CS. This is subsequently, followed
   by multiple tools (MT) and learner control (LC) dimensions. The results
   also confirm that background information has effects on students' CS.
   The overall findings suggest that students' preference of learning
   dimensions such as linear vs. non-linear, level of LC and the range of
   MT must be taken into consideration in order to enrich students'
   quality of education by means of motivating students' acquisition of
   subject matter through individualize instruction when designing,
   developing, and delivering educational resources. (c) 2004 Elsevier

AB Laboratory exercises, field observations and field trips are a
   fundamental part of many earth science and environmental science
   courses. Field observations and field trips can be constrained because
   of distance, time, expense, scale, safety, or complexity of real-world
   environments. Our objectives were to develop an environmental virtual
   field laboratory to study environmental properties and processes that
   stimulate the higher-order cognitive skills of students. We considered
   the following criteria for our virtual field laboratory: (i) global
   access, i.e., web-based implementation; (ii) simulation of a variety of
   learning mechanisms; (iii) interactivity to engage students; (iv)
   compartmentalization and hierarchical organizational structure; (v)
   abstraction of 2D and 3D geographic objects (e.g. soils, terrain) and
   dynamic ecosystem processes (e.g. water flow) using geostatistics and
   scientific visualization techniques. Cognitive science was considered
   during the design of our computer-aided instructional tools to enhance
   the effectiveness for learning. Our virtual field laboratory mimicked
   the students' learning processes that operate during real field trips
   and/or field observations; and provided students with a simulation
   environment to study environmental processes in space and time that
   cannot be provided on a real field trip. We implemented the following
   learning mechanisms: (i) exploration-based learning; (ii) analogy-based
   learning; (iii) science inquiry learning; (iv) abstraction-based
   learning. To engage students in our environmental virtual field
   laboratory, we implemented multiple interactivity functions including
   the exploration of 3D models and adaptive selective simulations. We
   used Virtual Reality Modeling Language, Java, Java Script, and External
   Authoring Interface to develop the environmental virtual field
   laboratory for a 42-ha flatwood site in Florida for which extensive
   datasets existed. Our digital learning environment offers potential to
   enhance existing on-campus courses and/or distance education courses.

AB This paper investigates the accessibility and attractiveness of
   different types of ICT applications in education for girls and boys and
   for pupils from families with an ethnic minority background and from
   the majority population in the Netherlands. A study was conducted in
   seven schools (primary and secondary). Data were collected on
   participation, ICT skills and learning results, ICT attitudes and the
   learning approach of pupils. A total of 213 pupils completed a
   questionnaire and interviews were held with 48 pupils and 12 teachers.
   Gender differences, especially in primary education, appeared to be
   small. In secondary education, the computer attitude of girls seems to
   be less positive than that of boys, girls and boys take on different
   tasks when working together on the computer and they tackle ICT tasks
   differently. Pupils from an ethnic-minority background in both primary
   and secondary education appear to consider themselves to be less
   skilled ICT users than pupils from the majority population. We found
   ethnic differences in participation in ICT activities at school in both
   educational sectors. Pupils from an ethnic-minority background use the
   computer at school less for gathering information and preparing talks
   and papers and more for drill and practice. Differences between pupils
   from an ethnic-minority background and from the majority population in
   access to certain forms of ICT use out of school are confirmed at
   school instead of being compensated for. The paper concludes with some
   recommendations on a diversity-oriented ICT policy at school level. (c)

DT Article
DE applications in subject areas; interactive learning environments;

AB The traditional educational approach with students as passive
   recipients has been the subject of criticism. A constructivist
   learner-centered approach towards education has been argued to produce
   greater internalization and application of knowledge compared to the
   traditional teacher-centered, transmission-oriented approach.
   Nevertheless, contemporary instructional design models argue for the
   use and integration of both approaches especially in complex learning
   tasks. This paper describes GeogDL, a Web-based application developed
   above a digital library of geographical resources for Singapore
   students preparing to take a national examination in geography. GeogDL
   is unique in that it not only provides an environment for active
   learning, it also adopts a pragmatic approach to learning that
   recognizes the importance of examinations especially in the Singapore
   education system. The paper discusses the components within the system
   that permit teachers to facilitate active student learning, to draw
   interconnections, and to promote knowledge sharing and collaboration.
   GeogDL was pilot-tested on a group of secondary school students in
   Singapore and the results suggested the viability of the system and
   also provided direction for future development. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We present an innovative way to manage online learning by administering
   experiential learning activities during a semester-long, web-based
   course that is designed with the Project Oriented Learning methodology.
   A consulting-style guiding thread for in-class and remote workshops is
   implemented using a professionally relevant project contract that
   describes teamwork actions. Specific project goals and deliverables are
   negotiated and a workplan is asserted in an XML database. Performance
   by a team is measured according to cumulative success or failure in one
   or more milestones that lead to such goals. We present an inference
   mechanism that reveals the behavior of a team, in terms of compromise,
   competition, precision, self-motivation, or individualism on every
   milestone session. Such behavior becomes evidence used by the
   instructor to scaffold students, both individually and as groups. This
   research embraces both content and activity management. (c) 2004

AB In this paper, we propose an auxiliary location network, to support
   user-independent context-awareness in educational data networks; for
   example, to help visitors in a museum. We assume that, in such
   scenarios, there exist service servers that need to be aware of user
   location in real-time. Specifically, we propose the implementation of a
   Bluetooth Location Network (BLN). The BLN is composed of small wireless
   nodes, which establish an spontaneous network topology at system
   initialization, and interact with Bluetooth-enabled user terminals
   (WLAN or GPRS PDAs, or WAP phones) or independent Bluetooth modems
   (badges). The BLN may coexist with any data protocol (IP over IEEE
   802.11b or GPRS, WAP). We do not impose specialized terminal
   programming for location purposes, since we rely on basic Bluetooth
   signaling (responses to inquiry cycles). We evaluate BLN feasibility in
   two real educational scenarios, a school and a museum. (c) 2004

AB The Cultural Journeys in the Information Society is a dynamic
   hypermedia environment, which proposes the Electronic Roads as a
   meta-form for exploring cultural information that can form Cultural
   Journeys. The Electronic Roads meta-form facilitates travelers to
   explore the information space in a natural and continuous way similar
   to the exploration of physical roads. This meta-form is advantageous
   over existing cultural exploration approaches, which usually apply only
   to discrete information spaces, failing to provide users with
   continuous explorations and as a result users may lose their intended
   destinations. The proposed environment provides extendable cultural and
   historical content for three Mediterranean countries, i.e. Cyprus,
   Jordan and Egypt.
   Such a system could be ideal for teaching history and culture;
   therefore several Learning Activities have been developed in this
   context. The learning effectiveness of the environment was evaluated in
   primary schools in Cyprus, where pupils were asked to complete specific
   Learning Activities by either using the Cultural Journeys in the
   Information Society environment or a static hypermedia system. The
   results showed that the pupils found our environment to be easier to
   use, compared to the static system and that the performance of the
   pupils that used it was significantly higher. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The purpose of this paper is to show how data mining may offer promise
   as a strategy for discovering and building alternative representations
   for the data underlying asynchronous discussion forums. Presently, the
   instructor's view of the output of a threaded forum is limited to
   reviewing a transcript or print version of the written dialogue
   produced by participants. With potentially hundreds of contributions to
   review for an entire online course, the instructor lacks a
   comprehensive view of the information embedded in the transcript. In
   this context, the authors attempt to sort out the question, "what is
   data from an online forum?" among other key questions. The present work
   seeks to intersect the information (i.e., participation indicators) an
   instructor may wish to extract from the forum with viewable and useful
   information that the system could produce from the instructor's query.
   Temporal participation indicators are used to show how using data and
   text mining techniques in the query process could improve the
   instructor's ability to evaluate the progress of a threaded discussion.

AB Effective collaboration in computer-mediated settings among spatially
   distributed people is a precondition for success in many new teaming
   and working contexts but it is hard to achieve. We have developed two
   instructional approaches to improve collaboration in such settings by
   promoting people's capabilities to collaborate in a fruitful way and
   furthering their understanding of what characterizes good
   collaboration. The rationale is that strategies necessary for a good
   and effective computer-mediated collaboration may be conveyed to people
   by exposing them to an elaborated worked-out collaboration example
   (observational learning) or by giving them the opportunity to learn
   from scripted collaborative problem-solving. An experimental study was
   conducted that compared teaming from observing a worked-out
   collaboration example with the teaming effects of scripted
   collaborative problem-solving, the effects of unscripted collaborative
   problem-solving, and a control condition without a teaming phase. The
   experimental design provided clearly separated phases for the
   instructional treatments (teaming phase) and for applying and testing
   the acquired skills (application phase). Both observing a worked-out
   collaboration example and collaborating with a script during the
   teaming phase showed positive effects on process and outcome of the
   second collaboration in the application phase.

AB Educational technology supports meaningful learning and enables the
   presentation of spatial and dynamic images, which portray relationships
   among complex concepts. The Technology-Enabled Active Learning (TEAL)
   Project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) involves
   media-rich software for simulation and visualization in freshman
   physics carried out in a specially redesigned classroom to facilitate
   group interaction. These technology-based learning materials are
   especially useful in electromagnetism to help students conceptualize
   phenomena and processes. This study analyzes the effects of the unique
   learning environment of the TEAL project on students' cognitive and
   affective outcomes. The assessment of the project included examining
   students' conceptual understanding before and after studying
   electromagnetism in a media-rich environment. We also investigated the
   effect of this environment on students' preferences regarding the
   various teaching methods. As part of the project, we developed pre- and
   posttests consisting of conceptual questions from standardized tests,
   as well as questions designed to assess the effect of visualizations
   and experiments. The research population consisted of 811 undergraduate
   students. It consisted of a small- and a large-scale experimental
   groups and a control group. TEAL students improved their conceptual
   understanding of the subject matter to a significantly higher extent
   than their control group peers. A majority of the students in the
   small-scale experiment noted that they would recommend the TEAL course
   to fellow students, indicating the benefits of interactivity,
   visualization, and hands-on experiments, which the technology helped
   enable. In the large-scale implementation students expressed both
   positive and negative attitudes in the course survey.

ID LEARNING-DISABILITIES; EDUCATION; COMPREHENSION; INSTRUCTION; TEACHERS
AB Institutions of higher education, states, and local K- 12 districts
   have been challenged to improve math and science education for our
   nation's students. In the past few years, there has been renewed
   interest in inquiry-based, activity-oriented instruction in science for
   students with disabilities. Yet, there still exists the need for
   further empirical evidence to support instructional improvements for
   students with more involved emotional and behavioral disabilities. This
   study describes a program in which 18 middle school students with
   serious emotional disturbances were instructed, over the course of 8
   weeks, on "Matter" by two different instructional approaches. Students
   in one classroom received a traditional textbook approach to science
   content, whereas students in another classroom received science
   instruction by a hands-on, thematic approach. Over the course of
   instruction, data were collected regarding students' behavior and
   achievement. Results indicate that, overall, students in the hands-on
   instructional program performed significantly better than the students
   in the textbook program on two of three measures of science
   achievement, a hands-on assessment and a short-answer test. The
   students did not differ on a multiplechoice format test. With regard to
   behavior, there were no significant differences in behavioral problems
   found between the two groups of students over the course of the study.
   Findings are discussed in relation to instructional implications for
   students with disabilities in the science classroom. (C) 2005 Wiley

AB In this study we investigate how prior knowledge influences knowledge
   development during collaborative discovery learning. Fifteen dyads of
   students (pre-university education, 15-16 years old) worked on a
   discovery learning task in the physics field of kinematics. The
   (face-to-face) communication between students was recorded and the
   interaction with the environment was logged. Based on students'
   individual judgments of the truth-value and "testability" of a series
   of domain-specific propositions, a detailed description of the
   "knowledge configuration" for each dyad was created before they entered
   the learning environment. Qualitative analyses of two dialogues
   illustrated that prior knowledge influences the discovery learning
   processes, and knowledge development in a pair of students. Assessments
   of student and dyad definitional (domain- specific) knowledge, generic
   (mathematical and graph) knowledge, and generic (discovery) skills were
   related to the students' dialogue in different discovery learning
   processes. Results show that a high level of definitional prior
   knowledge is positively related to the proportion of communication
   regarding the interpretation of results. Heterogeneity with respect to
   generic prior knowledge was positively related to the number of
   utterances made in the discovery process categories "hypotheses
   generation" and "experimentation." Results of the qualitative analyses
   indicated that collaboration between extremely heterogeneous dyads is
   difficult when the high achiever is not willing to scaffold information
   and work in the low achiever's zone of proximal development. (C) 2005

AB To promote large-scale science education reform, developers must create
   innovations that teachers can use to learn and enact new practices. As
   part of an urban systemic reform effort, science materials were
   designed to reflect desired reforms and to support teacher thinking by
   addressing necessary content, pedagogy, and pedagogical content
   knowledge for teachers. The goal of this research was to describe
   teachers' enactments in comparison to reform as instantiated in the
   materials. Four middle school teachers' initial enactment of an
   inquiry-based science unit on force and motion were analyzed. Findings
   indicate two teachers' enactments were consistent with intentions and
   two teachers' enactments were not. However, enactment ratings for the
   first two were less reflective of curriculum intent when challenges
   were greatest, such as when teachers attempted to present challenging
   science ideas, respond to students' ideas, structure investigations,
   guide small-group discussions, or make adaptations. Overall, findings
   suggest that purposefully using materials with detailed lesson
   descriptions and specific, consistent supports for teacher thinking can
   help teachers with enactment. However, materials alone are not
   sufficient; reform efforts must include professional development and
   efforts to create systemic change in context and policy to support
   teacher learning and classroom enactment. (C) 2005 Wiley Periodicals,

AB Planned educational change occurs regularly throughout the world. With
   the enormous political change the 1994 elections brought to South
   Africa, a complete change in education policies was called for. The new
   Curriculum 2005 (C2005; Department of Education, RSA, 1997) embraced
   new teaching and learning approaches such as outcomes-based education
   and leamer-centered teaching practices. To explore the progress of the
   implementation of C2005, a theoretical framework specifically designed
   to elucidate curriculum implementation in developing countries was
   applied to 10 case studies. The framework consists of interrelating
   constructs with subconstructs, which impact on curriculum
   implementation. It enables one to look at the levels of implementation
   achieved both in terms of the capacity of the school and the extent to
   which outside support and pressure is provided. The case studies were
   carried out in a representative sample of schools in Mpumalanga, one of
   the nine South African provinces. ne aim of this article is to
   investigate the possible interrelationships of the constructs and the
   subconstructs. Some predictable relationships emerged from the data
   while other expected relationships failed to materialize. (C) 2005

AB This study examined the impact of an inquiry-based instructional
   intervention on (a) children's ability to conduct science inquiry
   overall and to use specific, skills in inquiry, and (b) narrowing the
   gaps in children's ability among demographic subgroups of students. The
   intervention consisted of instructional units, teacher workshops, and
   classroom practices. The study involved 25 third- and fourthgrade
   students from six elementary schools representing diverse linguistic
   and cultural groups. Quantitative results demonstrated that the
   intervention enhanced the inquiry ability of all students regardless of
   grade, achievement, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), home
   language, and English proficiency. Particularly, low-achieving,
   low-SES, and English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) exited
   students made impressive gains. The study adds to the existing
   literature on designing learning environments that foster science
   inquiry of all elementary students. (C) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This paper describes a study of the extent of teacher-educators'
   engagement in research and their attitudes and beliefs towards academic
   autonomy and accountability, in relation to research. The findings from
   a survey questionnaire and a set of unstructured interviews indicate
   that at most 25% of faculty at the college are involved in research. It
   was found that the more respondents are engaged in research and the
   more highly qualified they are, the more they are likely to expect to
   be regarded as autonomous professionals. Furthermore, the
   accountability of teacher-educator researchers tends to be directed by
   norms, codes of practice and sets of values that are professionally
   imposed.

AB Group projects in computer science are normally delivered with
   reference to good software engineering practice. The discipline of
   software engineering is rapidly evolving, and the application of the
   latest 'agile techniques' to group projects causes a potential conflict
   with constraints imposed by regulating bodies on the computer science
   curriculum. This paper explores the issues, and argues that there are
   strong educational reasons for modifying the computer science
   curriculum to accommodate these new software engineering methodologies.

TI Discovering sequential concept patterns for behavioural diagnosis by

SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English

AB As web-based courses become more popular, web systems can accumulate
   large amounts of log data. Because this data is generated by learners'
   behaviour while studying web-based courses, many researchers agree that
   analysing web logs could benefit learners, instructors and web-site
   managers. This paper describes a study that used data-mining techniques
   in order to analyse learners' online behaviour for the purpose of
   extracting concept patterns-by transforming general web logs to a
   content perspective. An important advantage of this approach is that it
   can be used to identify concept patterns based on learning
   behaviour-rather than the more conventional browsing patterns based on
   browsing behaviour.

DT Article
ID FEEDBACK; STUDENTS
AB Web-based peer assessment is an innovative method that can be used to
   assess students' learning portfolios in order to improve their
   learning. However, students cannot easily compare their own evaluation
   schemes or think reflectively to improve their learning through
   web-based peer assessment if they do not understand how others perceive
   the assessment criteria. This study attempts to utilize knowledge
   acquisition techniques in order to elicit personal understanding of
   assessment criteria. Using repertory grid analysis, web-based peer
   assessment systems can elucidate personal conceptual frameworks and
   evaluation schemes when students use their own criteria to assess
   learning portfolios. The analysis provides an instrument for monitoring
   the students' conceptual frameworks-which may lead to different
   peer-teacher correlations regarding assessment. This instrument allows
   teachers and students to understand fully each other's conceptual
   frameworks and evaluation schemes-thereby allowing them to think
   reflectively and improve their learning.

AB Higher education institutions are responding to globalisation in
   various ways. This study describes and analyses challenges encountered
   in a recent case of global collaboration between four universities on
   different continents in developing a web-based master's program. The
   key issue was how to develop programs in a way that is fair for the
   different countries involved. The focus of the paper is on tensions
   between local and national contexts, rules and resources and the
   creation of a common global program. 'Agency', 'structure' and 'frame
   factor' are used as analytical concepts to help understand the dynamics
   of the collaboration and the character of the program.

   cognitive content of student messages were analysed. Females wrote more
   messages than males with no difference in the cognitive quality of
   message content. In mixed groups, females wrote fewer messages than in
   all-female groups but males wrote more messages than in all-male
   groups. Students' characteristics and views were described by 19
   variables. There were significant gender differences in 11. In multiple
   regression, the variables most positively related to the number of
   messages written per student were: a preference for discussions being
   online; and a high course grade. These partly explained why females

TI Assessment matters: some issues concerning the supervision and
   assessment of work-based doctorates
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Since 2000, 1 have been working towards a professional doctorate at
   Middlesex University, and I am also working to introduce a work-based
   doctorate at Coventry University. This paper looks at the issues of
   supervision and assessment for work-based doctorates, which, I believe,
   are key to the design of such a programme and affect both the output
   and outcome of a candidate's work. The paper is based on a review of
   literature and discussions with academics from a number of
   universities. It appears that work-based doctorates, and I include here
   professional doctorates and Doctor of Business Administration, are
   subject to the same supervision and assessment processes as a Ph.D. My
   contention, therefore, is that if supervision and assessment of a
   work-based doctorate mirrors what happens on a Ph.D., then candidates
   will produce work that is indistinguishable from a Ph.D., in which case
   why have a different doctoral award? As such this paper represents work
   in progress towards my doctorate, where I am a candidate, and the
   introduction of a work-based doctorate at Coventry, where I am the
   curriculum designer. It therefore is designed to raise points of
   concern rather than supply answers.

TI Bridging in-class participation with innovative instruction: use and
   implications in a Turkish university classroom
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Student-centred university classrooms not only support student learning
   but also provide a forum to practise the skills of democratic
   participation, a particularly important set of skills for citizens in
   young democracies like Turkey where this study takes place. Yet, often
   classroom assessment methods do not match these innovative teaching
   methods and, therefore, do not encourage students to increase and learn
   from their participation. This paper describes how two professors
   bridged innovative classroom instruction and student participation
   through the use of a detailed, written description of in-class
   participation. They document the changes in their classroom practices
   and the student responses to these innovations and assessments.

AB This paper offers an account of, and findings from, an approach to
   designing and evaluating an instructional sequence set in the context
   of Newton's third law. The design of the sequence draws upon conceptual
   change theory and the concept of the "bridging analogy" is extended to
   introduce the notion of a "bridging representation." Attention is also
   given in the instructional design to the proposed social interactions
   between teacher and students as the teaching and learning activities
   are played out or "staged" in the classroom. A range of instruments is
   used to measure the extent of student learning, and evidence is
   presented to indicate that the designed sequence leads to enhanced
   learning gains when compared to those achieved with an equivalent group
   of students. Although set in the context of teaching and learning about
   mechanics a number of general points are made in relation to both
   instructional design and perspectives on conceptual change. (C) 2004

ID SUBJECT-MATTER KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE; LIGHT; CLASSROOM; VISION; TOOLS
AB National assessments and other investigations have drawn attention to
   the fact that there is considerable room for improvement in science
   teaching and teaming. This article describes, exemplifies, and
   discusses a research program set up to address this unsatisfactory
   state of affairs. Briefly, the idea of the program is that researchers
   in science education and teachers in schools should work together to
   design teaching sequences and assess how they function in practice,
   including what the students learn. This work has two aims: first, to
   generate results of practical use, and second, to contribute to the
   development of educational science. Results of practical use are
   presented in the form of teacher's guides, written to be used as tools
   for generating further knowledge. As a contribution to educational
   science, attempts are made to formulate content-oriented theories of
   conditions that are likely to improve teaming with understanding. This
   article describes and discusses how the research program has been
   implemented in the area of geometrical optics at the upper level
   (grades 8 and 9) of compulsory school. It is suggested that the idea of
   content-oriented theories is worth further examination and development
   and might contribute to.,strengthening science education as an
   autonomous discipline. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In some contexts, a photograph may be worth a thousand words. Previous
   research revealed a dialectical character of photographs: they
   simultaneously lack determinacy and exhibit an excess of meaning. The
   purpose of this study was to understand how, under this condition, high
   school students interpret photographs that were accompanied by
   different amounts and types of cotext (caption, main text). The data
   for this study consists of video-recorded interviews with twelve
   Brazilian high school students. What students perceived was in part a
   function of the presence of caption and main text; these texts not only
   described what could be seen but also taught students how to look at
   photographs. We conclude that high school students not only need to
   develop subject matter literacy but also a literacy concerning
   photographs to fully understand their textbooks. (C) 2004 Wiley

AB What science-related knowledge is actually used by nurses in their
   day-to-day clinical reasoning when attending patients? The study
   investigated the knowledge-in-use of six acute-care nurses in a
   hospital surgical unit. It was found that the nurses mainly drew upon
   their professional knowledge of nursing and upon their procedural
   understanding that included a common core of "concepts of evidence"
   (concepts implicitly applied to the evaluation of data and the
   evaluation of evidence-the focus of this research). This core included
   validity triangulation, normalcy range, accuracy, and a general
   predilection for direct sensual access to a phenomenon over indirect
   machine-managed access. A cluster of emotion-related concepts of
   evidence (e.g. cultural sensitivity) was also discovered. These results
   add to a compendium of concepts of evidence published in the
   literature. Only a small proportion of nurses (one of the six nurses in
   the study) used canonical science content in their clinical reasoning,
   a result consistent with other research. This study also confirms
   earlier research on employees in science-rich workplaces in general,
   and on professional development programs for nurses specifically:
   canonical science content found in a typical science curriculum (e.g.
   high school physics) does not appear relevant to many nurses' know
   ledge-in-use. These findings support a curriculum policy that gives
   emphasis to students learning how to learn science content as required
   by an authentic everyday or workplace context, and to students learning
   concepts of evidence. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

SO SCIENCE EDUCATION

AB The understandings of properties that children develop in the context
   of rock and mineral identification point to the challenges of observing
   in a manner authentic to the discipline of geology. The notebook
   entries of 34 third graders written during the enactment of a
   commercial unit on earth materials were investigated for their
   descriptions of rocks and minerals, and the extent to which these
   reflect understandings of properties in both generic and
   discipline-specific senses. While children were successful in observing
   minute details of rock and mineral samples, there were few
   opportunities within the curriculum for students to differentiate
   between geologically relevant and irrelevant properties, and there were
   no connections drawn between deeper geological concepts and these
   observations. In addition, the demands placed on young learners to
   write their observations in the form of descriptions raise issues of
   supporting students in their learning of authentic scientific writing.
   There are challenges faced in representing geological observation
   authentically, and moving children beyond simple description activities
   into more complex explanations. Suggestions for improvements that
   attend to issues of the discipline as well as the elementary context
   are provided. (C) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Field-based education and indigenous knowledge: Essential components of
   geoscience education for native American communities
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CROSS-CULTURAL SCIENCE; WORLDVIEW; STUDENTS; SCHOOL
AB The purpose of this study is to propose a framework drawing on
   theoretical and empirical science education research that explains the
   common prominent field-based components of the handful of persistent
   and successful Earth science education programs designed for indigenous
   communities in North America. These programs are primarily designed for
   adult learners, either in a postsecondary or in a technical education
   setting and all include active collaboration between local indigenous
   communities and geoscientists from nearby universities. Successful
   Earth science curricula for indigenous learners share in common an
   explicit emphasis on outdoor education, a place and problem-based
   structure, and the explicit inclusion of traditional indigenous
   knowledge in the instruction. Programs sharing this basic design have
   proven successful and popular for a wide range of indigenous cultures
   across North America. We present an analysis of common field-based
   elements to yield insight into indigenous Earth science education. We
   provide an explanation for the success of this design based in research
   on field-based learning, Native American learning styles research, and
   theoretical and empirical research into the nature and structure of
   indigenous knowledge. We also provide future research directions that
   can test and further refine our understanding of best practices in
   indigenous Earth science education. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In this study. students' views on the nature of science (NOS) were
   investigated with the use of a large-scale survey. An empirically
   derived multiple-choice format questionnaire was administered to 1702
   Korean 6th, 8th, and 10th graders. The questionnaire consisted of five
   items that respectively examined students' views on five constructs
   concerning the NOS: purpose of science, definition of scientific
   theory, nature of models, tentativeness of scientific theory, and
   origin of scientific theory. Students were also asked to respond to an
   accompanying open-ended section for each item in order to collect
   information about the rationale(s) for their choices. The results
   indicated that the majority of Korean students possessed an
   absolutist/empiricist perspective about the NOS. It was also found
   that, on the whole, there were no clear differences in the
   distributions of 6th, 8th, and 10th graders' views on the NOS. In some
   questions, distinct differences between Korean students and those of
   Western countries were found. Educational implications are discussed.

AB Scientific writing contains unique linguistic features that construe
   special realms of scientific knowledge, values, and beliefs. An
   understanding of the functionality of these features is critical to the
   development of literacy in science. This article describes some of the
   key linguistic features of scientific writing, discusses the challenges
   these features present to comprehension and composition of science
   texts in school, and argues for greater attention to the specialized
   language of science in teaching and learning. (C) 2004 Wiley

TI Dialogue: a theoretical framework for distance education instructional
   systems
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
ID TRANSACTIONAL DISTANCE
AB This paper presents a theoretical framework for viewing elements that
   comprise distance education instructional systems in terms of dialogue.
   It is assumed that learning is mediated by intrapersonal dialogue and
   facilitated by interpersonal dialogue. Every resource in a distance
   education instructional system (eg, instructor availability,
   asynchronous communication networks, self-instruction texts, etc) is
   analysed in terms of the dialogue mode it supports. The framework
   offers three advantages: (1) a unified, simple, and coherent
   description of the mechanisms at play in distance education systems,
   (2) clear-cut operational definitions, and (3) hypotheses that may be
   investigated empirically.

TI Children, play, and computers in pre-school education
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper reports a study designed to inform the development of an
   information and communication technology strategy for the pre-school
   years of education. The main methods of collecting evidence were
   observations at seven pre-school settings and interviews with at least
   two practitioners and a number of children at each site. Practitioners
   generally referred to children "playing with the computer". We describe
   some of the problems to be found in the emphasis on free play in
   nurseries and play groups when this means children are using computers
   as complete novices. There were few examples of peer support; adults
   rarely intervened or offered guidance and the most common form of
   intervention was reactive supervision. Interaction with a computer was
   therefore a limited experience for most children, but we provide
   examples of guided interaction that suggest a way forward for
   professional development.

TI A framework for fostering a community of practice: scaffolding learners
   through an evolving continuum
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper proposes a framework of an evolving community of
   practitioners along a simulation, participation, and codetermined
   interactions continuum. Simulation, participation, and codetermined
   interactions are three models of learning, which describe how learners
   can be brought through a scaffolded process within a community
   experience. The framework also focuses on the processes rather than on
   the outcomes or products of a community. In this paper, we describe a
   case study of a group of heads of Information and Communications
   Technology (ICT) in schools being scaffolded through an experiential
   workshop to achieve learning outcomes such as ICT-based project work
   (as product) and other constructivist dispositions of learning (as
   processes). The proposed framework is intended to be sufficiently broad
   so that learners are supported from simulation to codetermined
   interactions where autonomy of learners' co-construction efforts are
   encouraged and experienced.

TI Motivation and ability: which students use online learning and what
   influence does it have on their achievement?
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID WORLD-WIDE-WEB; HIGHER-EDUCATION; GENDER; PSYCHOLOGY; INTERNET; STYLE;
   ESSAY
AB There has been much recent research examining online learning in
   universities, but two questions seem to have been largely overlooked in
   this context: (1) Which students voluntarily utilise web-based
   learning; and (2) Does this use influence their academic achievement?
   The current study aimed to determine whether the approaches to
   studying, ability, age, and gender of 110 undergraduates in the second
   year of a psychology degree predicted the extent to which they utilised
   online learning using Web Course Tools (WebCT) in support of a core
   Biological Psychology unit. Data were obtained from WebCT's student
   tracking system, Entwistle and Ramsden's 18-item Approaches to Studying
   Inventory (1983) and academic records. Multiple linear regressions and
   discriminant function analysis were used to examine whether individual
   differences predicted WebCT use, while analysis of covariance
   determined whether web use influenced academic achievement. The number
   of hits, length of access, and use of the bulletin board was predicted
   by age, with older students using WebCT more. These factors were also
   influenced by ability and achievement orientation. The degree of
   participation in self-assessment was not predicted by student
   variables, but, of those that repeated an online quiz, improvement was
   more likely in those with lower achievement orientation. Only bulletin
   board use influenced achievement, with those posting messages
   outperforming those not using, or passively using bulletin boards.
   However, because individual differences will determine the extent to
   which students utilise this facility, it is suggested that future
   research should focus on developing online learning environments that
   incorporate activities with both a beneficial influence on learning and
   appeal to a wide student population.

   other three groups on well-structured problem-solving performance, it
   did not have an effect on ill-structured problem-solving performance.

TI User dyads in software testing: bypassing the need for expert observers
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper arises out of a research study into the online help
   facilities provided in popular software applications such as word
   processors. Its particular focus is on experimental methods of
   evaluating the effectiveness and usability of those facilities.
   Focus groups, questionnaires, and online surveys had already been used
   in other phases of the study, but it was judged that these approaches
   would be unsuitable for measuring effectiveness and usability because
   they are susceptible to respondents' subjectivity.
   Direct observation of people working on set word-processing tasks was
   ruled out initially because of a lack of trained observers; it would
   have taken too long for the investigator to observe a large enough
   sample by himself. Automatic recording of users' actions was also
   rejected, as it would have demanded equipment and/or software that was
   not available and seemed too expensive to acquire.
   The approach and techniques described here were an attempt to overcome
   these difficulties by using observers drawn from the same population of
   students that provided the test subjects; as a by-product, this may
   also have enhanced the acceptability (and hence possibly the validity)
   of the experiments by reducing the "exam pressure" perceived by
   participants.

TI An instructional model for web-based e-learning education with a
   blended learning process approach
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Web-based e-learning education research and development now focuses on
   the inclusion of new technological features and the exploration of
   software standards. However, far less effort is going into finding
   solutions to psychopedagogical problems in this new educational
   category. This paper proposes a psychopedagogical instructional model
   based on content structure, the latest research into information
   processing psychology and social contructivism, and defines a blended
   approach to the learning process. Technologically speaking, the
   instructional model is supported by learning objects, a concept
   inherited from the object-oriented paradigm.

AB University administrators are continuously investing in Information
   Technology (IT) to support learning and help deal with educational
   budget cuts. Instructors are increasingly making their teaching
   materials available on the Internet. While administrators and
   instructors would like to make the Internet an effective educational
   tool, they need to understand what their students' attitudes towards
   using it are. Since the use of the Internet in university education is
   still in its early stages, many issues regarding its use have not been
   fully addressed. This study was conducted to provide a better
   understanding of how the Internet is used in university learning from a
   student's perspective. Our research framework is based on the Theory of
   Reasoned Action, Technology Acceptance Model, and IT Diffusion Process
   Model. We use a survey conducted among university students to explore
   these issues. Research findings provide some useful insights for
   university administrators and educators.

TI Using the Internet in teaching: the views of practitioners (A survey of
   the views of secondary school teachers in Sheffield, UK)
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ICT
AB A questionnaire was generated from the results of a series of
   interviews at The City School one of the 27 state secondary schools in
   Sheffield. In October 2002, it was sent out to 499 Heads of Department
   at the remaining 26 state secondary schools. Responses were received
   from 188 teachers, ranging in age from 24 to 60 years old. The purpose
   of the questionnaire was to gain information about teachers' views of
   the Internet and its usefulness as an educational tool.
   Nearly 85% of teachers acquired their Internet skills informally
   (self-taught, learned from friends/colleagues, etc), rather than on a
   taught course. Despite this, most of the respondents were confident of
   their ability to use the Internet, with the most confident users being
   young teachers of technical subjects. However, there was a widespread
   perception (particularly amongst women teachers) that students are more
   competent users of the Internet than are teachers. Older teachers were
   more likely to feel under pressure to use the Internet than their
   younger colleagues.
   Only about a third of teachers agreed with the statement "I often use
   the Internet with classes." Responses varied significantly according to
   school and subject. There was strong support, however, for the
   suggestion that the Internet is a valuable source of learning and
   teaching materials.

TI An investigation into students' use of a computer-based social learning
   space: lessons for facilitating collaborative approaches to learning
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Provision of computers in universities for self-study is taken for
   granted and is seen as a "must have" educational resource, yet it is
   very expensive to fund. Students report that they use the Internet as
   their first stop in approaching research tasks. Learning theorists
   posit the important role of social interaction in contributing to
   learning. The use of collaborative methodologies such as group work
   also illustrate the importance, and perceived beneficial role of,
   learning with others. However, in general, student access to computers
   for self-study in UK Higher Education is provided through large rooms
   furnished with serried ranks of computers, which do not allow or
   encourage computer-based collaborative working. This study addresses
   this mismatch between approaches to learning and the way universities
   make computers available to learners. The University of Wolverhampton
   provides a social learning space with 24 computers on four
   fishbone-shaped tables, in a room without any restrictions on talking,
   eating, or drinking. It was provided so as to encourage learners to
   work collaboratively and to be able to integrate the use of a computer
   whilst doing so. This paper reports the initial findings of a study
   into its use, through questionnaires, observational data, and
   interviews. Has the provision of a computer-based collaborative
   learning space positively affected approaches to computer-based
   self-study? The results of this study inform how best Higher Education
   institutions might provide computer access to learners so as to
   encourage collaborative working and positively affect student
   approaches to their learning.

TI Morphing images: a potential tool for teaching word recognition to
   children with severe learning difficulties
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Children with severe learning difficulties who fail to begin word
   recognition can learn to recognise pictures and symbols relatively
   easily. However, finding an effective means of using pictures to teach
   word recognition has proved problematic. This research explores the use
   of morphing software to support the transition from picture to word
   recognition. Morphing software was used to teach word recognition to a
   group of eight children who were previously unable to recognise words.
   At the end of 16 teaching sessions, in a related design, the morphing
   technique was more effective than a word-alone approach ( p < 0.05,
   one-tailed). These results support the use of techniques such as symbol
   accentuation (Miller & Miller, 1971) and challenge the concept that the
   use of pictorial information is inherently detrimental to learning in
   this context, in comparison to the repeated presentation of words
   alone. The recent advent of accessible morphing software removes
   previous barriers to this type of approach. The investigation
   highlights several useful avenues for future research, in particular,
   the use of mnemonic elements within morphing teaching methods.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
AB This study aimed to find out whether integrating accent reduction
   software in advanced English language classes at the university level
   would result in improvements in students' pronunciation at the
   segmental and sup-rasegmental levels. The study made use of a
   quasi-experimental research design. Two classes at the Department of
   Foreign Language Education at Middle East Technical University in
   Turkey participated in the study. Whilst one class (the control group)
   followed traditional instruction, the other class (experimental group)
   followed instruction which integrated use of accent reduction software
   in a multimedia language laboratory. Based on the results of the study,
   it is suggested that especially in English as a Foreign Language (EFL)
   settings where natural target language input is scarce, technology has
   a lot to offer, and EFL learners may be provided with exposure and
   practice/interaction opportunities in the target language through
   specifically designed software programs.

   The study used a pretest-intervention-posttest experimental design.
   Results showed that students who did not have computers at home
   initially had lower geometry scores. However, these differences were
   minimised with an appropriate intervention containing computer-based
   Tangram puzzles. This suggests that at schools, it seems more effective
   to integrate mathematical content and technology in a manner that
   enables students to do playful mathematical discoveries.

AB The purpose of this study was twofold. One purpose was to identify the
   locally negotiated literate practices that defined ways of
   communicating information and knowledge across the curriculum in a
   fourth/fifth grade classroom. Through an ethnographic and
   sociolinguistic set of analyses, this investigation illustrated how the
   teacher worked to construct a learning environment that valued the use
   of multiple discourses as a way of communicating competence as a
   learner. Another purpose was specifically to address the ways that
   these practices contributed to student demonstration of knowledge in
   science. This was accomplished by an analysis of one student's
   presentation of science knowledge after a study of simple machines. A
   comparative analysis between his use of two discourses, written and
   oral, showed that the opportunity to choose between multiple discourses
   led to his success in demonstrating competence in ways that may have
   otherwise remained questionable. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB We examine the equivalence of two construct-a-concept-map techniques:
   construct-a-map with created linking phrases (C), and construct-a-map
   with selected linking phrases (S). The former places few constraints on
   the respondent and has been considered the gold standard; the latter is
   cost and time efficient. Both their products and processes are compared
   quantitatively and qualitatively as to total accuracy score, individual
   proposition scores, proposition choice, map structure complexity,
   proposition generation rate, and proposition generation procedures. We
   conclude that the two mapping techniques are not equivalent: The C
   technique is better than the S technique in capturing students' partial
   knowledge, even though the S can be scored more efficiently than C.
   Based on their characteristics, if used as an assessment tool, the C
   technique is more suitable for formative assessment while the S
   technique is a better fit for large-scale assessments. (C) 2005 Wiley

TI Toward implementing distributed scaffolding: Helping students learn
   science from design
SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING
LA English
DT Article
ID METAPHOR; DISABILITIES; UTILITY; FIELD; VIEW
AB In this article, we present two studies that helped us understand the
   kinds of support that students need to learn science successfully from
   design activities. Both were enacted in the context of an approach to
   learning science from design called learning by design (LBD). In our
   first study, we designed and integrated a paper-and-pencil scaffolding
   tool, the design diary, into an LBD unit to support students'
   design-related activities. We learned two important lessons from the
   first study. First, we refined our understanding of the processes
   involved in designing and the ways we might present those processes to
   students. Second, and more important, we observed that in the dynamic,
   complex environment of the classroom, not all of the scaffolding could
   be provided with any one tool or agent. We found that students need
   multiple forms of support and multiple learning opportunities to learn
   science successfully from design activities. In our next study, we
   provided additional support through an organized system of tools and
   agents. Our analysis of data from the second stud leads us to believe
   that supporting multiple students in a classroom requires us to rethink
   the notion of scaffolding as it applied to groups of learners in a
   classroom. We put forth the notion of distributed scaffolding as an
   approach to supporting hands-on inquiry learning in a classroom. (C)

TI Substantive-level theory of highly regarded secondary biology teachers'
   science teaching orientations
SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING
LA English
DT Article
ID SUBJECT-MATTER KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION; CONCEPTIONS
AB Science teaching orientations, defined as teachers' knowledge and
   beliefs about the purposes and goals for teaching science, have been
   identified as a critical component within the proposed pedagogical
   content knowledge (PCK) model for science teaching. Because of the
   scarcity of empirical studies in this area, this case study examined
   the nature and sources of science teaching orientations held by four
   highly regarded secondary biology teachers. Data sources consisted of
   transcripts from four interviews, a card-sorting task, and classroom
   observations. Using a grounded theory framework, inductive data
   analysis led to the construction of a substantive-level theory for this
   group of participants. In regard to the nature of science teaching
   orientations, the use of central and peripheral goals, as well as the
   means of achieving these goals, was used to represent the complex
   nature of participants' science teaching orientations. The
   participants' science teaching orientations included goals related to
   general schooling, the affective domain, and subject matter, although
   the latter was not always a central component. In regard to the sources
   of teaching orientations, participants were strongly influenced by the
   classroom context and their beliefs about learners and learning;
   additional influences included prior work experiences, professional
   development, and time constraints. (C) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This paper presents the results of a literature review on gender,
   ethnic and socioeconomic status differences related to ICT in primary
   and secondary education. The review was conducted in order to develop
   an index for analysing the inclusiveness of educational ICT
   applications. The research question was: 'How and to what extent do the
   characteristics of educational ICT tools enhance or inhibit learning
   for different groups of students?' A discussion of both research- and
   practice-oriented literature results in a proposal for such an index.
   The paper concludes with a discussion of various dilemmas associated
   with the idea of the index, and of the ways in which it may be used in
   research and educational practice.

AB The present study examined the long-term effects of a computer
   intervention for the development of phonological awareness in Dutch
   kindergartners. Native Dutch and immigrant children worked with the
   software 15 min/week during one school year. Following a pretest -
   interim test - post-test - retention test design, the effects on
   rhyming, phonemic segmentation, auditory blending, and grapheme
   knowledge were assessed. The intervention showed significant immediate
   effects on rhyming and grapheme knowledge. The time spent on the
   computer games also correlated with the learning gains for the
   experimental group. In the first grade, retention effects were
   demonstrated after 4 months of formal reading education.

AB This study first explores intermediate-level English learners'
   preferences for hypermedia annotations while they are engaged in
   reading a hypermedia text. Second, it examines whether multimedia
   annotations facilitate reading comprehension in the second language.
   The participants were 44 adult learners of English as a foreign
   language studying English for Academic Purposes. Data were collected
   through a tracking tool, a reading comprehension test, a questionnaire,
   and interviews. Results indicate that learners preferred visual
   annotations significantly more than textual and audio annotations. On
   the other hand, a negative relationship was found between annotation
   use and reading comprehension. Especially, pronunciations,
   audiorecordings, and videos were found to affect reading comprehension
   negatively. However, the qualitative data revealed that the
   participants had positive attitudes towards annotations and hypermedia
   reading in general.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate students' use of cognitive
   learning strategies in inquiry-based computer-supported collaborative
   learning (CSCL). A process-oriented interview framework on cognitive
   activity, self-regulation and motivation, and a coding category for
   analysing cognitive learning strategies and cognitive self-regulation
   was developed. The students of an intervention group (n=18)
   participating in inquiry-based CSCL and a comparison group (n=8) were
   interviewed six to eight times during the 3 years of the study. The
   results derived from the mixed-method analysis of altogether 161
   interviews were compared between the two groups. The results indicate
   that the students who participated in the inquiry-based CSCL activities
   reported deeper-level cognitive strategies such as monitoring, creating
   representations and sharing information collaboratively. The students
   of the comparison group reported more surface-level strategies such as
   memorization. However, the findings concerning the utility of CSCL
   inquiry on cognitive learning strategies were not uniformly positive.
   It was found that the students of the comparison group reported
   significantly more strategies under the category of content evaluation.
   Nevertheless, the results suggest that computer-supported inquiry-based
   learning can enhance the use of cognitive strategies that support
   learning.

AB Prior knowledge is often argued to be an important determinant in
   hypermedia learning, and may be thought of as including two important
   elements: domain expertise and system expertise. However, there has
   been a lack of research considering these issues together. In an
   attempt to address this shortcoming, this paper presents a study that
   examines how domain expertise and system expertise influence students'
   learning performance in, and perceptions of, a hypermedia system. The
   results indicate that participants with lower domain knowledge show a
   greater improvement in their learning performance than those with
   higher domain knowledge. Furthermore, those who enjoy using the Web
   more are likely to have positive perceptions of non-linear interaction.
   Discussions on how to accommodate the different needs of students with
   varying levels of prior knowledge are provided based on the results.

AB Web-based technology has a dramatic impact on learning and teaching. A
   framework that delineates the relationships between learner control and
   learning effectiveness is absent. This study aims to fill this void.
   Our work focuses on the effectiveness of a technology-mediated virtual
   learning environment (TVLE) in the context of basic information
   technology skills training. Grounded in the technology-mediated
   learning literature, this study presents a framework that addresses the
   relationship between the learner control and learning effectiveness,
   which contains four categories: learning achievement, self-efficacy,
   satisfaction, and learning climate. In order to compare the learning
   effectiveness under traditional classroom and TVLE, we conducted a
   field experiment. Data were collected from a junior high school of
   Taiwan. A total of 210 usable responses were analysed. We identified
   four results from this study. (1) Students in the TVLE environment
   achieve better learning performance than their counterparts in the
   traditional environment; (2) Students in the TVLE environment report
   higher levels of computer self-efficacy than their counterparts in the
   traditional environment; (3) Students in the TVLE environment report
   higher levels of satisfaction than students in the traditional
   environment; and (4) Students in the TVLE environment report higher
   levels of learning climate than their counterparts in the traditional
   environment. The implications of this study are discussed, and further
   research directions are proposed.

AB The development of innovative and competitive products and mastery of
   IT&T technologies are crucial for a company's long-term success in the
   global market. The main flag bearers for development are product
   developers, but it is questionable whether the existing systems are
   appropriate for the education of such professionals. For example, one
   study found large deficiencies concerning their skills in group
   interaction and ability to translate thoughts into action. Based on
   these and similar findings, a decision was made to organize an
   international course that would help students become competent members
   of product development teams. Integrated product development is a
   demanding and complex activity as it is, and its level of difficulty is
   additionally increased by the ever-changing business environment,
   primarily by functional associating of geographically disperse human
   resources. The paper describes the E-GPR (European Global Product
   Realization) course program, the used IT&T technologies, the way
   international teams were formed and the experiences and findings of the
   students, company representatives and lecturers who participated in
   this course. The authors believe that realism is the main strength of
   the course. Based on positive responses of all participants, the
   organizers decided to continue and further improve the E-GPR course.

AB This study investigates gender differences in Internet use by Greek
   high school pupils within school and out of school environments. A
   sample of 340 pupils (170 boys and 170 girls), aged 12-16 years,
   completed a written questionnaire on their attainability, location,
   frequency and purposes of Internet access. The data analysis showed
   that more pupils use the Internet outside school (at home, in Internet
   cafes) than within school and that boys have more opportunities to
   access the Internet. Both inside and outside school, pupils' favourite
   Internet activities relate to information gathering for personal
   purposes and to entertainment. Boys use the Internet for entertainment
   and Web page creation more than girls do, whereas no other significant
   gender differences were noted regarding pupils' other Internet
   activities, such as communication via e-mail, chat or
   videoconferencing, Web surfing and information search for personal or

AB This paper is concerned with affective issues in learning technologies
   in a collaborative context. Traditionally in learning there has been a
   division between cognition and affect: where cognition is concerned
   with skills and processes such as thinking and problem-solving and
   affect with emotional areas such as motivation, attitudes, feelings.
   Affective issues have been viewed as somewhat problematic in studying
   learning, so although it is well known that learner attitude,
   motivation, and emotional state are very important, they have often
   been excluded from the frame of research, or studied separately from
   cognitive learning. This position is gradually changing and this paper
   considers what previous research has been conducted in these areas. It
   discusses the role of affective factors in three main areas of
   collaboration: in settings where learners are co-located, in on-line
   communities and to support and develop socio-emotional skills. It
   considers relevant developments in these areas, what the outcomes have
   been and suggests important directions for future research. (C) 2004

ID NOTE-TAKING; ACHIEVEMENT GOALS; CONSEQUENCES
AB Note taking and note reviewing are essential college student learning
   activities. A large number of carefully controlled studies have
   evaluated student effectiveness in implementing each of these skills
   and have found that both can be improved by providing instructor notes.
   While the Internet now offers a practical method for providing notes,
   some instructors are reluctant to offer notes because they fear that
   students will use these notes as an alternative to class attendance.
   This study used data collected by the server and questionnaires to
   describe voluntary use of online lecture notes, to search for
   correlates of individual patterns of note use, and to investigate
   student use of notes as an alternative to class attendance. Students
   primarily printed notes and used these notes during class
   presentations. There was some evidence that note users performed better
   on examinations than students who did not use notes. Some students did
   admit to using notes as an alternative to class attendance, but
   a,comparison between the examination scores of those who admitted to
   this practice and those who claimed never to use notes for this purpose
   showed no significant differences in performance. (C) 2004 Elsevier

AB VisSearch is a collaborative Web searching environment intended for
   sharing Web search results among people with similar interests, such as
   college students taking the same course. It facilitates students' Web
   searches by visualizing various Web searching processes. It also
   collects the visualized Web search results and applies an association
   rule data mining algorithm to find meaningful patterns in the Web
   search queries and the resulting useful Web resources. The mined
   patterns are then used as recommendations in guiding other students as
   they search the Web on the same or similar topics. This paper describes
   the design and implementation of the VisSearch environment and its
   evaluation. The experimental results showed that students who used the
   VisSearch environment were able to better search the Web than students
   who used the conventional Web search engines and Web browsers by
   utilizing the visualized Web searching processes and the recommended
   information. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the influence of cognitive style, spatial
   orientation and computer expertise on hypertext navigation pattern's
   and learning outcomes when participants interacted with a hypermedia
   presentation. A sample of 306 undergraduates was pre-tested both on
   their cognitive style and on their self-reported frequency and ability
   in using computers. From the initial sample, 40 students were selected
   to form four groups with the following characteristics: (a) 10 high
   computer users - sequential thinkers, (b) 10 high computer users.
   holistic thinkers, (c) 10 low computer users - sequential thinkers and
   (d) 10 low computer users - holistic thinkers. All participants
   completed a self-report questionnaire measuring spatial orientation and
   were then requested to browse freely a hypermedia presentation on the
   ancient Mayan civilisation. Finally, the students completed a post-test
   to assess the recall of the hypermedia presentation and the cognitive
   organisation of the acquired knowledge. The results indicated that
   hypermedia navigation behaviour was linked to computer,skills rather
   than to cognitive style and that learning outcomes were unaffected by
   cognitive style or by computer skills. However, learning outcomes were
   positively affected by specific search patterns, that is by re-visiting
   hypermedia sections and visiting overview sections in the early stages
   of hypermedia browsing. Further, navigating overview sections and
   holistic processing fostered knowledge representation in the form of
   maps. These findings suggest that individual differences can affect
   hypermedia navigation even though their role in learning is complex and
   the impact of cognitive style on learning outcomes was proved to be
   less important than initially predicted. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Two different technologies, groupware (a shared workspace) and shared
   wireless laptop computers, were implemented in a project design class
   in a civil engineering course. The research interest was in the way
   these technologies supported resource sharing within and across project
   groups and in the forms of group collaboration that resulted. The
   initiative was evaluated using both qualitative (e.g. pyramid
   discussion) and quantitative methods (e.g. survey, logs of usage). The
   results showed that these technologies helped improve group sharing of
   resources and supported different kinds of group collaboration. The
   shared workspace provided a location-independent central repository of
   resources around which group activities were coordinated whereas the
   laptops provided a focal point for the face-to-face discussion of these
   resources. The paper discusses the importance of embedding supportive
   technologies and the different forms of learner collaboration mediated
   by each technology. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The development of new communication technologies and their
   applications has opened a broad spectrum of options to promote
   learning, of which a significant one is CMC - Computer-Mediated
   Communication. Yet, students use this medium to a relatively small
   extent. Our premise is that the use of these technologies depends on
   the level of skills and expertise of the individuals using them. The
   purpose of this study is to determine whether taking a Computer
   Literacy and Applications course (CLA) before taking CMC courses has an
   impact on students' participation in CMC courses and on the effective
   use of various CIVIC tools. The sample consisted of 153 students
   enrolled in CMC courses in the Social Sciences in the Spring 2001/2 and
   Fall 2002/3 semesters. Participants were divided into two groups: 80
   students who had taken CLA, and 73 students who had not. A
   questionnaire to assess the impact of CLA on participation in CMC
   courses was administered to the two groups. The results of the study
   indicate that participation in CMC courses is more intensive in the
   group that had taken CLA. Based on these findings, we recommend
   mandating a CLA course, like the one developed at the Open University
   of Israel (OUI), before taking CMC courses. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

TI Emotional issues in teaching science: A case study of a teacher's views
SO RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE classroom emotional tone; science teaching; self-esteem; shame; social
   constructionist; theory of emotion; teacher emotion
AB Science teaching environments are social environments, and teachers'
   emotions interact with their science teaching in powerful ways. To
   value the teacher is to value the whole person, not just the intellect.
   In this paper, a theorization of teacher emotion in science teaching is
   developed which illustrates the role of emotion in establishing and
   maintaining self-esteem in science teaching situations. From the
   standpoint of social-constructionist theory of emotion. it is argued
   that emotion is a social construction within social relationships.
   Arising from this view, are the emotions of intellectual excitement,
   frustration and shame that play a key role in the development of
   self-esteem. The dynamics of these emotions, in the context of
   experiences of success and failure. may dispose teachers to act
   positively or negatively towards science teaching. The theorisation
   developed is illustrated in the emotional experiences of an elementary
   school teacher in an early childhood science classroom. These
   experiences indicate that emotion is constitutive of reaching, and
   merits greater consideration in science teaching.

   senior science
AB Agriculture, industry and medicine are being altered by new
   biotechnologies. Biotechnology education is important because today's
   students and, citizens will make decisions about the development and
   application of these new molecular biologies. This article reports an
   investigation of the teaching of biotechnology in an Australian state,
   New South Wales (NSW). In NSW few students were electing to answer
   examination questions related to biotechnology, suggesting that few
   students were studying the topic. This study looks at why electives
   relating to biotechnology are chosen or not chosen by students and
   teachers, with the intention of developing a greater understanding of
   the requirements for provision of a successful unit of study in this
   subject Data was obtained through a survey of secondary science
   teachers, interviews with teachers and two case studies of the teaching
   of a biotechnology unit. Teachers reported a range of obstacles to the
   teaching of biotechnology including the difficulty of the subject
   matter and a lack of practical work that was suited to the content of
   the teaching unit. If biotechnology is worth learning in school
   science. then further research is needed to identify ways to promote
   the effective teaching of this topic. which teachers regard as
   important for, and interesting to, students but which most teachers
   choose not to teach.

AB We report on two studies in which high school students who had been
   exposed to a cognitive training procedure known as the Conceptual
   Mediation Program (CMP) were compared to students who had not
   participated within the program. In the first study. based on data from
   two sites, it was found that 70 CMP students exhibited higher levels of
   school affect and strategy awareness than 103 comparable students not
   in the program. In the second study, based on retrospective data from
   one site, 53 students who had participated within CMP classes were
   found to exhibit higher levels of attainment on Year 12 South
   Australian public examination results (effect size of 1.04 on the
   aggregate). On the Year 12 examination results, the CMP students
   outperformed both the school and state norms.

AB This paper focuses on the use of multimedia-based
   predict-observe-explain (POE) tasks to facilitate small group learning
   conversations. Although the tasks were given to pairs of students as a
   diagnostic tool to elicit their pre-instructional physics conceptions,
   they also provided a peer learning opportunity for students. The study
   adopted a social constructivist perspective to analyse and interpret
   the. student's conversations, focussing on students' articulation and
   justification of their own science, conceptions, clarification of and
   critical reflection on their partners' views, and negotiation of new,
   shared meanings. Two senior science classes participated in this
   interpretive study. Data sources were mainly qualitative and included
   audio and video recordings of students' small group discussions at the
   computer, interviews with selected students and their teachers,
   classroom observations, and student surveys. Findings indicate that the
   computer-based POE tasks supported students' peer learning
   conversations, particularly during the prediction, reasoning and
   observation stages of the POE strategy. The increased level of student
   control of the POE tasks, combined with the multimedia nature of the
   program, initiated quality peer discussions. The findings have
   implications for authentic, technology-mediated learning in science.

AB This study reports on teaching practices in science classrooms of
   Indonesian lower secondary schools in rural areas. Using six schools
   from three districts in the province of Kalimantan Selatan as the
   sample, this study found that most teaching practices in science
   classrooms in rural schools were teacher-centred with students copying
   notes. However, the study also found unique teaching practices of an
   exemplary science teacher whose teaching style can be described as both
   student-centred and teacher-centred, with students encouraged to be
   active learners. Four features of exemplary teaching practices were
   identified: The teacher managed the classroom effectively: used a
   variety of questioning techniques: employed various teaching approaches
   instead of traditional methods: and created a favourable learning
   environment. Data from classroom observations. interviews with
   teachers, and students' responses to a questionnaire were used to
   compare the exemplary teacher and his colleagues. This study identified
   internal factors that may affect teaching practices such as a teacher's
   content knowledge and beliefs about teaching. Compared to the other
   teachers, the exemplary teacher possessed more content knowledge and
   had a relatively stronger belief in his ability to teach.

AB This paper is about a study into the nature of analogies recorded from
   three Form 2 (Grade 10) classes in Kenya, instructed by three physics
   teachers. Through a case study method involving classroom observation,
   several analogies were recorded and analysed. These analogies were
   predominantly environmental (drawn from students' socio-cultural
   environment) and anthropomorphic (life and human characteristics
   ascribed to analogues involving familiar concept,). A small number were
   scientific (those in which analogues are drawn from the science
   knowledge domain)-ones the author. for pedagogical reasons, wishes to
   see exploited. In addition, targets (concepts to be explained) were not
   freed from analogues (concepts used to explain), which is problematic.
   Also recorded were instances of students making statements that
   contained counter-physics messages. These included statements conveying
   literal understanding of technical terminology, sense experience
   understanding, which proved very robust, and obvious transfer of error
   from a particular knowledge domain to another. Caution is therefore
   advised to ensure that before developing and deploying analogies.
   students' understanding of the analogues must be sought. This most
   likely will reveal problems in their understanding and should be
   rectified before applying its meaning to the target.

ID PARTICULATE NATURE; CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; MATTER
AB This study examines the nature and process of ninth grade students'
   conceptual change regarding their mental model of dissolution and
   diffusion as a result of instructions using the Dual Situated Learning
   Model (DSLM). The dual situated learning events of this model are
   designed according to the students' ontological viewpoint of the
   science concepts as well as the nature of these cancepts. Moreover,
   these events serve two functions by creating dissonance with the
   pre-existing knowledge and providing new schema for constructing a more
   scientific view of the concept. The concepts of dissolution and
   diffusion were chosen to examine students' conceptual change process
   bemuse they involve the understanding of both invisible and process
   attributes. Results indicate that about 76%-90% of the students
   successfully underwent a change in their understanding of the cones of
   dissolution and diffusion after instruction using dual situated
   learning events. Moreover, about 75%, of the students successfully
   applied their previous mental sets into the challenging situated
   learning event. This current study demonstrates that DSLM indeed
   facilitates the processes of conceptual change and knowledge
   acquisition involving concepts of dissolution and diffusion, clarifying
   the nature of conceptual change involving science concepts of both an
   invisible and a process nature.

   way to systematically and reliably bring the needs of the business
   community and the resources of the academic community together.
   Responding to this need, a Web site was developed to promote linking
   students with real business problems. It has helped identify projects
   in various functional areas that aided businesses and enhanced student

TI Translating constructivism into instructional design: Potential and
   limitations
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE instructional design; constructivism; authentic learning; active
   learning; multiple perspectives; collaborative learning
AB Instructional designers are expected to be familiar with the
   epistemological underpinnings of several theories and their
   consequences on the process of instruction. Constructivism is the
   dominant theory of the last decade and supports construction of
   knowledge by the individual. This paper discusses the basic principles
   underlying constructivism, particularly active, collaborative and
   authentic learning. Application of these principles on the process -
   analysis, development, evaluation - of instructional design poses
   certain challenges with regards to issues such as pre-specification of
   knowledge, authentic evaluation and learner control. Most of the
   problems are attributed to the fact that constructivism is a learning
   theory and not an instructional-design theory. Therefore, instructional
   designers must attempt to translate constructivism into instructional
   design through a more pragmatic approach that focuses on the principles
   of moderate - rather than extreme - constructivism and makes use of
   emergent technology tools. This shift could facilitate the development
   of more situated, experiential, meaningful and cost-effective learning
   environments.

   paradigm": in order to avoid apathetic and indifferent consumption of
   technology-based commodities, users of technological devices should be
   given the opportunity to develop substantial involvement with the
   technological devices. While extending this idea to educational
   technologies, we present an explanatory model for the mediating role of
   technological artefacts. In conclusion, we explain how to approach
   technology-based innovations in education by arguing for transparent
   and interactive devices, for products as carriers of meaning, for
   values that harmonise with the characteristics of man and for a mixed
   mode of developing new ideas and preserving former achievements.

AB The purpose of this study was to describe how four teachers in four
   different cities in Missouri implemented a constructivist-based
   learning environment (CBLE) that included an innovation cluster that
   paired an emerging online technology with a unit design framework. The
   motivating question for the study originated from prior research on
   teacher reform efforts including the adoption of technology innovations
   in the classroom, new theories of constructivist- based learning and
   the principles of professional development for educators implementing
   reform. Using a multiple case study research method, the researchers
   collected and analyzed data to ( 1) identify how effectively each of
   the teachers implemented the CBLE unit based on their goals for
   adopting the innovations while participating in online collaborative
   professional development and ( 2) identify cross-case issues that arose
   as the teachers implemented the unit. Conclusions in the study suggest
   that the teachers implemented innovation into their classrooms with
   varied levels of effectiveness based on their initial goals for the
   reform process. Aspects that influenced the effectiveness of their unit
   and the implementation of the innovation included ( 1) the teacher's
   ability to benefit from online collaborative professional development
   forums, ( 2) the teacher's problem-solving strategies for resolving
   conflict issues related to their local school environment, and ( 3)
   their prior conceptions about teaching and learning and their
   compatibility with the reform instructional pedagogy.

AB This study investigated the relationship between student perceptions of
   others in an online class and both affective and cognitive learning
   outcomes. Data were gathered from student survey responses and
   instructor evaluation of performance. Results from this study indicated
   significant correlations between student perceptions of the presence of
   other students in the class and scores on an attitudes scale and their
   satisfaction with their own learning. This finding demonstrates the
   salience of other students in the learning environment to affective
   learning outcomes. Perceptions of the instructor's presence were
   significantly correlated with both affective learning and with student
   learning satisfaction. This outcome in an online class is consistent
   with findings on teacher immediacy literature in traditional classes
   and highlight the role of the teacher in establishing a learning
   environment. Results relative to cognitive learning showed that student
   reports of their perception of their own presence in the class were
   significantly correlated with performance in the class and with the
   grade they would assign themselves.

SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY

DT Article
DE digital divide; Rawls; inequalities; funding; educational technology
AB There are more than 700 million current Internet users, but the world
   population is approximately 6 billion ( Trend 2001), indicating that
   computer technology is used by less than one-eighth of the population.
   Computers are becoming common tools in schools, often viewed as a
   democratic panacea despite the costs involved and despite the fact that
   the majority does not have access to computers and/or the Internet;
   this creates a digital divide for students, in which some are "more
   equal" than others. Educators, thinking they have solved the digital
   divide issue, create a placebo effect because most do not consider
   students' issues of transportation to the library, lack of funds for a
   home computer, or the time it takes to navigate an available public
   computer and Internet connection. In this paper, the author argues that
   Rawls' theory of justice does not work in practice with regard to
   technology, or as a way to solve the digital divide and the
   inequalities in school funding. She argues that another ethical theory
   should guide technological funding and policies in schools, embracing
   theories by Levinas, Noddings, Davis, Freire, Nkrumah, and Buber, in
   order to open scholarly discussion on the issues of injustice and
   technological funding inequities.

DE designer support; online collaboration and knowledge construction;
   facilitation of online communication
ID CONCEPT MAP; SCIENCE; DISCOURSE; STUDENTS; CONTEXT; TOOL
AB Designer support is critical for facilitating collaboration and
   knowledge construction in an online learning environment. Designer
   support in this paper refers to the mechanisms that a designer builds
   in a technology-mediated environment to facilitate online learning.
   This paper focuses on two aspects of designer support: 1) creating a
   shared context, and 2) facilitating online communication and knowledge
   construction. Examples of these two aspects of support are presented
   along a continuum ranging from technology that simply allows
   collaboration to collaborative technology that makes collaboration more
   accessible to users. Examples of strategies for creating a shared
   context include the use of metaphorical designs to graphically
   represent the virtual environment for intuitive navigation and role
   transplantation, the use of informational support for decision-making,
   and the use of multiple information channels and tools to support
   coordinated collaboration in task-based projects. In order to
   facilitate online communication and knowledge construction, on the
   other hand, designers can employ communication scaffolds to structure
   online communication and artifacts as shared representations that
   provide contexts for online discussions. Finally, the potential
   application of similar mechanisms to online course management systems
   is discussed.

   representation
AB Computer science provides with virtual laboratories, places where one
   can merge real experiments with the formalism of algorithms and
   mathematics and where, with the advent of multimedia, sounds and movies
   can also be added. In this paper we present a method, based on
   principles of formal ontology, allowing one to develop interactive
   educational tools. The structure of our system starts from general
   considerations on knowledge itself moving on to formal ontological
   principles in order to obtain a robust knowledge frame and good
   awareness of knowledge levels involved during the teaching process. Our
   system is split into object-knowledge - the knowledge of the phenomenon
   to be taught - and meta-knowledge - i.e., how to teach it. Using a trip
   ( journey) metaphor, together with the flexibility of semantic graph
   representations, we define the reference frame and we apply it to a
   case study related to the Planetary Missions, the subject of our
   research. This tool is provided with a multimedia interface to show the
   results of several current missions, but may be implemented with new
   missions.

AB Much has been said about the benefits of the Internet as a teaching and
   learning tool but to realize these benefits, teachers must be willing
   and able to use the Internet effectively in their teaching. Studies
   have also clearly shown that the likeliness of teachers using the
   Internet effectively and the success of Internet utilization was very
   much related to the users' attitudes toward the Internet (Liaw, 2002;
   Moon Kim, 2001; Johnson & Hignite, 2000). This paper describes a study
   on pre-service teachers with differing levels of Internet experience,
   at one of the premier universities in Malaysia, to assess their
   Internet use and attitudes toward the Internet. The study is
   exploratory in essence and seeks to ascertain the comfort level of
   pre-service teachers where the Internet is concerned and hence to
   provide a glimpse of the future of the Internet in education within the
   Malaysian context.

TI Using information and communication technology in secondary schools in
   Nigeria: Problems and prospects

   learning environment; Internet gateway; Nigeria's telecommunication
AB Though it has been rightly said that what is wrong with education
   cannot be fixed with technology; there is no doubt that modern life is
   dominated by technology. There is universal recognition of the need to
   use Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in education as we
   enter the era of globalization where the free flow of information via
   satellite and the internet hold sway in global information
   dissemination of knowledge. Already, Nigeria is on he wrong side of the
   international digital divide, as it has not made significant effort to
   integrate ICT into secondary school curriculum. A great deal of
   instructional and administrative work in secondary school in Nigeria is
   still carried out manually. This paper, therefore, examines the major
   obstacles militating against the use of ICT in secondary education in
   Nigeria. It identifies he high cost of computer hardware and software;
   weak infrastructure; lack of human skills and knowledge in ICT, and
   lack of relevant software appropriate and culturally suitable to
   Nigeria as the major stumbling block o the adoption of ICT in secondary
   education in Nigeria. Also, secondary schools in Nigeria are not given
   adequate funds to provide furniture, relevant textbooks and adequate
   classroom let alone being given adequate fund for high-tech equipment.
   At present the cost of subscribing to the Internet is too high for many
   of the impoverished secondary schools in Nigeria. In modern society,
   Nigeria needs ICT to aid teaching and learning and educational
   management. ICT is an instrument for the economic and technological
   development in the 21(st) century; therefore, Nigeria cannot afford to
   be on the wrong side of the digital divide.

AB The purpose of the study was to investigate the impact of an
   experimental online learning tool on student performance. By applying
   cognitive load theory to online learning, the experimental tool used
   was designed to minimize cognitive load during the instructional and
   learning process. This tool enabled students to work with programming
   code that was supplemented with instructor descriptions and feedback,
   embedded directly within the code while maintaining the original
   integrity of the coding environment. A sample of 24 online graduate
   students at a southeastern university were randomly assigned to four
   groups: Group 1 ( Control group), Group 2 ( Assessment group: the tool
   was used to provide feedback on student work), Group 3 ( Lecture group:
   the tool was used to describe examples of code provided in lectures),
   and Group 4 ( Total tool group: the tool was used to provide feedback
   on student work as well as describe examples of code in lectures).
   Student learning was measured via analysis of six online quizzes. While
   provision of tool-facilitated feedback alone did not appear to enhance
   student learning, the results indicate that students performed best
   when they had the opportunity to view examples of code facilitated by
   the tool during the learning process of new material. This implies a
   carefully designed online learning environment, especially while
   controlling for and minimizing cognitive load when presenting new
   information, can enhance that student learning.

AB During the 1990s, all Spanish Universities updated the syllabuses of
   their courses as a result of the entry into force of the new Organic
   Law of Universities (Ley Organica de Universidades) and, for the first
   time, Computer Assisted Design (CAD) appears in the list of core
   subjects (compulsory teaching content set by the government) in many of
   the technical degree courses. The law opens the door to a new type of
   "elective'' subjects, which are proposed by the Schools or Faculties,
   and many of which are directly related to CAD. Since then, each teacher
   has used different methodologies and tools for teaching CAD. It is very
   interesting - and this was the comment of all the teachers who
   participated in the study we earned out - to collect all the
   information and most relevant opinions from all the teachers who have
   been teaching CAD since the law came into force. We proposed a
   questionnaire, which was sent to over 600 teachers. seeking information
   about the subject (name and if it was entirely dedicated to CAD) the
   practice group (number of students. classroom "ownership"), the
   duration (the time dedicated to the practical classes last and the
   desirable duration), the CAD program used (name,. updates. if they
   would change it for a teaching oriented program, and whether parametric
   programs are used) and system of evaluation (how a student is evaluated
   and how they think students should be-evaluated) in order to discover
   the present state of CAD teaching. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We developed a hybrid course format (part online, part face-to-face) to
   deliver a high-enrollment, introductory environmental biology course to
   resident (living on or near campus), non-science majors at a large,
   public university. The hybrid course was structured to include
   bi-weekly online assignments and weekly meetings in the lecture hall
   focused on active-learning, exercises. To evaluate the effectiveness of
   the web-based component of the hybrid course, we taught the hybrid
   course simultaneously with a traditional course in which we used
   passive lectures to cover material in the online assignments. Both
   courses received the same active-learning activities in class. Students
   in the hybrid course reported that the quality of interaction with the
   instructor was high, that they read the text more often and studied in
   groups more frequently. Performance on a post-course assessment test
   indicated that the hybrid course format was better or equivalent to the
   traditional course. Specifically, online assignments were equivalent to
   or better than passive lectures, and that active-learning exercises
   were more effective when coupled with online activities. Performance
   gains were greater for upperclassmen than for freshmen, indicating that
   hybrid course formats might be a superior option for upperclassmen when
   satisfying general science requirements. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Personalized service is important on the Internet, especially in
   Web-based learning. Generally, most personalized systems consider
   learner preferences, interests, and browsing behaviors in providing
   personalized services. However, learner ability usually is neglected as
   an important factor in implementing personalization. mechanisms.
   Besides, too many hyperlink structures in Web-based learning systems
   place a large information burden on learners. Consequently in Web-based
   learning disorientation (losing in hyperspace), cognitive overload,
   lack of an adaptive mechanism. and information overload are the main
   research issues. This study proposes a personalized e-learning system
   based on Item Response Theory, (PEL-IRT) which considers both course
   material difficulty and learner ability to provide individual learning
   paths for learners. The item characteristic function proposed by Rasch
   with a single difficulty parameter is used to model the course
   materials. To obtain more precise estimation of learner ability the
   maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is applied to estimate learner
   ability based on explicit learner feedback. Moreover, to determine an
   appropriate level of difficulty parameter for the course materials,
   this study also proposes a collaborative voting approach for adjusting
   course material difficulty. Experiment result's show that applying Item
   Response Theory (IRT) to Web-based learning can achieve personalized
   learning and help learners to learn more effectively and efficiently.

ID PATTERNS
AB In a classroom, a teacher attempts to convey his or her knowledge to
   the students. and thus it is important for the teacher to obtain
   formative feedback about how well students are understanding the new
   material. By gaining insight into the students' understanding and
   possible misconceptions. the teacher will be able to adjust the
   teaching and to supply more useful learning materials as necessary.
   Therefore. the diagnosis of formative student evaluations is critical
   for teachers and learners, as is the diagnosis of patterns in the
   overall learning by a class in order to inform a teacher about the
   efficacy of his or her teaching. This paper investigates what might be
   called the "class learning diagnosis problem" by embedding important
   concepts in a test and analyzing the results with a hierarchical coding
   scheme. Based on previous research. the part-of and type-of
   relationships among concepts are used to construct a concept hierarchy
   that may then be coded hierarchically. All concepts embedded in the
   test items then can be formulated into concept matrices, and the answer
   sheets of the learners in a class are then analyzed to indicate
   particular types of concept errors. The trajectories of concept errors
   are studied to identify both individual misconceptions students might
   have as well as patterns of misunderstanding in the overall class. In
   particular, a clustering algorithm is employed to distinguish student
   groups who might share similar misconceptions. These approaches are
   implemented as an integrated module in a previously developed system
   and applied to two real classroom data sets, the results of which show
   the practicability of this proposed method. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB This study investigated gender differences for college computer science
   majors in Taiwan. Subjects were college students enrolled in five
   universities offering computer science programs. A total of 940 valid
   questionnaires were collected, including 796 males (85%) and 144,
   females (15%). Significant gender differences were not found for most
   of the College Entrance Examination (CEE) scores: prior computer
   experience and the prediction models of college performance. However,
   female students achieved significantly higher scores in CEE language
   component. Females were also found to outperform males in academic
   achievement at both the high school and college levels. including math
   courses. The results seem to suggest that, in Taiwan, female students
   who decided to enroll in the computer science programs might be more
   confident in their ability to compete with males In this male-dominated
   field. due to appropriate amount of math discipline and computer
   experience they gained prior to entering college. (C) 2004 Elsevier

AB Within the university the introduction of computers is creating a new
   criterion of differentiation between those who as a matter of course
   become integrated in the technocratic trend deriving from the daily use
   of these machines and those who become isolated by not using them. This
   difference increases when computer science and communications merge to
   introduce virtual educational areas. where the conjunction of teacher
   and pupil in the space-time dimension is no longer an essential
   requirement. and where the written text Is replaced (or rather
   complemented) by the digital text.
   In this article, a historical defence is made of the presence of this
   new standard in the creation of digital educational resources such as
   the hyperdocument, as well as the barriers and technological problems
   deriving from its use. Furthermore, HyCo, an authoring tool, is
   introduced which facilitates the composition of hypertexts, which are
   stored as semantic learning objects, looking for that through of a
   simple and extremely intuitive interface and interaction model. any
   teacher with a minimum knowledge of computer science has the
   possibility of transforming his or her experience and knowledge into
   useful and quality hypermedia educational resources. (C) 2004 Elsevier

AB In powerful learning environments, rich contexts and authentic tasks
   are presented to pupils. Active. autonomous and co-operative learning
   is stimulated, and the curriculum is adapted to the needs and
   capabilities of individual pupils. In this study, the characteristics
   of learning environments and the contribution of ICT to learning
   environments were investigated. A questionnaire was completed by 331
   teachers in the highest grade of primary education. Results show that
   many teachers apply several elements of powerful learning environments
   in their classes. This especially goes for the presentation of
   authentic tasks and the fostering of active and autonomous learning.
   However, the methods employed by teachers to adapt education to the
   needs and abilities of individual pupils proved quite limited. The use
   of ICT in general merely showed characteristics of traditional
   approaches to learning. Chances of using open-ended ICT applications,
   which are expected to contribute to the power of learning environments.
   were greater with teachers who created powerful learning environments
   for their pupils, and when there were more computers available to
   pupils. In addition, teachers' views with regard to the contribution of
   ICT to active and autonomous learning.. teachers' skills in using ICT,
   and the teacher's gender appeared to be relevant back-ground variables
   in this respect. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT
AB The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a Local
   Systemic Change (LSC) initiative (N = 216) at Year 2 in a 5-year plan.
   Key questions were: What is the extent of school and teacher
   involvement?; What is the impact on teacher preparedness, attitudes,
   and beliefs?; and What is the extent of institutionalization? The model
   of professional development used shared leadership (Lead Teachers &
   Study Groups) along with workshops in inquiry, content, and assessment.
   All teachers averaged 81 hours of participation by the end of Year 2;
   LTs averaged 161 hours. Longitudinal and episodic data were collected
   using multiple instruments, including Horizon Research Teacher Survey
   (Baseline and Year 2), SG and Lead Teacher surveys (Year 1 and Year 2),
   Context Beliefs About Teaching Science and Classroom Observation
   Protocol (Year 2). Gains in teachers' practices, beliefs, and
   professional culture (collegiality and department chair support) were
   measured at significance levels of .05. The results indicate that
   sustained and intensive professional development influences individuals
   and school culture. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In this investigation we employed a case study approach with
   qualitative and quantitative data sources to examine and discover the
   characteristics of the processes used by a midwestern U.S. school
   system to adopt and implement a new K-6 science curriculum. Analysis of
   data yielded several results. Elementary teachers received what they
   requested, a hands-on science program with texts and kits. Teachers as
   a group remained in the early stages of the Concerns-Based Adoption
   Model profile of concerns. Many K-6 teachers remained uncomfortable
   with teaching science. Teachers' attitudes regarding the new program
   were positive, and they taught more science. Teachers struggled with
   science-as-inquiry, with a science program they believe contained too
   many concepts and too much vocabulary, and with their beliefs that
   students learned more and loved the new hands-on program. Traditional
   science teaching remained the norm. Administrative support was positive
   but insufficient to facilitate full implementation of the new program
   and more substantial change in teaching. Standardized science
   achievement test scores did not show an observable pattern of growth.
   It is concluded that a systematic, ongoing program of professional
   development is necessary to address teachers' concerns and help the
   district realize its goal of standards-based K-6 science instruction.

AB This article reports on attitude changes of 300 children, aged 10 or 11
   years, from four schools, who visited the UK National Space Centre.
   Attitudes toward science and space were explored by examining responses
   to five different attitude scales. These were administered before,
   immediately after, and 2 months and 4-5 months after a visit to the
   main exhibition area and Challenger Centre. Observations during the
   visits and interviews of teachers and a sample of children were carried
   out. Before the visit girls were more anxious than boys. Immediately
   afterward, children showed more interest in space and a moderate
   increase in their views about the value of science in society. Nearly
   20% of the pupils showed an increased desire to become scientists in
   the future. These children also showed a positive advantage over the
   other children with regard to science enthusiasm and space interest.
   Two months later, they continued to be more positive about being future
   scientists but only the girls' scores were still significantly raised.
   Most children found the Challenger experience positive but had more
   problems with the exhibition area. Teachers' preparation and support
   during the visit as well as their personal interest had a significant
   longterm effect on children's attitudes. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals,

AB The purpose of this study is to contribute to a theoretical knowledge
   base through research by examining factors salient to science education
   reform and practice in the context of socioscientific issues. The study
   explores how individuals negotiate and resolve genetic engineering
   dilemmas. A qualitative approach was used to examine patterns of
   informal reasoning and the role of morality in these processes. Thirty
   college students participated individually in two semistructured
   interviews designed to explore their informal reasoning in response to
   six genetic engineering scenarios. Students demonstrated evidence of
   rationalistic, emotive, and intuitive forms of informal reasoning.
   Rationalistic informal reasoning described reason-based considerations;
   emotive informal reasoning described care-based considerations; and
   intuitive reasoning described considerations based on immediate
   reactions to the context of a scenario. Participants frequently relied
   on combinations of these reasoning patterns as they worked to resolve
   individual socioscientific scenarios. Most of the participants
   appreciated at least some of the moral implications of their decisions,
   and these considerations were typically interwoven within an overall
   pattern of informal reasoning. These results highlight the need to
   ensure that science classrooms are environments in which intuition and
   emotion in addition to reason are valued. Implications and
   recommendations for future research are discussed. (C) 2004 Wiley

ID LEARNING-STRATEGIES
AB Little is known about how successful students in Web-based courses
   self-regulate their learning. This descriptive case study used a social
   cognitive model of self-regulated learning (SRL) to investigate how six
   graduate students used and adapted traditional SRL strategies to
   complete tasks and cope with challenges in a Web-based technology
   course; it also explored motivational and environmental influences on
   strategy use. Primary data sources were three transcribed interviews
   with each of the students over the course of the semester, a
   transcribed interview with the course instructor, and the students'
   reflective journals. Archived course documents, including transcripts
   of threaded discussions and student Web pages, were secondary data
   sources. Content analysis of the data indicated that these students
   used many traditional SRL strategies, but they also adapted planning,
   organization, environmental structuring, help seeking, monitoring,
   record keeping, and self-reflection strategies in ways that were unique
   to the Web-based learning environment. The data also suggested that
   important motivational influences on SRL strategy use-self-efficacy,
   goal orientation, interest, and attributions-were shaped largely by
   student successes in managing the technical and social environment of
   the course. Important environmental influences on SRL strategy use
   included instructor support, peer support, and course design.
   Implications for online course instructors and designers, and
   suggestions for future research are offered.

AB Sixty-five undergraduates were classified into
   field-dependent,field-mixed, and field-independent learners, and were
   randomly assigned to two groups: text-only and text-and-visual.
   Participants in the text-only group received a description of a model
   in textual format, whereas participants in the other group received the
   same description in textual-and-visual format. Participants were then
   asked to individually explore a computer model, test hypotheses, and
   solve a problem related to immigration policies. Their problem-solving
   performance was analyzed using a 3 x 2 analysis of variance (ANOVA).
   Results showed that the text-and-visual group outperformed the
   text-only group, that performance was signicantly related to
   field-dependence-independence, and that there was a significant
   interaction effect. Specifically,field-independent learners in the
   text-and-visual group outperformed field-dependent and field-mixed
   learners in both groups, and field-independent learners in the
   text-only group. The findings indicate that adding visuals to textual
   explanations can enhance understanding, and that the functional role of
   visuals depends on cognitive differences.

DT Article
AB Business needs in many corporations call for learning outcomes that
   involve problem solutions, and creating and sharing new knowledge
   within workplace situations that may involve collaboration among
   members of a team. We argue that work-based activities (WBA) and
   computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) are appropriate
   components for courses in such learning situations. Via this approach,
   collaborative work situations become the core of a course. We further
   describe how activity theory can provide a framework for the design of
   courses that involve WBA and CSCL as part of a workplace-oriented
   activity system for learning. The use of this design approach for
   courses offered by the Learning and Leadership Development organization
   of Shell International Exploration and Production is described and an
   example is elaborated. Finally, we identify main issues and challenges
   that arose during the use of the design approach.

AB Although important, traditional basic-to-applied research methods have
   provided an insufficient basis for advancing the design and
   implementation of innovative collaborative learning environments. It is
   proposed that more progress may be accomplished through development
   research or design research. Development research protocols require
   intensive and long-term collaboration among researchers and
   practitioners. In this article, we propose guidelines for implementing
   development research models more widely, and conclude with a
   prescription for an online collaborative learning research agenda for
   the next five to ten years.

TI Turning electronic learning environments into useful and influential
   'instructional design anchor points'
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Instructional design may help make educational research more useful and
   influential. In this discussion, I argue that instructional design
   anchor points (IDAPs) are the basis for this kind of research. In
   short, IDAPs are educational tools or approaches that can be studied to
   generate design guidelines. The study of IDAPs may become more useful
   and more influential when it meets at least the following four
   conditions: (a) a clear description of the IDAP under study, (b)
   Presence of a clear conceptual framework; (c) a deliberate
   consideration of complexity; and (d) a realistic perspective on
   improvement and implementation. This two-part special issue of
   Educational Technology Research and Development, on electronic learning
   environments, illustrates the possibilities and pitfalls of studying
   IDAPs.
   In this contribution, the four conditions are illustrated by referring
   to the main articles of the special issue. Indeed, it is argued that
   electronic environments are the most recent version of an IDAP. The
   discussion highlights the need for a clear description of the IDAP
   electronic learning environment, the elaboration of a layered
   conceptual framework, a more systematic consideration of limitations,
   and a good balance between realism and voluntarism.

AB The contributions to this issue share a focus on design of e-learning
   environments. Instructional designers stand at very early stages of
   knowledge in this area, but with great potential for growth and
   progress. This commentary offers an activity-based perspective on
   e-learning environments, resulting in a flexible stance toward
   instructional strategies, artifact design, emergent activity, and
   learning outcomes. This same flexibility should be evident as we in the
   field appropriate theories from other disciplines and develop some of
   our own. I support the contributors' call for more design research
   specifically addressing challenging problems of practice encountered by
   design practitioners.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This study examined the impact of structuredness of asynchronous online
   discussion protocols and evaluation rubrics on meaningful discourse.
   Transcripts of twelve online discussions involving 87 participants from
   four sections of a graduate course entitled Instructional Technology
   Foundations and Learning Theory were analysed across four semesters.
   Protocols and evaluation rubrics guiding online discussions in this
   course ranged from minimal structure or loosely defined protocols in
   the first section, to high sructure or well defined and comprehensive
   protocols and evaluation criteria in the fourth section. The analyses
   revealed that some elements of structure had a significant impact on
   meaningful discourse. Particularly, guidelines that assisted the
   facilitation and evaluation of online discussions increased the
   cognitive quality of student postings promoting a deeper and more
   meaningful understanding of course content.

TI When group work leaves the classroom does group skills development also
   go out the window?
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In moving towards what Lemke (1996) terms the 'interactive learning
   paradigm', higher education has adopted two key principles consistent
   with group learning technologies:
   learning is always mediated by and occurs through language (Falk, 1997;
   Gee, 1997); and
   learning is distributed across a range of other people, sites, objects,
   technologies and time (Gee, 1997).
   A third and relatively recent principle to emerge on the higher
   education scene that seems to 'contradict' accepted views of group
   learning technologies is that:
   many universities now choose to offer 'learning resources' online.
   This paper asks whether Information and Communication Technologies
   (ICTs) are 'robust' enough to support, sustain and address industry,
   employer and government calls for greater attention to group skills
   development in university graduates. Data features an examination of
   respondent feedback (n = 171) in an 'ICT-rich' group work setting, and
   the subsequent ratings of group skills development over a 13-week
   period. This discussion offers an account of learner outcomes by
   adopting Kirkpatrick's (1996) four levels of evaluation of learning as
   a classification scheme for determining learner satisfaction (Level
   One), the effectiveness of learning transfer (Level Two), its impact on
   practice (Level Three) and the appropriation of learning behaviours by
   participants (Level Four). The contrasting patterns of ICT use between
   female and male users in the data are discussed in relation to building
   social presence and producing social categories online. Differences
   reported here indicate that ICT group work is moving forward, but
   opportunities to challenge rather than reproduce existing learning
   relations and differences, remain largely unresolved.

AB What is to be captured and how it is to be reused are issues that
   currently dominate a learning object discourse constructed around the
   potential for technology to enable learning resource management through
   the collection and reuse and learning objects. Efficiency and quality
   gains are promised for institutions that engage with the learning
   object economy. This account of the issues surrounding current
   conceptions of the reusability and reuse of learning resources
   questions whether object-based resource reuse can simultaneously
   achieve gains in both areas, and whether a learning object economy will
   sustain institutional development and diversity for those HEIs that

TI Identification of learning styles online by observing learners'
   browsing behaviour through a neural network
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID HYPERMEDIA
AB Identification of individual learning style is important when
   developing adaptive educational hypermedia systems. Current systems ask
   learners to complete questionnaires to identify their learning styles,
   which might not be appropriate in some contexts. The goal of this
   research is to identify the learner's learning style by simply
   observing his/her browsing behaviour without asking the learner to
   answer any questions or filling out any form. It is implemented through
   a multi-layer feed forward neural network (MLFF). Browsing behaviour,
   in this research, includes three factors, the use of embedded support
   devices (ESDs), the selection of link types, and the navigation between
   visited/unvisited nodes. The experiment results showed the proposed
   model performed well in identifying learning styles. Link type is the
   dominant factor and Time shift may not be a major factor in the
   identification of learning styles. Because of the fast execution
   property of neural networks and identification of learning styles
   online, it is possible to incorporate learning styles into online
   adaptive educational web-based systems.

TI Primary pupils' recall of interactive storybooks on CD-ROM:
   inconsiderate interactive features and forgetting
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CHILDREN
AB The use of interactive storybooks in the primary classroom has the
   potential to facilitate pupils' reading, in small groups or
   individually. However, critics have expressed concern at the exposure
   of pupils to interactive storybooks. In particular, concern has been
   expressed that the interactive animations and sound effects in such
   storybooks may adversely affect pupils' responses to the written text.
   These small scale studies examined whether story recall of small groups
   of pupils, respectively in Year 5 and Year 4, was affected by the
   provision of cued animations and sound effects. Consideration of the
   outcomes of both studies indicates that access to cued animations and
   sound effects did have adverse effects on pupils' story recall.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

ID COGNITION
AB Notions of competency have dominated the computer education literature,
   and have underpinned Competency-Based Training (CBT) in information
   technology at all levels of education and training. The emergence of
   counter-narratives underpinned by the capability movement, have as yet
   had minimal impact on practice in computer education. New discourses in
   educational theory and practice which are founded on non-linear
   approaches to learning and teaching provide added impetus to engage in
   the competency/capability debate, and re-examine our approaches to
   computer education. This paper explores complexity theories and
   demonstrates how complexity's pedagogical implications can lead to new
   models for understanding computer learning and teaching. A new model
   for conceptualising end-user computer education is presented that was
   derived from a three-year action research initiative with pre-service
   teachers.

ID CAUSAL-ANALYSIS
AB Students today comprise a very diverse group, and this will be
   reflected in their attitudes towards learning. This study set out to
   examine four different cohorts of UK students during the same time
   period. Contrary to expectations, it was found that attitudes towards
   books and computers, as measured by separate but matched scales, were
   equal, even though experience of the two media varied considerably. A
   key predictor for computer attitude was found to be confidence for
   learning from computers rather than general computer confidence.
   Further, attitudes and confidence towards books and computers as
   learning tools varied significantly across the four cohorts.

AB In My Fair Lady (Lerner & Lowe, 1956), the play, the renowned
   linguistics professor, Henry Higgins, attempts to instruct the common
   flower-vendor, Eliza Doolittle, in proper English etiquette and speech.
   Revisit the colourful story from the perspective of a twenty-first
   century instructional designer. Set in the 1910s, but written in the
   heyday of behaviourism, the play reflects the idea that behavioural
   change is the evidence of learning. As we analyse Professor Higgins's
   applied theory of learning and instruction, we find unique examples of
   behaviourism, cognitivism and constructivism at work in the
   instructional strategies and activities and in the good professor's
   interpretations of Ms Doolittle's actions and attitudes toward learning.

   CONSTRAINTS; STUDENTS
AB This paper introduces the four research papers in this paper set, which
   all derive from a European research project, STTIS (Science Teacher
   Training in an Information Society). The central concern of the project
   was to study curriculum innovations ill science, and to investigate
   ways in which teachers transform these innovations when putting them
   into practice. This work led to the construction of appropriate teacher
   training materials for use when an innovation is being introduced. The
   paper describes the mutual research strategy agreed upon by the STTIS
   partners. Both to avoid repetition and to underline the understanding
   that the partners share about the issues involved in curriculum
   innovation and related teacher education, the main theoretical
   background is to be found here. Themes and conclusions common to all
   the papers are highlighted. The paper also outlines the common features
   of the approach the STTIS partners took toward the construction of
   teacher training materials. These materials build in concrete results
   from the research, in forms that provoke discussion and reflection
   aimed at making teachers more aware of their ideas and behavior, with a
   view to effecting lasting change. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Designing strategies and tools for teacher training: The role of
   critical details, examples in optics
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Within the overall STTIS (Science Teacher Training in an Information
   Society) framework, this paper focuses on transformations of innovative
   teaching of optics, following a recommended change of approach to
   optics in the French curriculum. The empirical investigation of how
   teachers responded to this change, the main results of which are
   briefly presented here, identified a crucial aspect of the problem.
   This is the importance of "critical details": that is, the fact that
   the linkage between certain critical details of practice and the
   fundamental rationale of a teaching sequence is often not easily
   understood by teachers, even those who are strongly motivated. The
   paper then discusses the development of guidelines for the design of
   training materials based on these research findings, which show how
   teachers typically tend to transform innovations when putting them into
   practice. We describe the rationale behind and structure of some
   teacher training materials intended to facilitate awareness and mastery
   in this respect. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   Certain critical features, important for the successful and fruitful

   made use (or not) of these features. transforming the innovation in
   various ways.
   The research results were used to design a set of training materials

DT Article
AB This paper, from the UK group in the STTIS (Science Teacher Training in
   an Information Society) project, describes research into the nature of
   teachers' transformations of computer modeling, and the development of
   related teacher training materials. Eight teacher case studies help to
   identify factors that favor or hinder the take-up of innovative
   computer tools in science classes, and to show how teachers incorporate
   these tools in the curriculum. The training materials use the results
   to provide activities enabling teachers to learn about the tools and
   about the outcomes of the research into their implementation, and help
   them to take account of these ideas in their own implementation of the
   innovations. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study focused on informal reasoning regarding socioscientific
   issues. It sought to explore how content knowledge influenced the
   negotiation and resolution of contentious and complex scenarios based
   on genetic engineering. Two hundred and sixty-nine students drawn from
   undergraduate natural science and nonnatural science courses completed
   a quantitative test of genetics concepts. Two subsets (n = 15 for each
   group) of the original sample representing divergent levels of content
   knowledge participated in individual interviews, during which they
   articulated positions, rationales, counterpositions, and rebuttals in
   response to three gene therapy scenarios and three cloning scenarios. A
   mixed-methods approach was used to examine the effects of content
   knowledge on the use of informal reasoning patterns and the quality of
   informal reasoning. Participants from both groups employed the same
   general patterns of informal reasoning. Data did indicate that
   differences in content knowledge were related to variations in informal
   reasoning quality. Participants, with more advanced understandings of
   genetics, demonstrated fewer instances of reasoning flaws, as defined
   by a priori criteria, and were more likely to incorporate content
   knowledge in their reasoning patterns than participants with more naive
   understandings of genetics. Implications for instruction and future
   research are discussed. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This paper reports the results of applying a particular analytical
   perspective to data from an interview study: a typology of learning
   impediments informed by research into learning and students' ideas in
   science. This typology is a heuristic tool that may help diagnose the
   origins of students' learning difficulties. Here it is applied to data
   from students interviewed about a problematic curriculum topic-the
   "oribital" model of atomic and molecular structures. Several specific
   features of learners' developing ideas about atomic and molecular
   structures were identified in published reports of the study. In this
   paper, interview data is examined "through" the analytical lens of the
   typology to explore possible explanations for students' learning
   difficulties in the topic. It is suggested that the typology provides a
   useful perspective for exploring some aspects of students' learning
   difficulties, but that the previously published form of the typology
   could be modified to include important additional types of learning
   impediments. The heuristic value of the typology is demonstrated in
   terms of the way that the analysis can both inform teaching, and
   suggest a focus for further research. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Project-based learning (PBL), which is increasingly supported by
   information technologies (IT), contributes to fostering
   student-directed scientific inquiry of problems in a real-world
   setting. This study investigated the integration of PBL in an IT
   environment into three undergraduate chemistry courses, each including
   both experimental and control students. Students in the experimental
   group volunteered to carry out an individual IT-based project, whereas
   the control students solved only traditional problems. The project
   included constructing computerized molecular models, seeking
   information on scientific phenomena, and inquiring about chemistry
   theories. The effect of the PBL was examined both quantitatively and
   qualitatively. The quantitative analysis was based on a pretest, a
   posttest, and a final examination, which served for comparing the
   learning gains of the two research groups. For the qualitative
   analysis, we looked into the experimental students' performance, as
   reflected by the projects they had submitted. In addition, "think
   aloud" interviews and observations helped us gain insight into the
   students' conceptual understanding of molecular structures. Students
   who participated in the IT-enhanced PBL performed significantly better
   than their control classmates not only on their posttest but also on
   their course final examination. Analyzing the qualitative findings, we
   concluded that the construction of computerized models and Web-based
   inquiry activities helped promote students' ability of mentally
   traversing the four levels of chemistry understanding: symbolic,
   macroscopic, microscopic, and process. More generally, our results
   indicated that incorporating IT-rich PBL into freshmen courses can
   enhance students' understanding of chemical concepts, theories, and
   molecular structures. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore how science teachers'
   epistemological beliefs and teaching goals are related to their use of
   lab activities. Research questions include (a) What are the teachers'
   epistemological beliefs pertaining to lab activities? (b) Why do the
   science teachers use lab activities? (c) How are the teachers'
   epistemological beliefs and instructional goals related to teaching
   actions? Two major aspects of epistemologies guided this study:
   ontological aspect (certainty/diversity of truth) and relational aspect
   (relationship between the knower and the known). The ontological aspect
   addresses whether one views knowledge as one certain truth or as
   tentative multiple truths. The relational aspect addresses whether one
   views him/herself as a receiver of prescribed knowledge separating self
   from knowledge construction or as an active meaning maker connecting
   self to the knowledge construction processes. More sophisticated
   epistemological beliefs include the acknowledgement of multiple
   interpretations of the same phenomena and active role of the knower in
   knowledge construction. Three experienced secondary science teachers
   were interviewed and observed throughout an academic course. The
   findings illustrate that a teacher's naive epistemological beliefs are
   clearly reflected in the teacher's teaching practices. However, a
   teacher's sophisticated epistemological beliefs are not always clearly
   connected to the practice. This seems to be related to the necessary
   negotiation among their epistemological beliefs, teaching contexts, and
   instructional goals. Ontological and relational beliefs seem to be
   connected to different facets of teaching practices. Findings indicate
   that various syntheses of different aspects of epistemological beliefs
   and instructional goals are linked to teachers' diverse ways of using
   lab activities. Implications for research and teacher education are
   discussed. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In this article, I explore the relation between the sociocultural and
   individual cognitive structuring as elementary school students, high
   school students, and adults play the strategic game of dominoes'. I
   present data from a study in which players at each level were observed
   and video-recorded during domino tournament play. Findings reveal the
   cognitive and mathematical skills players developed as well as how
   those skills were fundamentally integrated with shifts in the activity
   structures of the game as players got older. Implications for
   understanding cognition and context and for teaching and learning are
   discussed.

TI Shifting engagements in figured worlds: Middle school mathematics
   students' participation in an architectural design project
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE CLASSROOM
AB Project-based curricula have the potential to engage students'
   interests. But how do students become interested in the goals of a
   project? This article documents how a group of 8th-grade students
   participated in an architectural design project called the Antarctica
   Project. The project is based on the imaginary premise that students
   need to design a research station in Antarctica. This premise is meant
   to provide a meaningful context for learning mathematics. Using
   ethnography and discourse analysis, the article investigates students'
   engagement with the imaginary premise and curricular tasks during the
   7-week project. A case study consisting of scenes from main phases of
   the project shows how the students took on concerns and
   responsibilities associated with the figured world proposed by the
   Antarctica Project and how this shaped their approaches to mathematical
   tasks (Holland, Lachicotte, Skinner, & Cain, 1,998). Participating in
   the figured world of Antarctica and evaluating situations within this
   world was important for how students used mathematics meaningfully to
   solve problems. Curricular tasks and classroom activities that
   facilitated students in assuming and shifting between roles relevant to
   multiple figured worlds (i.e., of the classroom, Antarctica, and
   mathematics) helped them engage in the diverse intentions of curricular
   activities.

   EXPERTISE
AB Participants in 2 experiments interacted with computer simulations
   designed to foster understanding of scientific principles governing
   complex adaptive systems. The quality of participants' transportable
   understanding was measured by the amount of transfer between 2
   simulations governed by the same principle. The perceptual concreteness
   of the elements within the first simulation was manipulated. The
   elements either remained concrete throughout the simulation, remained
   idealized, or switched midway into the simulation from concrete to
   idealized or vice versa. Transfer was better when the appearance of the
   elements switched, consistent with theories predicting more general
   schemas when the schemas are multiply instantiated. The best transfer
   was observed when originally concrete elements became idealized. These
   results are interpreted in terms of tradeoffs between grounded,
   concrete construals of simulations and more abstract, transportable
   construals. Progressive idealization ("concreteness fading") allows
   originally grounded and interpretable principles to become less tied to
   specific contexts and hence more transferable.

ID COURSES; DEMONSTRATIONS; ENVIRONMENT; ENGAGEMENT; EDUCATION; STUDENTS
AB This paper reports on the transition of the researcher's teaching from
   before and during an innovation in teaching practice, including 1 year
   of traditional teaching ( 1996) and 3 years of teaching based on a
   constructivist view of learning ( 1999 - 2001), in a university physics
   course in Taiwan. Learning outcomes for each year were evaluated by
   both standardized conceptual tests and student questionnaire surveys.
   The results indicated a dilemma the researcher had encountered at an
   early stage in the teaching innovation, in contrast to the more
   rewarding outcomes in the longer term. This study indicated the
   promising yet sophisticated nature of this innovative constructivist
   teaching. The success of the teaching innovation may not be obtained
   easily, as criticisms and drawbacks are likely to arise before
   acceptance is achieved. Conscientious and persistent modifications,
   based on feedback from the classroom implementation and on
   understanding of learning theories, are required to achieve success
   from the teaching innovation.

ID ENVIRONMENTS; TECHNOLOGY; SETTINGS
AB Worldwide, voluntary youth organizations such as the Scouts and Guides
   attract a large following. As part of their programme they provide
   science experiences for children and young people. From a research
   perspective, however, this context for informal science education has
   gone largely unexamined. This study explores the field, focusing on the
   Cub Scouts that cater, in the UK, for children aged between 8 and 10.5
   years. The investigation involved an e-mail survey, in-depth interviews
   with 10 leaders, short interviews with 10 Cub Scouts and an unscripted
   role-play performed by the children. Documented is a distinctive and
   engaging out-of-school science provision for participants. The research
   revealed this learning experience to have features that, in terms of a
   continuum spanning formal to informal, lay more toward the informal
   than anticipated in respect of curriculum and assessment, although not
   pedagogy. The children's responses, affective and cognitive, suggest a
   fruitful area for further study.

ID STUDENTS
AB The main goal of most physics textbooks is to develop declarative and
   procedural knowledge. Exercises provide pupils with opportunities to
   apply this knowledge. However, when confronted with more complicated
   exercises many pupils experience difficulties in solving them. A
   computer program about the subject of forces was developed containing
   hints for the various different episodes of problem-solving. A study
   was undertaken with a group taking part in the experiment ( n = 11) who
   used both their textbook and the computer program, and a control group
   ( n = 25) who used their textbook only.
   There was evidence to show that the pupils from the group taking part
   in the experiment did achieve higher results in solving problems.
   Exploration and planning were improved but evaluation was not. It
   appeared that pupils involved in the experiment made better use of
   their declarative knowledge in solving problems than pupils from the
   control group.

TI The formation of science choices in secondary school
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper I examine the formation of post-16 choices over 3 years
   among higher achieving students with respect to enrolment in
   post-compulsory science courses. Transcripts from four interviews
   carried out over 3 years with 72 secondary school students were
   qualitatively analysed. Students were found to shape their choices for
   science in a variety of ways across time. The situation regarding
   science choices hinges on far more dynamic considerations than the
   stereotypical image of the potential advanced science student,
   committed to becoming a scientist from an early age. There is an
   interplay of self-perception with respect to science, occupational
   images of working scientists, relationship with significant adults and
   perceptions of school science The findings are informative for science
   educators and for career guidance professionals who may need to take
   into account the complexity of young people's choices.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID SCHOOL TEACHERS; CONCEPTIONS; SCIENCE
AB In an investigation of 149 pre-service primary teachers' understanding
   of the terms pure and natural, the participants were asked to provide
   definitions of the two words, and classify various substances including
   drugs of abuse, pharmaceuticals, nutriceuticals, and household
   substances as either natural or not natural, and as pure or not pure.
   A common scale of purity and naturalness could be constructed
   consistent with the Rasch model, suggesting that the participants
   conflate the two terms. This conflation is consistent with the
   qualitative data that suggested participants associated both concepts
   within a common spiritual metaphor, heavily laden with emotive content.
   Purity was not seen as relating to the composition of a substance, but
   to its history. The findings may help explain the development of
   persistent non-scientific chemical taxonomies observed in secondary
   students. Furthermore, as health educators, the participants may become
   the source of inappropriate messages about the use of medicines, or the
   abuse of drugs.

AB The assessment of learners' metacognitive knowledge level is crucial
   when developing computer-assisted language learning systems. Currently,
   many systems assess learners' metacognitive knowledge level with
   pre-instructional questionnaires or metacognitive interviews. However,
   learners with limited language proficiency may be at a disadvantage in
   responding to verbal-report interview or questionnaire probes. The goal
   of this study is to present a neural network model that assesses
   automatically the learner's metacognitive knowledge level by observing
   his/her online browsing behavior. The model is implemented through a
   multi-layer feed forward neural network. An experiment was conducted to
   examine the suitability of this model in different Web page structures.
   One hundred and forty-six college students were categorized into three
   groups according to three Web page structures: networked, hierarchical,
   and linear. The experiment results verified the suitability of the
   proposed model, and the MSEs of assessment of the three groups showed
   no significant differences with respect to the Web page structures. (C)

AB This study examines the impact of different metaphors on the process of
   hypertext construction. Two groups of 20 college students with no
   experience in hypertext construction received introductory explanations
   on the text format "hypertext" based on either a book or a space
   metaphor. Then they had to construct hypertexts by linking prepared
   nodes on the topic of the "Internet". The different metaphors had
   significant effects on the constructed hypertexts, the construction
   process, and knowledge acquisition. The book metaphor encouraged a more
   linear way of viewing hypertexts that conflicted with the complexity of
   the contents to be processed. The space metaphor permitted a
   correspondence between complex semantic structures and complex
   hypertext structures. Hence, the space metaphor seems to be more
   appropriate for explaining the text format hypertext to students. (C)

AB This paper examines the effect of heterogeneous resources, available to

   study of collaborative modeling has been conducted in the frame of an
   authentic educational activity in a secondary school. The students
   involved were provided with sets of primitive resources of varying
   degrees of heterogeneity to be used during synchronous
   computer-mediated modeling activities. Analysis of students' peer
   interaction and of the produced solutions revealed that, contrary to
   our expectations, the group with heterogeneous resources produced
   solutions of similar quality to those of the reference group, although
   they were more active, they exchanged more messages, they were involved
   in deeper discussions and collaborated more for building the
   constituent parts of the solution. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Web-based learning systems, if designed appropriately, offer many
   advantages over the traditional learning environments. This study
   addresses the design and development of new approaches and network
   technologies based on the newly induced pedagogical models to support
   collaborative teaching, knowledge sharing, lifelong learning
   opportunities for anyone to offer or participate in courses free of
   charge. The authors propose and implement a Web-based learning
   environment called "School for All" in the Web-based Educities. To
   satisfy the needs of individual instructors, adaptive Web-based
   authoring tools and methods of teaching have been proposed, including
   five adaptive modules - Curriculum Setting, Co-teaching and Privileges
   Setting, Reward Setting, Assessment Setting and Information Sharing
   Setting. Thirty representative courses that used this adaptive School
   for All system were under close observations and investigation. An
   additional questionnaire was also used to collect online teachers'
   perceptions of this Web-based learning environment. Online teachers
   reported that these adaptive modules could support their online
   teaching effectively. More results were presented and more issues
   regarding online teaching were discussed in this paper. (C) 2004

AB This paper focuses on a tool for meaningful, collaborative, interaction
   in a constructionist music composition environment. In particular, it
   describes the design and implementation of "Networked Drum-Steps", an
   application that allows multiple users in different locations to
   collaborate in the process of music composition, but without the use of
   standard notation.
   Findings from the testing of Networked DrumSteps in an educational
   environment show encouraging results. Learners agreed that the piece
   they made together was "different" from something they would have made
   on their own, and that they made it in different way. From a technical
   perspective Networked DrumSteps has proven itself to be highly scalable
   and extendable. Tests done with up to six people collaborating together
   showed no signs of performance deterioration. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study was an attempt to identify the epistemological roots of
   knowledge when students carry out hands-on experiments in physics. We
   found that, within the context of designing a solution to a stated
   problem, subjects constructed and ran thought experiments intertwined
   within the processes of conducting physical experiments. We show that
   the process of alternating between these two modes-empirically
   experimenting and experimenting in thought-leads towards a convergence
   on scientifically acceptable concepts. We call this process mutual
   projection. In the process of mutual projection, external
   representations were generated. Objects in the physical environment
   were represented in an imaginary world and these representations were
   associated with processes in the physical world. It is through this
   coupling that constituents of both the imaginary world and the physical
   world gain meaning. We further show that the external representations
   are rooted in sensory interaction and constitute a semi-symbolic
   pictorial communication system, a sort of primitive 'language', which
   is developed as the practical work continues. The constituents of this
   pictorial communication system are used in the thought experiments
   taking place in association with the empirical experimentation. The
   results of this study provide a model of physics learning during
   hands-on experimentation.

ID QUALITATIVE DIFFERENCES
AB This study investigates the approaches adopted by students to a
   university writing programme designed to help them learn first-year
   undergraduate science. The research design includes phenomenographic
   analyses of 19 interviews and 50 open-ended questionnaires, as well as
   quantitative analyses of the qualitative data. The main results of the
   study are the close association between the quality of the students'
   approaches to writing, including when they use technology, to the way
   they think about writing as a way of learning, and to the level of
   achievement they reach. The results suggest that writing programmes
   designed to help students learn science would be improved if their
   tasks embed issues such as what learning is possible through writing,
   how new technologies can be used to support meaningful writing and who
   should be offering models of how to approach university writing most
   meaningfully.

ID TEXT
AB This experimental study explores how 60 primary-age children's ( 9-11
   years old) understanding of rocks was effected by instruction that used
   the conceptual structure of the rock cycle together with the analogy of
   aluminium can recycling. Using a combination of probes into children's
   understanding, including concept maps and semi-structured interviews,
   changes to the content of their knowledge ( description and
   classification of rocks) as categorized by membership of particular
   hierarchical explanatory frameworks ( constructed from children's
   preintervention responses), and how such knowledge appears be organized
   into possible networks of information, are described. Results are then
   discussed in terms of the impact of the rock cycle, with or without the
   use of the analogy, on children's existing conceptions, followed by
   observations on the positive role of the analogy in supporting
   understanding. In conclusion, the implications for the nature of
   cognitive change in this domain as revealed by children's explanatory
   frameworks and the potential value of the aluminium can analogy in
   supporting children's understanding are addressed.

ID DISCOURSE; EMAIL; WEB
AB Two episodes of tutoring through the internet have been analysed in
   terms of situational, interactive and content perspectives. The
   episodes involved secondary students who submitted queries about
   chemistry issues to an online service provided by teachers. Studies of
   the asking of questions and of the dynamics of classroom interactions
   are employed to discuss the interactive and content factors of this
   approach to teaching - learning. The functions conveyed by students'
   and teachers' utterances are used to identify the structural patterns
   of the interactions. The occurrence of classical and inverted I-R-F
   exchanges, the questioner's role, the continuity of the dialogues, and
   other structural patterns, are used to classify the episodes as being
   Debate and Triadic Dialogue. The notions of mastering cultural tools
   and scaffolding are used to account for how meaning is constructed
   through the interactions.

ID RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY; PROFESSIONAL JOURNALS; PSYCHOLOGY
AB This study conducted a series of content analyses of the articles
   published by International Journal of Science Education, Science
   Education, and Journal of Research in Science Teaching from 1998 to
   2002. A total of 802 research papers were analyzed in terms of the
   authors' nationality, research types and topics. It was found that
   researchers in four major English-speaking countries, including the US,
   the UK, Australia, and Canada, contributed to a majority of the
   publications, but the researchers from other non-English countries may
   have, to a certain extent, gradually played a valuable role on the
   published work. This probably implies that science education research
   may have progressively become an important field recognized by the
   international academic community. This study also found that most of
   the published articles were categorized as empirical studies, while
   position, theoretical and review papers were rarely presented in the
   journals. Although the research topic of students' conceptions and
   conceptual change was the most frequently investigated one in these
   five years, a declining trend was observed when analyzed by year.
   Moreover, in 1998-2002, the research topics related to student learning
   contexts, and social, cultural and gender issues were also received
   relatively more attention among science educators.

AB This study aimed to assess the influence of a philosophy of science (
   POS) course on science teachers' views of nature of science ( NOS),
   perceptions of teaching about NOS, and instructional planning related
   to NOS. Participants were 56 undergraduate and graduate preservice
   secondary science teachers enrolled in a two science-methods course
   sequence, in which participants received explicit, reflective NOS
   instruction. Ten of these participants were also enrolled in a graduate
   survey POS course. The Views of Nature of Science Questionnaire Form C
   coupled with individual interviews was used to assess participants' NOS
   views at the beginning and conclusion of the study. Participants'
   lesson plans and NOS-specific reflection papers were analysed to assess
   the impact of the POS course on their instructional planning related
   to, and perceptions of teaching about, NOS. Results indicated that,
   compared with participants enrolled in the methods courses, the POS
   course participants developed deeper, more coherent understandings of
   NOS. Substantially more of these latter participants planned explicit
   instructional sequences to teach about NOS. Additionally, the POS
   course participants' discourse regarding NOS progressed from a
   preoccupation with the technical, to a concern with the practical, and,
   finally, to a focus on the emancipatory. Their views of teaching about
   NOS in their future classrooms went beyond the customary discourse of
   whether pre-college students should or could be taught about NOS, to
   contemplating changes they needed to bring about in their own teaching
   behaviour and language to achieve consistency with their newly acquired
   NOS understandings.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID SCIENCE-EDUCATION; GENERAL-CHEMISTRY
AB The purpose of this study was to develop and apply a scheme for the
   analysis of flow diagrams. The flow diagrams in question are a
   schematic representation of written instructions that require students
   to process the text of their practical manual. It was hoped that an
   analysis of the flow diagrams would provide insight into students'
   understanding of the manual. To this end, we describe the development
   of a rubric for the analysis of flow diagrams. The analysis showed that
   most students were able to draw flow diagrams that showed evidence of
   deep processing, many of which could be used in place of the practical
   manual. Most students had some concept of how the apparatus worked,
   providing evidence of their initiation into the social practice of
   laboratory work. The analysis also showed that flow diagrams could be
   used to gauge the students' level of understanding of the practical
   manual. Flow diagrams could be considered to be learning tools as well
   as part of the assessment for a practical session.

AB Low participation rates of girls in advanced physics classes are a
   serious problem in many countries. Assuming that physics teachers can
   affect girls' choice to elect advanced physics classes, and that
   teachers' behaviors are affected by their knowledge and beliefs, the
   goal of this study was to investigate physics' teachers' knowledge and
   beliefs regarding girls' low participation rates in physics. Interviews
   were conducted with 25 physics teacher who taught in 25 different high
   schools in an urban area in Israel. The findings show that:
   approximately one-half of the teachers underestimate the severity of
   the problem; almost two-thirds of the teachers do not see it as a
   problem that requires any action; and most teachers do not know what
   can be done to encourage girls to elect physics and to create a more
   gender inclusive physics learning environment. The implications for
   physics teacher education are discussed.

ID SCIENCE
AB This article reports a study of Turkish children's understanding of
   digestion in Grades 4 and 5 ( ages 10-11). Data collection was carried
   out through the use of an open-ended questionnaire administered to 283
   children in three Turkish primary schools. Follow-up interviews were
   conducted with 30 children in Grade 4 and 72 children in Grade 5. The
   most significant finding was the children's conception of the digestive
   process as 'melting of foods' rather than 'breaking foods down'. Some
   other children considered digestion to be a filtering process that is
   performed by the stomach in order to separate the useful and waste
   parts of food. These views 'melting of foods' and 'filtering of foods'
   have not been mentioned in the literature previously. The study
   revealed that social influences and everyday language had an important
   impact on children's learning of the digestive process.

AB A teaching unit on genetics and human inheritance using problem-solving
   methodology was undertaken with fourth-level Spanish Secondary
   Education students ( 15 year olds). The goal was to study certain
   aspects of the students' learning process ( concepts, procedures and
   attitude) when using this methodology in the school environment. The
   change experienced by students in the process of problem-solving is
   discussed: the analysis of the problem, the formulation of hypothesis,
   the design of a solution, the putting into practice of that strategy
   and the analysis of results. As genetics is one of the few biology
   topics best addressed through problem-solving, and problem-solving
   traditionally has been treated in Spain as that of closed problems, it
   is important that we have shown that working with genuine problematic
   situations allows students to successfully solve closed problems
   without prior training.

AB New Zealand is investing in two international studies that assess the
   achievement of students in science-the International Mathematics and
   Science Study and the Programme for International Student Assessment.
   While the studies have very different purposes, they both provide
   extensive data on student achievement in science and about factors that
   impact on this achievement. Currently the international and national
   study reports describe general findings but there has been no
   systematic secondary analysis or commentary by the New Zealand science
   education community. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview
   of these international studies including some of the major findings so
   as to highlight their potential for further interrogation by science
   educators both nationally and internationally to inform policy,
   practice and further research.

AB Models and modelling are key tools for scientists, science teachers and
   science learners. In this paper we argue that classroom-based research
   evidence demonstrates that the use of models and analogies within the
   pedagogy of science education may provide a route for students to gain
   some understanding of the nature of science. A common theme to emerge
   from the literature reviewed here is that in order to successfully
   develop conceptual understandings in science, learners need to be able
   to reflect on and discuss their understandings of scientific concepts
   as they are developing them. Pedagogies that involve various types of
   modelling are most effective when students are able to construct and
   critique their own and scientists' models. Research also suggests that
   group work and peer discussion are important ways of enhancing
   students' cognitive and metacognitive thinking skills. Further we argue
   that an understanding of science models and the modelling process
   enables students to develop a metacognitive awareness of knowledge
   development within the science community, as well as providing the
   tools to reflect on their own scientific understanding.

ID CURRICULUM; LITERACY
AB In science education contexts there appears to be some consensus
   regarding the doing of science but less on the what for. In this paper
   we compare and contrast scientists' view of 'doing science' with the
   practice of 'doing science' in New Zealand classrooms. After examining
   and critiquing these experiences with reference to New Zealand and
   international literature, we identify New Zealand research that
   indicates more fruitful approaches to doing science in classrooms. We
   conclude by suggesting an overarching aim for doing science in the
   classroom that may provide students with a better understanding of the
   Nature of Science as it is practised in the twenty-first century.

TI Locating the global: culture, language and science education for
   indigenous students
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MULTICULTURALISM; UNIVERSALISM
AB The international literature suggests the use of indigenous knowledge
   (IK) and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) contexts in science
   education to provide motivation and self-esteem for indigenous students
   is widespread. However, the danger of alienating culture ( as
   knowledge) from the language in which the worldview is embedded seems
   to have been left out of the philosophical and pedagogical debates
   surrounding research and comment in the field. This paper argues that
   one of the main ways in which indigenous knowledge systems will survive
   and thrive is through the establishment of programmes taught through
   indigenous languages so that a dialectal relationship between language
   and knowledge is established that continues to act as the wellspring.
   The article concludes by reviewing the situation in Aotearoa New
   Zealand with respect to the indigenous population, Maori, and the
   recent science education initiatives in te reo Maori ( Maori language).

AB This article explores the nature of a continuing mismatch between
   curriculum reform rhetoric in science education and actual classroom
   practice. Lack of philosophical consensus about the nature of science (
   NOS); lack of appropriate curriculum guidance, classroom materials and
   pedagogical content knowledge for NOS teaching; teachers' personal
   theories of learning; and the realities of classroom constraints are
   all implicated as interacting factors that contribute to the mismatch.
   Because curriculum policy is political, with pressure brought to bear
   by many interest groups, it is suggested that the science teaching
   community cannot adequately address the issues raised in the absence of
   wider community debate and support.

TI Examining young children's conceptual change process in floating and
   sinking from a social constructivist perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID FRAMEWORK; CLASSROOM; STUDENTS; MOTION; FORCE
AB This paper presents a case study of the process of conceptual change in
   six-year-old children. The process of conceptual change in learning
   about floating and sinking is described from two different viewpoints:
   how the children's conceptions change during the instructional process,
   and how the social discussion during the experimental exploration can
   be seen in terms of the cognitive changes in the children. Based on
   qualitative analysis of verbal data, changes in the children's
   conceptions were mostly epistemological and the children's theories of
   flotation became more complete with respect to the scientific view.
   From the viewpoint of the conceptual change, conceptually orientated
   teacher-child interactions seemed to support the children's cognitive
   progress in cognitive skills and guided the children to consider the
   reasons for the flotation.

   the physics classroom
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

DT Article
ID SCHOOL; ACHIEVEMENT; EDUCATION; WORLDS; FAMILY
AB This study applies the concept of cultural border ( or boundary)
   crossing first introduced by Phelan et al. ( 1991) to the investigation
   of students' attitudes towards physics and to their choice of physics
   for A-level. A typology of border crossings is introduced and a number
   of possible crossings are hypothesized; for example, family background
   ( parents' occupation and thinking style), low general school interest
   among family and peers, students' non-scientific perception of
   knowledge, their 'more-than-just-absorption' purposes of
   knowledge-acquisition and other value-related judgements. The
   quantitative methodology used here makes it possible to build
   regression models of students' attitudes and compare the possible
   impact of the border crossings with that of personality variables and
   teacher and teaching style characteristics. It is found that cultural
   border crossing factors are important predictors for attitudes towards
   physics as well as for choice of A-level physics in the Danish upper
   secondary school ('gymnasium').

ID PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE-EDUCATION;
   BELIEFS; REFORM
AB In this paper, we report on a study of the beliefs of chemistry
   teachers about the teaching and learning of chemistry in upper
   secondary education in The Netherlands. This study was conducted in the
   context of the planning of a national revision of the chemistry
   curriculum towards a context-based approach. Chemistry teachers'
   beliefs were investigated using a questionnaire that focused on both
   content-related ideas about the chemistry curriculum and general
   educational beliefs. The questionnaire was administered to a sample of
   Dutch chemistry teachers ( n = 966), with a response of 348 ( 36%). On
   the basis of factor analysis, two distinct and independent belief
   structures were found: ( 1) a belief that combines the curriculum
   emphasis Fundamental Chemistry with a subject-matter-oriented
   educational belief, and ( 2) a belief that combines the curriculum
   emphasis Chemistry, Technology and Society with a learner-centred
   educational belief. In a cluster analysis, it was found that most
   teachers ( about three-quarters of the respondents) combined elements
   of the two belief structures. However, two relatively small subgroups
   were identified whose beliefs could be described in terms of one of
   these two belief structures. Implications for the innovation of the
   chemistry curriculum are discussed.

ID SCIENTIFIC LITERACY; SCIENCE; CURRICULUM; REFORM; BELIEFS
AB The ongoing reform in science education in many countries, including
   Israel, has attainment of scientific literacy for all as one of its
   main goals. In this context, it is important to provide teachers with
   the opportunity to construct meaning for the term science literacy and
   by doing so to obtain a clear understanding of the new teaching goals.
   Here we report on a study in which teachers, as part of their
   professional development, were involved in defining the term 'chemical
   literacy'; they discussed the need for it, and suggested educational
   experiences that are necessary in order to attain it. The programme was
   conducted as part of a reform in the content, as well as in the
   pedagogy, of chemistry education in Israel. The collected data provide
   some insights regarding the process by which the teachers' perception
   of ` chemical literacy' developed and the way actual school practice
   influences teachers' perception of ` chemical literacy'.

AB There continues to be a gulf between what have been identified from the
   literature as the potential benefits of using computer-aided practical
   work and the difficulties of realizing them as reported by practising
   teachers, even from those who are committed to the use of Information
   and Communication Technology ( ICT). This article reports on a pilot
   study that aimed to explore ways in which teachers could be supported
   as they explore the extent to which this approach could enhance the
   development of pupils' understanding of physics concepts. The study was
   based on a collaborative partnership between a researcher and a
   classroom teacher. The indications are that there is the potential for
   considerable benefits from such an approach, with the need for further
   development of materials and teaching methods being identified.

AB The development of the concept of matter was explored by interviewing
   84 children aged 3-13 in Slovenia. Children were asked to describe
   objects and substances placed in front of them. Children's responses
   were coded and explored for patterns indicating development with age.
   The patterns of responses indicate that by acting on objects and
   substances students first developed prototypes for substances. This was
   followed by increasing use of properties to describe objects and
   substances leading to a growing awareness of the distinction between
   the intensive properties of matter and the extensive properties of
   objects. Children's descriptions were analysed from a Piagetian
   perspective, which hypothesizes that the epigenesis of concepts takes
   place through children acting on the world. Through their actions
   children gradually develop more elaborated schema that enable them to
   distinguish between extensive and intensive properties, and hence
   between object and matter.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID PUPILS PERFORMANCE; TASK CONTEXTS; VARIABLES; IDEAS
AB Recently, the importance of an everyday context in physics learning,
   teaching, and problem-solving has been emphasized. However, do students
   or physics educators really want to learn or teach physics
   problem-solving in an everyday context? Are there not any obstructive
   factors to be considered in solving the everyday context physics
   problems? To obtain the answer to these questions, 93 high school
   students, 36 physics teachers, and nine university physics educators
   participated in this study. Using two types of physics
   problems-everyday contextual problems (E-problems) and decontextualized
   problems (D-problems)-it was found that even though there was no
   difference in the actual performance between E-problems and D-problems,
   subjects predicted that E-problems were more difficult to solve.
   Subjects preferred E-problems on a school physics test because they
   thought E-problems were better problems. Based on the observations of
   students' problem-solving processes and interviews with them, six
   factors were identified that could impede the successful solution of
   E-problems. We also found that many physics teachers agreed that
   students should be able to cope with those factors; however, teachers'
   perceptions regarding the need for teaching those factors were low.
   Therefore, we suggested teacher reform through in-service training
   courses to enhance skills for teaching problem-solving in an everyday
   context.

ID CHILDRENS CONCEPTIONS; GAS STATE; CHEMISTRY; WATER
AB Based on a purposive sample of 15 second-year chemical engineering
   students, this study investigates students' conceptions of evaporation,
   condensation and vapour pressure. During individual interviews the
   students were questioned on three tasks that had been designed around
   these topics. Qualitative analysis of student responses showed a range
   of conceptions in each area, including some misconceptions. A key
   underlying misconception was the belief that evaporation and
   condensation require a temperature gradient in order to take place.
   Many students changed their initial (incorrect) answers when presented
   with further physical evidence as the interview progressed. The study
   points to the importance not only of practical work, but of associated
   conceptual discussions that allow students to reflect on and refine
   their conceptions.

AB This article discusses the results of a mainly qualitative study into
   possible impacts of recent controversial socioscientific issues on a
   group of Portuguese secondary school students regarding their
   conceptions about scientists. The 86 participants: (1) answered a
   questionnaire with open-ended questions; and (2) wrote a science
   fiction story involving a group of scientists working on a particular
   situation of her/his choice. Next, semi-structured interviews were
   carried out to clarify and discuss the ideas embodied in the stories
   and mentioned in the questionnaire. All data underwent a process of
   content analysis. The socio-scientific controversies recently
   discussed, and the way science and scientists are depicted in the
   media, seem to have produced some impact on students' conceptions about
   scientists. Based on the results obtained, some remarks and educational
   implications are discussed.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE
AB In a previous article, the problem of chemistry's lack of relevance in
   secondary chemical education was analysed using logical positivism as a
   tool. This article starts with the hypothesis that the problem can be
   addressed by means of activity theory, one of the important theories
   within the sociocultural school. The reason for this expectation is
   that, while logical positivism creates a divide between science and
   society, activity theory offers a model of society in which science and
   society are related. With the use of this model, a new course for grade
   nine has been constructed. This results in a confirmation of the
   hypothesis, at least at a theoretical level. A comparison with the
   Salters' approach is made in order to demonstrate the relative merits
   of a mediated way of dealing with the problem of the lack of relevance
   of chemistry in chemical education.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID NOVICE TEACHERS; CONCEPTIONS; MATHEMATICS; EDUCATION; IMAGES
AB This study examined prospective elementary teachers' learning about
   scientific inquiry in the context of an innovative life science course.
   Research questions included: (1) What do prospective elementary
   teachers learn about scientific inquiry within the context of the
   course? and (2) In what ways do their experiences engaging in science
   investigations and teaching inquiry-oriented science influence
   prospective elementary teachers' understanding of science and science
   learning and teaching? Eleven prospective elementary teachers
   participated in this qualitative, multi-participant case study.
   Constant comparative analysis strategies attempted to build
   abstractions and explanations across participants around the constructs
   of the study. Findings suggest that engaging in scientific inquiry
   supported the development more appropriate understandings of science
   and scientific inquiry, and that prospective teachers became more
   accepting of approaches to teaching science that encourage children's
   questions about science phenomena. Implications include careful
   consideration of learning experiences crafted for prospective
   elementary teachers to support the development of robust subject matter
   knowledge.

AB A total of 341 Latvian students and eight teachers participated in this
   study of student self-evaluation and teacher evaluation. Students
   completed a 12-lesson teacher-directed instructional program on
   conducting and writing a report of their own experimental research.
   Sixteen classes were randomly assigned to one of four treatment
   conditions: (1) no in-program evaluation, (2) self-evaluation and
   revision at the research design and draft final report stages, (3)
   teacher evaluation and student revision at both stages, (4)
   self-plus-teacher evaluation and student revision at both stages.
   Students in the teacher-evaluation and self-plus-teacher evaluation
   conditions received significantly higher ratings from an independent
   rater on their final research reports. However, students under the
   self-evaluation conditions had greater confidence in their ability to
   conduct future experiments.

AB The effects of different approaches to learning Chinese characters were
   investigated. Ninety-two high-school students were randomly assigned to
   one of five treatment groups: translation, verbal mnemonics, visual
   mnemonics, dual-coding mnemonics, or self-generated mnemonics. All
   groups received instruction and completed posttests in a computer-based
   environment. The results indicate that participants who generated their
   own mnemonics demonstrated higher posttest performance than those in
   visual coding, verbal coding, and translation groups; subjects in the
   dual coding group scored higher than those in the translation group.
   Those who generated their own mnemonics spent more time on task than
   any other group, and, those in the verbal coding group took more time
   than those in the translation group. Survey and qualitative data
   suggest that learners' interpretations of the Chinese characters were
   rooted in their cultural backgrounds and personal experiences.

AB Developments in society and business, and related changes in higher
   education and lifelong learning, require educators and educational
   designers or technologists to rethink education. Examples of such
   changes are the growing importance of achieving complex learning, the
   integration of learning and work in education, and the need for
   improved flexibility with regard to time, place, and individual needs.
   These changes cannot simply be responded to by adding technological
   solutions implemented according to existing educational approaches.
   Instead, an integrated view of e-learning is necessary, characterized
   by the combination of pedagogical, technical, social, and
   organizational factors. This two-part special issue elaborates on the
   different characteristics of integrated e-learning,from design through
   future topics for research.

ID SOCIAL PRESENCE; MEDIA; INSTRUCTION; ISSUES
AB Electronic collaborative learning environments for learning and working
   are in vogue. Designers design them according to their own
   constructivist interpretations of what collaborative learning is and
   what it should achieve. Educators employ them with deferent educational
   approaches and in diverse situations to achieve different ends.
   Students use them, sometimes very enthusiastically, but often in a
   perfunctory way. Finally, researchers study them and-as is usually the
   case when apples and oranges are compared-find no conclusive evidence
   as to whether or not they work, where they do or do not work, when they
   do or do not work and, most importantly, why they do or do not work.
   This contribution presents an affordance framework for such
   collaborative learning environments; an interaction design procedure
   for designing, developing, and implementing them; and an educational
   affordance approach to the use of tasks in those environments. It also
   presents the results of three projects dealing with these three issues.

AB Authenticity is an important element of new modes of assessment. The
   problem is that what authentic assessment really is, is unspecified. In
   this article, we first review the literature on authenticity of
   assessments, along with a five-dimensional framework for designing
   authentic assessments with professional practice as the starting point.
   Then, we present the results of a qualitative study to determine if the
   framework is complete, and what the relative importance of the five
   dimensions is in the perceptions of students and teachers of a
   vocational college for nursing. We discuss implications for the
   framework, along with important issues that need to be considered when
   designing authentic assessments.

AB This study investigates how 25 junior high school students employed
   their bodies of knowledge and responded to problem cues while
   individually performing a science experiment and reasoning about a
   drops phenomenon. Line-by-line content analysis conducted on students'
   written ad hoc explanations aimed to reveal students' concepts and
   their relations within their explanations, and to construe students'
   mental models for the science phenomenon based on level of
   specification, models' correspondence with scientific claims, macro
   versus micro view of matter, and type of evidence used. We then
   inferred four types of knowledge representations for the nature of
   matter. Findings are discussed in terms of implications for science

AB The research reported in this study focuses on the design and
   evaluation of learning environments that support the teaching and
   learning of argumentation in a scientific context. The research took
   place over 2 years, between 1999 and 2001, in junior high schools in
   the greater London area. The research was conducted in two phases. In
   phase 1, working with a group of 12 science teachers, the main emphasis
   was to develop sets of materials and strategies to support
   argumentation in the classroom, and to support and assess teachers'
   development with teaching argumentation. Data were collected by video-
   and audio-recording the teachers' attempts to implement these lessons
   at the beginning and end of the year. During this phase, analytical
   tools for evaluating the quality of argumentation were developed based
   on Toulmin's argument pattern. Analysis of the data shows that there
   was significant development in the majority of teachers use of
   argumentation across the year. Results indicate that the pattern of use
   of argumentation is teacher-specific, as is the nature of the change.
   In phase 2 of the project, the focus of this paper, teachers taught the
   experimental groups a minimum of nine lessons which involved
   socioscientific or scientific argumentation. In addition, these
   teachers taught similar lessons to a comparison group at the beginning
   and end of the year. The purpose of this research was to assess the
   progression in student capabilities with argumentation. For this
   purpose, data were collected from 33 lessons by video-taping two groups
   of four students in each class engaging in argumentation. Using a
   framework for evaluating the nature of the discourse and its quality
   developed from Toulmin's argument pattern, the findings show that there
   was improvement in the quality of students' argumentation. This
   research presents new methodological developments for work in this
   field. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB As part of a larger project aimed at promoting science and literacy for
   culturally and linguistically diverse elementary students, this study
   has two objectives: (a) to describe teachers' initial beliefs and
   practices about inquiry-based science and (b) to examine the impact of
   the professional development intervention (primarily through
   instructional units and teacher workshops) on teachers' beliefs and
   practices related to inquiry-based science. The research involved 53
   third- and fourth-grade teachers at six elementary schools in a large
   urban school district. At the end of the school year, teachers reported
   enhanced knowledge of science content and stronger beliefs about the
   importance of science instruction with diverse student groups, although
   their actual practices did not change significantly. Based on the
   results of this first year of implementation as part of a 3-year
   longitudinal design, implications for professional development and
   further research are discussed. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING

DT Article
ID CLASSROOM; KNOWLEDGE; LITERACY; RELEVANT; PEDAGOGY; POWER
AB Teacher identity development and change is shaped by the
   interrelationship between personal biography and experience and
   professional knowledge linked to the teaching environment, students,
   subject matter, and culture of the school. Working from this framework,
   this study examines how beginning teacher interns who are part of an
   alternative route to teacher certification construct a professional
   identity as science educators in response to the needs and interests of
   urban youth. From the teacher interns, we learn that crafting a
   professional identity as a middle-level science teacher involves
   creating a culture around science instruction driven by imagining "what
   can be," essentially a vision for a quality and inclusive science
   curriculum implicating science content, teaching methods, and
   relationships with their students. The study has important implications
   for the preparation of a stronger and more diverse teaching force able
   to provide effective and inclusive science education for all youth. It
   also suggests the need for greater attention to personal and
   professional experience and perceptions as critical to the development
   of a meaningful teacher practice in science. (C) 2004 Wiley

   TECHNOLOGY; STUDENTS; TEACHER; SCHOOL; INNOVATIONS; KNOWLEDGE; DESIGN
AB Science education standards established by American Association for the
   Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the National Research Council (NRC)
   urge less emphasis on memorizing scientific facts and more emphasis on
   students investigating the everyday world and developing deep
   understanding from their inquiries. These approaches to instruction
   challenge teachers and students, particularly urban students who often
   have additional challenges related to poverty. We report data on
   student learning spanning 3 years from a science education reform
   collaboration with the Detroit Public Schools. Data were collected from
   nearly 8,000 students who participated in inquiry-based and
   technology-infused curriculum units that were collaboratively developed
   by district personnel and staff from the University of Michigan as part
   of a larger, district-wide systemic reform effort in science education.
   The results show statistically significant increases on
   curriculum-based test scores for each year of participation. Moreover,
   the strength of the effects grew over the years, as evidenced by
   increasing effect size estimates across the years. The findings
   indicate that students who historically are low achievers in science
   can succeed in standards-based, inquiry science when curriculum is
   carefully developed and aligned with professional development and
   district policies. Additional longitudinal research on the development
   of student understanding over multiple inquiry projects, the progress
   of teacher enactment over time, and the effect of changes in the policy
   and administrative environment would further contribute to the
   intellectual and practical tools necessary to implement meaningful
   standards-based systemic reform in science. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals,

ID PROJECT-BASED SCIENCE; CLASSROOMS; INQUIRY
AB Design-Based Science (DBS) is a pedagogy in which the goal of designing
   an artifact contextualizes all curricular activities. Design is viewed
   as a vehicle through which scientific knowledge and real-world
   problem-solving skills can be constructed. Following Anderson and
   Hogan's (1999) call to document the design of new science pedagogics,
   this goal of this article is twofold: (a) to describe DBS, and (b) to
   evaluate whether significant science knowledge was constructed during
   consecutive enactments of three DBS units. In this study, 92 students
   participated in the consecutive enactments of three different DBS
   units. The development of their scientific knowledge was assessed
   through posters and models constructed during the curricular enactments
   and by identical pre- and post-instruction written tests. The
   post-tests Showed considerable gains compared with the pretests, while
   the models and posters show application of this newly constructed
   knowledge in solving a design problem. These positive results support
   efforts being made to restructure school science around inquiry-based
   curricula in general and design-based curricula in particular. (C) 2004

ID SCIENTIFIC LITERACY; EDUCATION; SENSE
AB The purpose of this article is to report findings from an ethnographic
   study that focused on the co-development of science literacy and
   academic identity formulation within a third-grade classroom. Our
   theoretical framework draws from sociocultural theory and studies of
   scientific literacy. Through analysis of classroom discourse, we
   identified opportunities afforded students to learn specific scientific
   knowledge and practices during a series of science investigations. The
   results of this study suggest that the collective practice of the
   scientific conversations and activities that took place within this
   classroom enabled students to engage in the construction of communal
   science knowledge through multiple textual forms. By examining the ways
   in which students contributed to the construction of scientific
   understanding, and then by examining their performances within and
   across events, we present evidence of the co-development of students'
   academic identities and scientific literacy. Students' communication
   and participation in science during the investigations enabled them to
   learn the structure of the discipline by identifying and engaging in
   scientific activities. The intersection of academic identities with the
   development of scientific literacy provides a basis for considering
   specific ways to achieve scientific literacy for all students. (C) 2004
