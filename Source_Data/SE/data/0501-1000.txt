AB Digital plagiarism is a problem for educators all over the world. There
   are many software tools on the market for uncovering digital
   plagiarism. Most of them can work only with text submissions. In this
   paper, we present a new architecture for a plagiarism detection tool
   that can work with many different kinds of digital submissions, from
   plain or formatted texts to audio podcasts. The open architecture is
   based on converting the digital submission into text form for
   processing by a plagiarism detection algorithm. To process non-text
   submissions, the system is extended with the appropriate converter.
   Such an open architecture makes the anti-plagiarism toolbox universal
   and easily adaptable for processing virtually any kind of digital
   submissions. This paper describes a software prototype based on the
   proposed architecture and presents the results Of its implementation on
   a large archive of student papers. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB One of the key challenges in the promotion of web-based learning is the
   development of effective collaborative learning environments. We posit
   that the structuration process strongly influences the effectiveness of
   technology used in web-based collaborative learning activities. in this
   paper, we propose an ant swarm collaborative learning (ASCL)
   environment based on a swarm intelligence system (SIS) that structures
   opportunities for effective collaboration and learning in a dynamic
   way. The results of our experiments indicate that: (1) the
   self-organizing behavior of SIS is positively associated with system
   appropriation: (2) the multi-agent-based mechanism of SIS is positively
   associated with system appropriation; (3) the cohesive capability of
   SIS is positively associated with system appropriation; and (4) the
   learner's tendency toward system appropriation is positively associated
   with learning effectiveness. Our findings also show that learners in an
   ASCL environment outperform their counterparts in a general web-based
   learning (GWL) environment. We conclude that different types of
   technological support can influence the achievement in a web-based
   learning environment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of the
   meta-cognitive strategies on the academic and gaming achievements.
   Exploring the effects of those achievements on the social problem
   solving of students is also of interest. For this purpose, the MMORPG
   Gersang was used. The participants, consisting of ninth graders, played
   the game until they all reached the third level to ensure that they
   have the same gaming ability prior to gaming for the study. Three
   meta-cognitive strategies were developed: self-recording, modeling and
   thinking aloud. Those strategies are specially related to gaming
   activities and applied in pre-gaming activities, gaming activities, and
   post-gaming activities. Three meta-cognitive strategies were set as
   independent variables. The social problem solving ability was set as a
   mediating variable, and academic achievement and scores in the game
   were chosen as dependent variables. The path between meta-cognitive
   strategies and both academic achievement and game performance by
   mediating social problem solving abilities were discovered. The social
   problem solving ability, which is the mediating variable, affects the
   academic achievement and the game performance very strongly. These
   results imply that a commercial game playing in conjunction with
   meta-cognitive strategies can be an effective way to increase students'
   performance both in learning and gaming by keeping them involved.
   Talking and observation activities such as thinking aloud and modeling
   are more effective than writing activities in enhancing the students'
   achievements both in learning and gaming. Crown Copyright (C) 2008

AB In this paper, we identify key challenges faced by computer-based
   assessment (CBA) in secondary education and we put forward a framework
   of design considerations: design with the students and teachers, select
   the most appropriate media platform and plan an evolution rather than a
   revolution of prior practices. We present the CBA application 'MyTest'
   which was developed using the participatory methodology We!Design, with
   the collaboration of 31 students and teachers. The application is
   targeted for the Tablet PC platform, provides "digital ink"
   capabilities and supports both closed-type and open questions,
   facilitating the transfer of traditional assessment practices to CBA.
   Both students and teachers were excited about the design sessions, and
   they asserted that they would rely more on educational software
   designed using this approach. The comparison of the 'MyTest'
   application with an assessment application developed with the same
   participatory methodology and the involvement of 40 undergraduate
   students revealed dissimilar expectations and needs of high school and
   undergraduate students that are often disguised or misinterpreted. A
   pilot evaluation of the application in real learning conditions was
   conducted with 31 students using Tablet PCs and with 37 students using
   traditional PCs. Interestingly, the Tablet PC platform rendered the
   'MyTest' application more useful and usable to the students, validating
   our claims. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to clarify the relationship between media, learners'
   perception of social presence. and output in communicative learning
   using synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC). In this
   study, we developed four types of SCMC: videoconferencing (image and
   voice), audioconferencing (voice but no image), text chat with image
   (image but no voice), and plain text chat (no image and no voice). Each
   system allows learners to be conscious of and utter a target formulaic
   expression. I investigated the effect of each system on psychological
   perception and productive output as well as the relationship between
   perception and output. The results show that image and voice promote
   consciousness of natural communication and relief, while a
   text-mediated system enhances confidence in grammatical accuracy. In
   order to clarify the relationship between media, affective side, and
   output, path analysis was conducted using SPSS Amos 7.0. The results
   indicated that voice communication strongly affects both learners'
   affective side and output. The existence of a partner's image enhances
   the consciousness of natural communication, which leads to a number of
   self-corrections, an aspect of learning performance. However, voice
   communication has a negative effect on confidence in grammatical
   accuracy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study reports on the development of ESP (English for specific
   purposes) courseware for semiconductor technology and its integration
   as a "silent partner" into instruction. This kind of team-teaching
   could help overcome current problems encountered in developing ESP in
   Taiwan. The content of the material under discussion includes general
   knowledge about fundamental theories, process technologies and
   applications within the semiconductor industry. In the design of the
   whole courseware, five skills for learning English (listening,
   speaking, reading, writing, and translation) have been considered and a
   3D multimedia technique has been used to promote learning interest,
   student engagement, and efficiency. The design of the courseware
   endeavors to mainly follow principles by [Mayer, R. E. (2001).
   Multimedia learning. New York: Cambridge University Press]. Students
   report they have benefited from the courseware implementation. Initial
   evaluations suggest that students are satisfied with practices for
   learning professional knowledge and English skills provided by the
   courseware. They report that the multimedia-assisted environment of the
   courseware promotes learning effectiveness. Students with higher
   achievement on the posttest showed better participation and motivation,
   made greater use of the multimedia and had a better understanding of
   the English content so that they are more competent to function in a
   professional and learner-centered ESP course using the courseware. (C)

AB The purpose of the study is to explore three kinds of personal
   affective traits among high-school students and their effects on
   web-based concept learning. The affective traits include personal
   preferences about web-based learning environments, personal
   epistemological beliefs, and beliefs about web-based learning. One
   hundred 11th graders participated in the study. Three questionnaires
   were developed to assess these affective characteristics. An online
   test and the flow-map technique were employed to probe concept
   achievements that indicated the learning outcome. Descriptive
   statistics, t-tests, correlation and regression analyses were conducted
   to present trends and relations among variables. It was found that
   participants of the study who mostly had not developed sophisticated
   epistemological beliefs displayed only moderate preferences toward
   explorative and interactive web-based learning environments, and they
   seemed to be conservative about the effectiveness of the new type of
   learning. According to the flow-map technique, the serial form of
   concept achievements was the main product of concept learning in the
   explorative web-based environments defined in the study. Regression
   analyses indicated that while preferences toward inquiry-based
   instructional designs and outward interactions, and the simple form of
   personal epistemology predicted concept achievements, beliefs about
   effectiveness of web-based learning resulted in a negative impact on
   concept learning. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The benefit of PowerPoint (TM) is continuously debated, but both
   supporters and detractors have insufficient empirical evidence. its use
   in university lectures has influenced investigations of PowerPoint's
   effects on student performance (e.g., overall quiz/exam scores) in
   comparison to lectures based on overhead projectors, traditional
   lectures (e.g., "chalk-and-talk"), and online lectures. Thus far,
   comparisons of overall exam scores have yielded mixed results. The
   present study decomposes overall quiz scores into auditory, graphic,
   and alphanumeric scores to reveal new insights into effects of
   PowerPoint presentations on student performance. Analyses considered
   retention of lecture information presented to students without the
   presence of PowerPoint (i.e., traditional lecture), auditory
   information in the presence of PowerPoint, and visual (i.e., graphic
   and alphanumeric) information displayed on PowerPoint slides. Data were
   collected from 62 students via quiz and questionnaire. Students
   retained 15% less information delivered verbally by the lecturer during
   PowerPoint presentations, but they preferred PowerPoint presentations
   over traditional presentations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The use of PowerPoint slides has become an almost ubiquitous practice
   in university classrooms, however little research has examined whether
   the timing of lecture slide availability to students (either before or
   after lecture) affects classroom behaviour or exam performance. Using a
   2 (slide availability condition) x 2 (course type) between-subjects
   design, the present study examined lecture slide availability
   differences in attendance, participation, and exam performance in two
   courses - Research Methods and Cognitive Development - taught in both
   the Fall and Winter semesters. For each type of course, lecture slides
   were made available on the course website before lecture in one
   semester and after lecture in the other semester. Course material was
   held constant across semesters. Results showed that mean attendance was
   higher when slides were available before lecture, but only for the type
   of course that did not include attendance points as part of students'
   final grades. For students who participated in class, participation was
   more frequent when slides were available before lecture. No significant
   difference in exam performance was found between lecture slide
   availability conditions, however. These findings suggest that making
   lecture slides available to students before lecture may lead to better
   overall attendance and participation, but exam performance is
   determined by more than just whether or not students have lecture
   slides available for their note-taking. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Giving feedback on second language (L2) writing is a challenging task.
   This research proposed an interactive environment for error correction
   and corrective feedback. First, we developed an online corrective
   feedback and error analysis system called Online Annotator for EFL
   Writing. The system consisted of five facilities: Document Maker,
   Annotation Editor, Composer, Error Analyzer, and Viewer. With this
   system, teachers can mark error corrections on online documents and
   students can receive corrective feedback accordingly. The system also
   classifies and displays error types based on user query. Second, an
   experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this system.
   Fifty EFL (English as a Foreign Language) college freshmen were
   randomly assigned to two groups. The experimental group received
   corrective feedback with the developed system whereas the control group
   used the paper-based error correction method. After the treatment,
   students in both groups conducted corrective feedback activities by
   correcting the same document written by an EFL student. The
   experimental results were encouraging in that the analysis of students'
   corrective feedback revealed significantly better performance in the
   experimental group on recognizing writing errors. Implications for
   further research are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The research presented in this paper reaches towards a better
   theoretical understanding of how students in higher education currently
   take notes, how this process is evolving in the digital age to include
   information assimilation, and the kinds of support students need to be
   successful with their changing academic tasks. To gain insight into
   these questions, we triangulated three major and distinct user studies.
   First we interviewed 70 university students from various disciplines
   across campus, and we administered questionnaires to these same
   students, receiving back a total of 68. Our second study was based on
   participant observation whereby we "shadowed" 32 university students
   for 2-3 h each as they went about their normal academic business around
   campus. Lastly, we conducted a broader-based questionnaire with 280
   students from a wider campus demographic than our first survey. We
   sought a diverse population for our research. and were able to include
   students from the disciplines of Business, English, Computer Science,
   Chemistry, Psychology, Pharmacy and Biology in one or more of the
   studies. We discovered how closely students are connected to technology
   and how they are adapting to changing expectations, current issues they
   have completing their academic tasks, how they view traditional
   notetaking versus electronic notetaking, and evidence that they are
   engaging more and more in the process of information assimilation. From
   these results, we conclude that students in higher education might
   accomplish certain tasks more effectively and efficiently with a
   well-designed software system that provides access to a centralized set
   of notes from different locations on campus and beyond. After
   identifying functional requirements for the system we envision, we
   preview our initial low-fidelity prototypes, and discuss feedback we
   gathered on these designs from a set of user focus groups. (C) 2008

AB Computer software is pervasive in today's society. The rate at which
   new versions of computer software products are released is phenomenal
   when compared to the release rate of new products in traditional
   industries such as aircraft building. This rapid rate of change can
   partially explain why most certifications in the software industry are
   generic as opposed to those in the aircraft-building industry where
   engineers and technicians are certified to work on a specific aircraft.
   For example, a software engineer may be certified on a database
   management system, but not on a specific implementation based on the
   database management system. Hence, software engineers are allowed to
   make critical changes to specific designs for the next release of a
   software product with little formal assessment of their understanding
   of the design. This paper presents a system that automatically
   generates just-in-time online assessments for judging a software
   engineer's comprehension of artifacts representing software designs.
   The assessments thus generated are compliant with the IMS-QTI 2.1
   standard. The system is based on the AXIS web-services architecture and
   provides a priori statistical estimates of effectiveness of each
   individually generated assessment.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate the main barriers and
   possible enablers for integrating information and communication
   technologies (ICTs) in Turkey's pre-service teacher education programs.
   The data were collected by means of questionnaires from 53 deans in
   schools of teacher education (STE), 111 teacher educators, and 1,330
   prospective teachers, and additionally from interviews of six teacher
   educators and six prospective teachers. The findings indicate that the
   majority of the stakeholders believe that lack of in-service training,
   lack of appropriate software and materials, and lack of hardware are
   the main barriers for integrating ICTs in pre-service teacher education
   programs. There was also agreement on the possible enablers; "having
   technology plans" was the strategy most strongly agreed upon in that
   category. Based on these findings, we propose the use of several
   strategies that should enhance successful ICTs integration.

AB This study aims to strategically use computer-mediated communication
   (CMC) tools to build online communication environments for
   problem-based learning (PBL). A six-stage process was proposed for
   online PBL learning in this study: 1) identifying the problem, 2)
   brainstorming, 3) collecting and analyzing information, 4) synthesizing
   information, 5) co-building knowledge, and 6) refining the outcomes.
   The one hundred undergraduate students who participated in this study
   were randomly grouped into 13 groups. Multiple methods of data
   collection were adopted to investigate students' learning activities in
   the online PBL course. The methods of data triangulation and
   investigator triangulation were used to analyze the following: 1) the
   use of CMC tools, 2) students' learning achievement, 3) students'
   experience in the online PBL course, and 4) group learning activities.
   The empirical evidence showed that students were able to communicate,
   discuss, and co-build the knowledge from the collected information.
   With the online communication, they were able to seek solutions to the
   problems in learning activities. Meanwhile, students were satisfied
   with the online PBL course. The successful experience of course design
   in this study can encourage instructors to use open-source or
   free-hosted CMC services to develop online PBL courses.

   applicant would matriculate into and successfully complete an online
   secondary teacher certification program. Results of statistical
   analyses conducted on 170 applicants over the past three years affirm
   the importance of the applicant's performance on the state content
   licensure examination. Other academic variables and biographic
   variables were found not to influence success in completing this

AB A distributed online curriculum and courseware development model
   (DONC2) is developed and tested in this study. Courseware development
   teams which may work in different institutions who need to develop high
   quality, reduced cost, on time products will be the users of DONC2. The
   related features from the disciplines of instructional design and
   software engineering were combined. The research is conducted as a
   collective case study, including four cases with distinctive
   characteristics to reveal the several practices in online curriculum
   and courseware development work. The DONC2 development model was
   proposed using the results gathered from the investigated cases and a
   literature survey. The model uses the iterative incremental and agile
   software development approaches in order to overcome the disadvantages
   of other linear development approaches. This enables building
   releasable yet good quality products in short time periods.
   Furthermore, continuous communication, evaluation and feedback as well
   as good project management and readiness to adapt to changes are
   integrated as the essential characteristics. DONC2 is different then
   previous linear and non-adaptive models in all of these aspects. The
   model was tested with one of the cases while being improved with
   success. It was applied as a development model for scheduling of the
   courseware development project in the last case and considered as
   helpful for the success of the project by the project team members.

AB Online learning has been burgeoning over the past decade with one of
   the more popular modes of conducting online learning being the
   asynchronous online courses. Within the asynchronous online course, the
   asynchronous discussion forum replaces the face-to-face interaction of
   the traditional classroom, but is this form of discussion able to
   enhance the learning process? This paper reviews the literature
   regarding asynchronous discussion forums finding that that the
   asynchronous discussion forum is able to generate the critical
   dimensions of learning found in the traditional classroom, but it has
   its limitations.

TI Using webquests for oral communication in English as a foreign language

AB A long-standing debate in native and foreign language learning revolves
   around the use of computers to promote genuine social and professional
   communication. Webquests are a very common way of using Web resources
   to research a variety of topics, and if appropriately used can trigger
   the situations necessary to develop both written and oral
   communication. A webquest is a research activity that requires the
   learner "to collect information about a subject using the web" (Sharma
   & Barrett, 2007: 24). Much has been said about synchronous and
   asynchronous communication but relatively little research has been
   carried out on the effect of webquests in in-classroom communication.
   The aim of webquests is to motivate and promote students' critical
   thinking in order to solve problems or develop projects. This paper
   presents a practical background for using webquests, mainly orally.
   Oral use of webquests is rarely addressed in research and is especially
   valid for students of foreign languages for professional purposes, and
   specifically English. The framework hereby presented addresses three
   main aspects of the use of webquests: as a social constructivist
   learning approach, as a professional development activity and as an
   oral development task. If the use of webquests is associated with
   students' professional needs, their implementation can be very
   successful and help students' skills both in language development and
   cooperative work. This paper also provides a real example to facilitate
   the understanding of the theoretical concepts.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine whether matching navigation
   mode of a learning environment with learners' preferred navigation mode
   would facilitate their learning in a web environment. Sixty-eight
   undergraduate students were randomly assigned to treatments (linear vs.
   nonlinear navigation mode) and received four criterion tests designed
   to measure different educational objectives immediately after
   interacting with the instructional material about human heart. The
   results suggested that matching or mismatching navigation mode of the
   learning environment with learners' preference did not lead to
   significant differences in learning outcomes. However, there were
   significant differences in achievement between groups with different
   navigation mode preferences. Our findings indicated that students
   preferring nonlinear navigation had significantly higher achievement
   scores on higher levels of learning outcomes. Based on the results of
   the study, we discussed specific recommendations for instructional
   designers and the issue concerning matching/mismatching navigation
   modes with learning preferences.

AB Dealing effectively with information and communication technology in
   the information society is a complex task and the human dimension is
   often under-estimated. This paper tries to give a voice to some
   managers about their experiences with information, communication and
   technology in their working environment, which involves participating
   in a learning organisation, knowledge management and communities of
   practice, competency management, ICT-Security awareness management as
   well as and innovation and change management. Managers of a large
   governmental organisation in the Netherlands were polled in a
   questionnaire requesting their responses in using ICT as well as
   involvement in the above categories. The responses of 246 of them were
   analysed. It was found that they knew full well that their strongest
   need was for a conceptual understanding of the implications of ICT in
   their changed work environment. This need overarched the elementary
   end-user training needs of what buttons to press to achieve what end.
   The research findings emphasize that as education is increasingly
   need-driven instead of content-driven it is necessary to reconsider the
   curricula of higher educational institutes especially with regards to
   management training. Furthermore, this research highlights a need for
   on the job training and performance support for middle managers.

AB Learner satisfaction has been shown to be positively correlated with
   quality of learning outcomes. An understanding of the factors that
   influence student satisfaction with online learning in a particular
   context can be used as an input to the appropriate design of learning
   environments, and for the provision of targeted support to students,
   with an aim to positively influence the student online learning
   experience. Following the mandatory inclusion of at least one wholly
   online unit of study in all undergraduate programs at Deakin
   University, a large 'experiences of learning online' (ELO) survey was
   undertaken to gauge students' perceptions of studying in the wholly
   online mode. A multivariate linear regression of all the questionnaire
   items was performed against an overall satisfaction item. Five items
   were found to significantly contribute to a model that explained
   approximately 70% of reported student satisfaction. Factors that were
   found to positively influence student satisfaction with studying a
   wholly online unit primarily related to how confident they felt about
   their ability to communicate and learn online, having a clear
   understanding of what was required to succeed in the unit and how well
   they thought they were performing in the unit. Other results are also
   reported.

AB This paper describes and assesses the development of an online solution
   for the experiential support of distance learning by teachers. Three
   hundred and forty-eight randomly selected K-12 teachers participated in
   this pilot study using the online learning environment designed in this
   research. Teachers' products, surveys, and interviews were collected
   and analysed. Results showed that the teacher-learners could learn as
   well as in face-to-face learning in an earlier implementation of the
   course. The learning support system as designed fits teacher-learners'
   needs. They benefited from learning communities formed online as well
   as face-to-face. More support for online discussion and example cases
   are needed to support experiential learning. Suggestions are made to
   improve the design of the learning support system and the pedagogy for
   experiential teacher learning.

AB In today's fast-changing business environment, teams have emerged as a
   requirement for business success. However, in schools and universities,
   students are usually not taught teamwork skills. In this paper, we
   introduce learning to collaborate by collaborating, a process that
   enables collaboration and teamwork skills to be taught and measured
   through face-to-face collaborative work and class-wide activities
   supported by wirelessly connected hand-held devices. Following a
   description of learning to collaborate by collaborating, we present an
   experimental study whose results demonstrate that participants in the
   process displayed improved teamwork performance. We conclude that it is
   possible to effectively teach collaboration skills through the use of
   immediate feedback provided by a supporting technology.

AB The purpose of this study is to explore how groups decide to use
   asynchronous online discussion forums in a non-mandatory setting, and,
   after the group decision is made, how group members use online
   discussion forums to complete a collaborative learning project
   requiring complex data gathering and research processes. While a large
   body of research on computer-mediated communication (CMC) has
   documented successful intervention strategies to promote and sustain
   online discussion forums, little of the research has examined the use
   of online discussion forums in voluntarily contexts, wherein the
   decision to use online discussion forums is a personal decision and
   participation is not a graded component. This study approaches the
   research questions using a naturalistic case study of one
   graduate-level blended learning course with 55 students. Employing both
   student interviews and content analysis methods, this study revealed
   that the factors affecting the group decision to use online discussion
   forums are (1) successful or unsuccessful experiences during the first
   trial, (2) perceived affordances of CMC tools, and (3) the interplay
   between the nature of collaborative tasks and perceived efficiency. The
   content analysis of online postings in two voluntary groups revealed
   that when groups decided to use online discussion forums, participation
   levels were almost equal among individual group members, and discussion
   threads were sustained until the final completion of the collaborative
   project.

AB Net-based collaborative learning discourses often suffer from
   deficiencies such as lack of coherence and coordination. It is
   suggested that the provision of two functionalities, referencing and
   typing, which learners may optionally use to ground their contributions
   during a chat-based discourse, can improve collaborative learning. In
   particular, we examined if goal focus, type of task and group size
   affect learning outcomes and the use of these functionalities. A
   chat-based system, called a learning protocol, implements these
   functionalities and serves as a net-based collaborative learning
   environment. Results suggest that a learning protocol is more
   beneficial for knowledge-acquisition tasks than for problem-solving
   tasks, and that the use of supporting functionalities increases when
   goal focus is on the group rather than on the individual. Also, there
   is a tendency that learning outcomes improve as group size increases.
   We propose that learning protocols provide potentially valuable design
   features that can promote net-based collaborative learning.

AB This article examines the impact of the introduction of roles and the
   added value of self-assessment on students' level of knowledge
   construction in online asynchronous discussions in a first-year
   university course in instructional sciences. Students' postings in 20
   discussion groups were used as the research data for this study. All
   messages, submitted during the 12-week discussion period and comprising
   four discussion themes of 3 weeks each, were analysed.
   Repeated-measures multilevel modeling was adopted to analyse the data
   from the content analysis. The results point at a significant positive
   impact of assigning roles to students. However, this positive impact
   depends on the moment of the introduction of the roles. Higher levels
   of social knowledge construction were found in discussion groups where
   roles were introduced right at the start of the discussions and faded
   out towards the end. The results further indicate that self-assessment
   has no significant added value.

TI Coding procedures to analyse interaction patterns in educational web

DE asynchronous learning environment; computer-supported collaborative
   learning; interaction patterns; social network analysis
ID DISCUSSIONS; FRAMEWORK
AB Analysis of interaction patterns is one of the most important
   indicators of quality of learning in educational web forums. Social
   network analysis (SNA) is gradually assuming importance in the study of
   interaction patterns as it focuses on the analysis of the
   interrelationships between individuals, thus providing a holistic
   perspective on group performance. However, most of the studies that use
   SNA in computer-supported collaborative learning scenarios derive their
   data from server log files, on the assumption that this data source
   reflects the way people really interacted online. This study, the
   purpose of which is to better understand the communication flows that
   really occur among users, challenges these assumptions through an
   experimental study that makes a comparison between the structural
   method normally used to detect the posting addressees and an approach
   enriched with semantic coding. Results show that this new coding
   schema, if compared with traditional structural coding, detected a
   greater number of addressees, thus allowing a greater number of
   postings to be included in an SNA adjacency matrix.

AB The present study explores the environmental attitudes (EA) of senior
   high school students in Turkey, explains which determinant factors
   affect these EAs, and concludes with some suggestions for curricular
   reform. This study includes over nine hundred students from different
   school types, neighbourhoods, geographical regions, and socioeconomic
   backgrounds. The researcher used two different questionnaires that were
   based on postmaterialist values: one based on the New Environmental
   Paradigm (NEP) and the other developed by the researcher called the
   General Environmental Attitudes and Perceptions (GAP). The results of
   ANOVA and t-tests show that EAs of students vary depending on school
   type, gender, parents' education levels, parents' political views,
   professions, and household income. Students at public high schools,
   females, lower middle class students, students with well educated
   parents in white-collar professions, and students with liberal parents
   have more pro-environmental attitudes than the others. Students from
   vocational schools, almost all of which are based on single-sex
   education, have scored the lowest on both surveys.

TI Cognitive Pathways: Analysis of students' written texts for science

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID LEARN; QUESTIONS; KNOWLEDGE; INQUIRY
AB The purpose of this study was to reconstruct writers' reasoning process
   as reflected in their written texts. The codes resulting from the text
   analysis were related to cognitive operations, ranging from simple to
   more sophisticated ones. The sequence of the cognitive operations as
   the text unfolded represents the writer's cognitive pathway at the time
   the text was produced. This type of analysis was used to study the
   impact that three different types of inquiries had on the reasoning
   process of low-achieving and high-achieving students when performing
   their laboratory activity using the Science Writing Heuristic. The
   researchers found that the reasoning pathways for both low-achieving
   and high-achieving students were similar for each type of inquiry,
   characterized as being decision-making, descriptive/speculative, and
   application. The reasoning pathways for the decision-making and
   application inquiries appear to be more structured than the pathways
   for the descriptive/speculative activity. The dependence between
   students' achievement levels and the type of inquiry in relation to
   specific use of thinking operations was tested using a chi-square
   analysis, with the results indicating that the reasoning operations
   performed by the students are independent of their achievement level
   and dependent on the inquiry type. Higher-order operations were
   extensively used in the decision-making inquiry and less used in the
   application activity. Low-order cognitive operations, such as
   observations and comparisons, were extensively used in the
   descriptive/speculative inquiry while being less used in the
   decision-making inquiry activity.

   wolves. The research design was a case study across three years
   employing descriptive statistics to portray student knowledge and
   understanding associated with the use of each tool. The findings
   indicate that multimodal assessment tools enable second graders to

TI Essential Criteria to Characterize Constructivist Teaching: Derived
   from a review of the literature and applied to five
   constructivist-teaching method articles
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID BIOLOGY; TEACHERS; WORKS
AB Constructivism is an important theory of learning that is used to guide
   the development of new teaching methods, particularly in science
   education. However, because it is a theory of learning and not of
   teaching, constructivism is often either misused or misunderstood. Here
   we describe the four essential features of constructivism: eliciting
   prior knowledge, creating cognitive dissonance, application of new
   knowledge with feedback, and reflection on learning. We then use the
   criteria we developed to evaluate five representative published
   articles that claim to describe and test constructivist teaching
   methods. Of these five articles, we demonstrate that three do not
   adhere to the constructivist criteria, whereas two provide strong
   examples of how constructivism can be employed as a teaching method. We
   suggest that application of the four essential criteria will be a
   useful tool for all professional educators who plan to implement or
   evaluate constructivist teaching methods.

TI Developing High Quality Decision-Making Discussions About Biological
   Conservation in a Normal Classroom Setting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

   EDUCATION; BEHAVIOR; CHILDREN; CONTEXT; VALUES
AB The conservation of biodiversity is an important socio-scientific issue
   that is often regarded as a precondition to sustainable development.
   The foundation for citizens' understanding of conservation issues can
   be laid down in formal school education. This research focuses on
   decision-making discussions about biological conservation issues among
   131 15-16-year-old students, to address two main research questions:
   Can peer group decision-making discussions, in a normal science lesson
   setting, help develop students' personal reasoning in relation to
   conservation issues? Are there features common to high quality
   discussions about conservation which might be readily identified by
   classroom teachers? Findings indicate the positive value of students
   taking part in these short decision-making discussions guided by a
   structured framework and as part of their normal science classroom
   activities. Students increase their quality of personal reasoning, and
   modify their solutions to the issues. The study begins to uncover
   features about students both as individuals and as members of
   discussion groups, which can be associated with high quality
   decision-making about conservation issues, and which teachers might
   realistically identify. The work calls for the need to cultivate these
   features and to integrate them appropriately with learning about the
   scientific concepts that underpin the theory and practice of
   conservation management. Such integration will facilitate the
   development of teaching strategies for dealing effectively with the
   complex topic of biological conservation; not just in terms of science
   content, but also in terms of how students are expected to engage with
   the issues.

TI Teaching Refugee Learners with Interrupted Education in Science:
   Vocabulary, literacy and pedagogy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB With the globalisation of education, large numbers of students with
   interrupted schooling and low English literacy levels represent both a
   quantitative and qualitative shift in the kinds of students faced by
   teachers in classrooms. In Australia, after a year in an intensive
   English language programme, immigrant and refugee students are placed
   in the mainstream, where they face enormous challenges in content areas
   such as science. The complexity and specificity of science terminology
   pose a serious barrier for students. This article reports on a research
   project to support vocabulary learning in mainstream science for Year 8
   refugee students (n = 23) in one high school. Data sources included
   teacher interviews, student journal writing, and the science text
   itself. The author demonstrates why science content language is
   inaccessible to many students through an extensive review of the
   literature, and then juxtaposes the views of students and teachers with
   the actual demands of one chapter from the Year 8 Science textbook on
   states of matter. The final section presents the response of the
   researchers to help scaffold vocabulary learning for this topic and a
   trial of the materials. The study highlights the links between
   conceptual and linguistic understanding. Given that students identified
   vocabulary as a major barrier to learning, and that the science teacher
   tended to assume rather than to explain new terminology, the
   language-focused approach outlined to support vocabulary was seen as
   one way to address an urgent problem. Implications for professional
   development and teacher education are also addressed.

ID CONCEPTIONS; EDUCATION; STUDENTS
AB This paper presents and discusses students' learning process of
   chemical equilibrium from a modelling-based approach developed from the
   use of the 'Model of Modelling' diagram. The investigation was
   conducted in a regular classroom (students 14-15 years old) and aimed
   at discussing how modelling-based teaching can contribute to students
   learning about the main qualitative aspects concerning chemical
   equilibrium. The data (collected from the written material produced by
   the students and the video-recording of the classes) were organised in
   case studies for each group of students. The discussion supports the
   conclusion that elements from the 'Model of Modelling' diagram, as well
   as methodological aspects related to the teacher's action, influenced
   the students' learning process.

ID SCIENCE; MECHANICS
AB Conceptual surveys have become increasingly popular at many levels to
   probe various aspects of science education research such as measuring
   student understanding of basic concepts and assessing the effectiveness
   of pedagogical material. The aim of this study was to construct a valid
   and reliable multiple-choice conceptual survey to investigate students'
   understanding of introductory quantum physics concepts. We examined
   course syllabi to establish content coverage, consulted with experts to
   extract fundamental content areas, and trialled open-ended questions to
   determine how the selected content areas align with students'
   difficulties. The questions were generated and trialled with different
   groups of students. Each version of the survey was critiqued by a group
   of discipline and teaching experts to establish its validity. The
   survey was administered to 312 students at the University of Sydney.
   Using the data from this sample, we performed five statistical tests
   (item difficulty index, item discrimination index, item point biserial
   coefficient, KR-21 reliability test, and Ferguson's delta) to evaluate
   the test's reliability and discriminatory power. The result indicates
   that our survey is a reliable test. This study also provided data from
   which preliminary findings were drawn on students' understandings of
   introductory quantum physics concepts. The main point is that questions
   which require an understanding of the standard interpretations of
   quantum physics are more challenging for students than those grouped as
   non-interpretative. The division of conceptual questions into
   interpretive and non-interpretive needs further exploration.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of a
   simulation-based learning environment on elementary school students'
   (11-12 years old) development of system thinking skills. The learning
   environment included interactive simulations using the Stagecast
   Creator software to simulate the ecosystem of a marsh. Simulations are
   an important tool in any effort to develop system thinking, because
   they have the potential to highlight the dynamic nature of systems.
   Before the implementation of the learning environment (over a period of
   five 90-min lessons) two written tests were administered to the
   students, investigating the development of seven aspects of system
   thinking. The same tests were administered after the implementation.
   Specifically, four of the tasks included in each test were associated
   with skills concerning the structure and the elements of a system and
   three were associated with the processes and interactions taking place
   within a system. The findings indicated that elementary school students
   have the potential to develop system thinking skills. The proposed
   learning environment provoked considerable improvements in some system
   thinking skills during a relatively brief learning process. However,
   the learning environment was not successful in promoting feedback
   thinking. We interpret these results in view of the difficulties
   encountered by the students. We also discuss the implications of our
   findings for the design of learning environments.

AB This US study investigates interactive associations between structure
   in inquiry-type learning activities and academic attainment in high
   school science with introductory college science performance as the
   outcome. Past studies of this type have tended to use smaller samples
   and shorter-range methods of assessing the influence of interactions.
   This study used a large-scale nationally representative sampling of
   science students and investigated the existence of long-range
   associations between high school and college. Replicated across three
   different disciplinary data-sets (biology, chemistry, and physics)
   totaling over 8,000 surveys, the analysis discovered an interaction
   between structure and attainment associated with differences in
   long-range student performance. The implications for these findings in
   terms of theory and practise are discussed in the conclusions.

AB Modelling is a significant aspect of doing physics and it is important
   how this activity is taught. This paper focuses on the explicit or
   implicit messages about modelling conveyed to the student in the
   treatments of phase transitions in statistical mechanics textbooks at
   beginning graduate level. Five textbooks from the 1930s to the present
   are analysed with respect to their messages about the following issues:
   What is a good model? What is the purpose of modelling? What does it
   mean to understand a natural phenomenon? It is argued that these texts
   give the student quite different perceptions of these issues and thus
   what of it means to do physics.

AB Learning objects are interactive web-based tools that support the
   learning of specific concepts by enhancing, amplifying, and/or guiding
   the cognitive processes of learners. Research on the impact,
   effectiveness, and usefulness of learning objects is limited, partially
   because comprehensive, theoretically based, reliable, and valid
   evaluation tools are scarce, particularly in the K-12 environment. The
   purpose of the following study was to investigate a Learning Object
   Evaluation Scale for Students (LOES-S) based on three key constructs
   gleaned from 10 years of learning object research: learning, quality or
   instructional design, and engagement. Tested on over 1100 middle and
   secondary school students, the data generated using the LOES-S showed
   acceptable internal reliability, face validity, construct validity,
   convergent validity and predictive validity.

   about how online instructors give help in ways that lead to increased
   student help seeking and academic success. In this study, we used
   theories and research on learning assistance and scaffolding, teacher
   immediacy, social presence, and academic help seeking to explore
   through a cross-case study design how three online instructors differed
   in their use of cognitive and social supports and how those differences
   related to student perceptions of support, help seeking, and
   performance. Primary data sources included all course postings by the
   instructors, interviews with the instructors, observational field notes
   on course discussions, student interviews, and final student grades.
   Archived course documents and student discussion postings were
   secondary data sources. Data analysis revealed that while all
   instructors provided cognitive and social support, they varied in their
   level of questioning, use of direct instruction, support for task
   structuring, and attention to group dynamics. This variation in
   teaching presence related to differences across the courses in student
   perceptions of support, student help seeking in course discussions, and
   final course grades. Implications for online teaching and suggestions
   for further research are offered.

AB This study was designed to investigate the impact of question prompts
   that guide students to focus on context-related issues when learning
   through cases in an ill-structured domain. Three groups of
   undergraduate students studied cases during a lab-session time period
   using a web-based environment. The first group studied without any
   question prompts. The second group studied the same material while
   prompted to provide written answers to embedded questions in the cases.
   The third group studied while having only to think of possible answers
   for the question prompts. In this study, we explored how the
   questioning intervention affected students' conceptual knowledge of the
   domain and their problem-solving ability. Post-tests did not reveal
   significant statistical differences in the groups' performance,
   indicating that under specific study conditions the prompting impact is
   not traceable in the learning outcomes. This result, however, is
   discussed in the light of a previous study, which showed that this
   context-oriented prompting method had a beneficial effect on student
   learning in a prolonged study-time setting, where students were able to
   self-regulate their study activity.

AB This paper reports on a design-based research (DBR) process for
   designing, implementing, and refining a problem-based learning (PBL)
   course on educational digital video (DV) use and production at the
   University of Lapland's Faculty of Education. The study focuses on the
   students' learning processes and outcomes from the viewpoint of
   meaningful learning. The research subjects included two pilot students
   and ten students enrolled in the course. To promote the reliability of
   the findings, data of various kinds and from multiple sources were
   used, including video recordings of the PBL tutorial sessions. The
   results suggest that PBL offers a good model to support students'
   knowledge and skills in producing and using educational DV. In
   addition, the results suggest that DV production can be used as a
   method to learn about the subject matter of the DVs.

DE PBL; Assessment; Fidelity of implementation; Local adaptations
ID PERFORMANCE
AB Teachers' implementation of a problem-based learning (PBL) program was
   examined to determine both how they assessed student learning and their
   reasons for these assessment practices. Ten 6th grade science teachers
   used Alien Rescue, a computer-based PBL module, with their students for
   approximately three weeks. Interviews, observations, and
   teacher-developed artifacts were analyzed qualitatively. The results
   suggest that assessment-related issues impacted the way that teachers
   implemented this PBL program, with teachers using grades as extrinsic
   motivators, deemphasizing PBL' usual focus on student reflection on
   their process and solutions, and adding assignments to the PBL program
   in order to provide greater structure for students' process and help
   prepare them for standardized tests. Some of these adaptations conflict
   with practices typically advocated in the literature on PBL. The
   implications of these results for the design of PBL programs are
   discussed, with an emphasis on supporting teachers' (a) local
   adaptations of PBL materials and (b) professional development through
   educative components embedded in PBL programs.

AB Troubleshooting skills are integral for the Information Technology
   professional. In order to address faculty concerns that students were
   not effectively learning required troubleshooting skills, a
   standardized troubleshooting methodology (the DECSAR Method) was
   created and integrated into the standard curriculum of a college
   information technology program. Components of troubleshooting were
   measured using a pre-/post-testing approach with the Social Problem
   Solving Inventory-Revised. Testing indicated improvement in several
   areas of troubleshooting reinforced by DECSAR. The context in which the
   troubleshooting methodology was applied was associated with post-test
   change.

AB This paper focuses on the broad outcomes of a research project which
   aimed to analyse and model student teachers' learning in the online
   components of an initial teacher education course. It begins with
   discussion of the methodological approach adopted for the case study,
   which combined conventional data gathering techniques with those which
   are facilitated using the 'panoptical' tools of the VLE. The author has
   synthesized case study evidence, learning theory (Community of practice
   theory) and the advice of a key theoretician, to produce an original
   model of student teachers' learning online within a professional online
   district (POD). The most distinctive feature of the POD model is the
   learning-curriculum dichotomy which recognises the potential of a VLE
   as a venue in which student teachers, working together in a community
   of practice, construct their own curriculum (both formal and
   informal/'hidden'. The paper also examines the key technological and
   pedagogical issues which affect students' online learning. (C) 2008

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of type of
   question prompt and level of prior knowledge on non-routine
   mathematical problem solving. A computer game was blended within the
   pattern reasoning tasks, along with question prompts, in order to
   demonstrate and enhance the connections between viable problem-solving
   strategies and the content knowledge in a visible manner. Seventy-eight
   9th graders from two classes in a public junior high school
   participated in the 6-week experimental instruction. Participants were
   randomly assigned to the specific-prompt group and the general-prompt
   group to receive the one-hour weekly treatment. The results revealed
   that (a) the interaction of question prompts and prior knowledge was
   not significant, and (b) for the problem-solving performances, the
   specific-prompt group outperformed the general-prompt group and the
   high prior-knowledge group outperformed the low prior-knowledge group.
   Further, students receiving specific prompts outperformed those
   receiving general prompts in the problem-solving performance: reasoning
   for two variables. Students with high prior knowledge outperformed
   those with low prior knowledge in the two problem-solving performances:
   reasoning for one variable and reasoning for two variables. It was also
   found that prior knowledge and comprehensive mathematical ability were
   important predictors for the two problem-solving performances:
   reasoning for one variable and reasoning for two variables. However
   question prompts and mathematics attitude were not significant
   predictors for predicting the problem-solving performance of reasoning
   for one variable. Lastly, implications for these results and
   recommendations for future research were discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier

AB In this paper, several recent theoretical conceptions of
   technology-mediated education are examined and a study of 2159 online
   learners is presented. The study validates an instrument designed to
   measure teaching, social, and cognitive presence indicative of a
   community of learners within the community of inquiry (CoI) framework
   [Garrison, D. R., Anderson, T., & Archer, W. (2000). Critical inquiry
   in a text-based environment: Computer conferencing in higher education.
   The Internet and Higher Education, 2, 1-19; Garrison, D. R., Anderson,
   T., & Archer, W. (2001). Critical thinking, cognitive presence. and
   computer conferencing in distance education. American Journal of
   Distance Education, 15(1), 7-23]. Results indicate that the survey
   items cohere into interpretable factors that represent the intended
   constructs. Further it was determined through structural equation
   modeling that 70% of the variance in the online students' levels of
   cognitive presence, a multivariate measure of learning, can be modeled
   based on their reports of their instructors' skills in fostering
   teaching presence and their own abilities to establish a sense of
   social presence. Additional analysis identifies more details of the
   relationship between learner understandings of teaching and social
   presence and its impact on their cognitive presence. Implications for
   online teaching, policy, and faculty development are discussed. (C)

AB This study examines the effects of a computer-assisted learning (CAL)
   program in which syllabic units were highlighted inside words in
   comparison with a CAL program in which the words were not segmented,
   i.e. one requiring whole word recognition. In a randomised control
   trial design, two separate groups of French speaking poor readers (2 *
   14) in first grade were constituted. They were matched on a range of
   reading measures and-non verbal intelligence and trained intensively
   over a short period (10 h over a period of 5 weeks). Three tasks were
   proposed using a classical pre-test/training/post-test design, written
   word recognition, word reading aloud and word spelling. In addition,
   three post-test sessions were conducted: one just after training, one
   after 4 months, and a last one after 9 months. The experimental group
   trained with the CAL using syllabic units outperformed the control
   group using CAL with whole word recognition in all the three tasks and
   there were important lasting effects. The results are discussed in the
   light of the self-teaching hypothesis and phonological recoding. (C)

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the complex relationship
   between students' mathematics confidence, confidence with technology,
   attitude to learning mathematics with technology, affective engagement
   and behavioural engagement, achievement, gender and year level. The
   participants were secondary students from state co-educational schools
   in Metropolitan Athens. Greece. Gender differences as well as
   differences between year levels and the resulting clusters of students
   were investigated by using a MANOVA. It was found that boys expressed
   more positive views towards mathematics and more positive views towards
   the use of technology in mathematics, compared to girls. It was also
   found that high achievement in mathematics was associated with high
   levels of mathematics confidence, strongly positive levels of affective
   engagement and behavioural engagement, high confidence in using
   technology and a strongly positive attitude to learning mathematics
   with technology. Low levels of mathematics achievement was associated
   with low levels of mathematics confidence, strongly negative levels of
   affective engagement and behavioural engagement, low confidence in
   using technology, and a negative attitude to learning mathematics with
   technology. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID GEOLOGY
AB Multidisciplinary courses are being developed at a number of US
   colleges and universities to highlight the connections between the rise
   or fall of world civilizations and the sustainable or unsustainable
   uses of soil and water resources. The content presented in these
   courses is complex because it includes concepts from disciplines as
   varied as geology, soil science, politics, economics, history, and
   anthropology. The learning goals for the courses include developing
   skills in the critical analysis of complex "real-world" problems for
   which there is often no simple or correct solution. Didactic materials
   for such courses are limited. Field trips to sites around the world
   that present some of the issues covered in the course would be ideal,
   but are logistically challenging. We considered that a series of
   virtual field trips (VFTs) to sites around the world would allow us to
   present students with complicated real-world situations, with which to
   practice critical analysis skills. The VFTs envisaged are neither
   tutorials nor field/lab exercises. Rather, they are meant to be
   complex, multi-faceted representations of a past or current
   civilization and how it affects or is affected by its environment. We
   expect that the students will use the VFTs to explore the relationships
   between physical geography and culture and how the decisions or actions
   of a civilization impact natural resources and the environment and thus
   affect its fate. A goal of the VFTs is that through consideration of
   their experiences, students arrive at novel associations that lead to
   dynamic in-class dialogue about the material presented and a deeper
   understanding of the intricacies of the situation in the field. This
   article describes the process of assembling a VFT, and analyzes the
   technological and didactic choices the process requires. Our experience
   with a pilot VFT suggests that no single medium (i.e., video clips,
   interactive maps, animation sequences, etc.) is comprehensive enough to
   meet the course learning goals. Thus, a web-based, open architecture
   format was selected for the VFTs because of its simplicity, flexibility
   and extensibility. Each medium was selected for its ability to support
   the course learning goals. The learning process was mediated by the VFT
   text, questions for thought, and in-class discussions. Preliminary
   results with the pilot VFT are encouraging. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB We are presenting a methodological approach that aims to increase
   students' motivation by asking them to develop tasks based on
   professional settings. In order to meet this objective a collaborative
   methodology was designed and applied to two multidisciplinary projects:
   MARKETOUR and ICT-SLISTOUR. Both projects made students face real
   workplace situations by working collaboratively through the use of a
   virtual learning environment (VLE) and other information technology
   (IT) tools at a national and international level.
   The methodology proposed offers students a professional scenario in
   which they are required to develop purpose-based tasks using IT. A
   virtual learning environment was devised for each project in order to
   create a real learning community and a website was designed in
   ICT-SLISTOUR for sharing information.
   The development of both projects encouraged students to improve their
   communication skills in English as well as their IT skills with the
   ultimate objective of increasing their motivation to learn English for
   specific purposes (ESP). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Our research specifically focuses on the effects of the national
   cultural background of educators on the acceptance and usage of ICT,
   particularly the Web as an extensive and expanding information base
   that provides the ultimate in resource-rich learning. Most research has
   been used North Americans as subjects. For this reason, we interviewed
   European educators from diverse cultures; in particularly, we analysed
   the cultural differences and their moderating effects on
   acceptance-based relationships between European universities: European
   Nordic culture in contrast to European-Mediterranean culture.
   The empirical results provided strong support for the hypotheses.
   Cultural differences have a significant impact on attitudes and
   behaviours towards using Web-based applications. The Nordic culture is
   driven more by instrumental factors and intrinsic enjoyment-based
   factors. On the other hand, the PSG-Mediterranean culture (Portugal,
   Spain and Greece) seems to regard the Web more as a means to a social
   end. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Advances in e-learning technologies parallels a general increase in
   sophistication by computer users. The use of just one theory or model,
   such as the technology acceptance model, is no longer sufficient to
   study the intended use of e-learning systems. Rather, a combination of
   theories must be integrated in order to fully capture the complexity of
   e-learners, who are both system users and learners. The current
   research presents an integrated theoretical framework to study users'
   acceptance of streaming media for e-learning. Three streams of research
   provide the basis for this integrated framework: the technology
   acceptance model, flow theory and media richness theory. Students
   enrolled in an online section of an information systems course used one
   of three different combinations of text, streamed audio and streamed
   video. Regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses in this
   field experiment. Perceived ease of use was a predictor of perceived
   usefulness: both the perceived usefulness and the attitude of the user
   were predictors of intention to use. Richer content-presentation types
   were positively correlated with higher concentration levels but showed
   mixed results when correlated with perceived usefulness. Results from
   this study have practical implications for those interested in
   integrating streaming media into e-learning. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Digital learner portfolios are of growing importance in higher
   education as the sector seeks new teaching-learning-assessment methods
   which promote students' autonomy as managers of their own virtual
   learning environment. The purpose of this study was to analyse
   descriptively the undergraduate students' perceptions, attitudes and
   behaviour when using an eportfolio to support their learning and
   assessment in practice based courses at two traditional Spanish
   universities. The participants were 88 students, who were studying
   through a blended learning mode. Data were collected through
   questionnaires: a computer experience survey, another which examined
   the psychological, pedagogical and technological dimensions of
   eportfolios use. Further, an individual overall reflection was obtained
   from each student to help gain an understanding of their experiences of
   using the eportfolio. A mixed-method analysis was applied in order to
   study the impact of this technological innovation on students and their
   satisfaction. The results showed that the students had positive
   opinions and self-efficiency through the eportfolio as a tool to manage
   their learning and assessment during a semester. especially from the
   second month of use. However, the expected impact on their learning was
   not so significant. Nevertheless, the students emphasised that the
   eportfolio was valuable as a personal developmental learning tool. (C)

AB iTunes University, a website with downloadable educational podcasts,
   can provide students the opportunity to obtain professors' lectures
   when students are unable to attend class. To determine the
   effectiveness of audio lectures in higher education, undergraduate
   general psychology students participated in one of two conditions. In
   the lecture condition. participants listened to a 25-min lecture given
   in person by a professor using PowerPoint slides. Copies of the slides
   were given to aid note-taking. In the podcast condition, participants
   received a podcast of the same lecture along with the PowerPoint
   handouts. Participants in both conditions were instructed to keep a
   running log of study time and activities used in preparing for an exam.
   One week from the initial session students returned to take an exam on
   lecture content. Results indicated that students in the podcast
   condition who took notes while listening to the podcast scored
   significantly higher than the lecture condition. The impact of mobile
   learning on classroom performance is discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The purpose of the study was to examine the role of domain knowledge
   when retrieving and using information from the Internet as a resource
   for essay tasks, as well as to investigate the quality of Internet
   searches and its relation to essay performance. In two experiments. 100
   undergraduates searched the Internet for 30 min and completed two
   essays; one in which they had high domain knowledge and one in which
   domain knowledge was low. Two control groups of 70 undergraduates just
   wrote the essays. Searching the Internet for information enhanced essay
   performance relative to the control groups only for the topic for which
   participants had high domain knowledge. In the second experiment.
   analyses of Internet searches revealed large individual differences in
   search behaviors and these behaviors did not relate to essay
   performance, although individuals highlighted the importance of domain
   knowledge in making their searches easier. Domain knowledge is one
   factor that educators should pay attention to when using the Internet
   for learning tasks, particularly when study time is limited, in order
   to maximize the ability of students to successfully retrieve and use
   information from the Internet. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The purposes of this study were to examine the effects of two types of
   interactive computer simulations and of prior knowledge levels on
   concept comprehension, cognitive load, and learning efficiency.
   Seventy-two 5th grade students were sampled from two elementary
   schools. They were divided into two groups (high and low) based on
   prior knowledge levels, and each group was divided into two treatment
   groups (a low-interactive simulation group and a high-interactive
   simulation group). The dependent variables were concept comprehension,
   cognitive load, and learning efficiency. The results showed that, for
   students with high prior knowledge levels, high-interactive
   simulations, rather than low-interactive simulations, resulted in
   significantly increased comprehension scores, decreased cognitive load
   scores, and higher learning efficiency. On the other hand, among
   students with low prior knowledge levels, the low-interactive
   simulation group did not demonstrate significantly increased
   comprehension scores, but they did show lower cognitive load scores and
   higher learning efficiency than the high-interactive ;simulation group.

AB The aim of this study is to examine and to describe how student
   teachers engaged in courses in web-based learning environments over a
   period of 40-weeks develop a collective competence to collaborate. The
   collective competence of collaboration is defined as the level of
   learning ability a group of students express when using dialogues as a
   tool for their own and other's learning in a web-based learning
   environment. The students' contributions to the course assignments, the
   group responses and the collaborative discussions and dialogues were
   analysed and interpreted based on Bakhtin's and Rommetveit's theories
   on dialogic interactions and meaning potentials. The results describe
   three different levels at which students use dialogues as a tool for
   learning when they collaborate within the group. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although many children are technically skilled in using the Web, their
   competences to use it in a critical and meaningful way are usually less
   well developed. In this article, we report on a multiple case study
   focusing on the possibilities and limitations of collaborative inquiry
   activities as an appropriate context to acquire Web literacy skills in
   primary education. Four 5th grade school teachers and their students
   worked with collaborative inquiry activities on the subject of 'healthy
   food'. The project was aimed at both the development of Web literacy
   skills and content knowledge building. Data from a variety of sources
   were collected: videotaped and written lesson observations, interviews
   with teachers and students, teacher diaries, student questionnaires,
   and student assignments. The teachers appeared to be able to carry out
   the program to varying degrees. Contextual factors that influenced the
   realization of the project's goals and results were the adequacy of the
   research questions formulated by students, students' inquiry skills,
   and the teachers' teaching styles. Students' learning results show that
   it is possible to teach Web literacy skills in the context of
   collaborative inquiry activities. All classes show knowledge gain with
   regard to the subject healthy food and all classes but one show
   knowledge gain with regard to Web literacy skills. Although many
   students show adequate use of particular Web searching, reading and
   evaluating skills after the project, inconsistency, impulsiveness and
   impatience are also typical of their Web behaviour. In the context of
   collaborative inquiry activities teachers are challenged to deal with
   the paradox that they want their students to be active knowledge
   builders with help of the Web, whereas the Web seems to invite students
   to be more or less passive searchers. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This paper aims to determine the effect of conceptual change texts
   accompanied with computer animations on 11th grade students'
   understanding and alternative conceptions related to chemical bonding.
   One experimental group (EG; N = 28) and one comparison group (CC; N =
   30) were used in the study. While the comparison group taught
   traditional instruction, the experimental group received conceptual
   change text accompanied with computer animations instruction. Chemical
   bonding achievement test was applied as pre-test, post-test and delayed
   test to collect data. The results of the study indicated that while
   there is no statistically significant difference between groups in
   pre-test, performance of EG students is greater than the CG ones in
   post-test and delayed test. And also, the EG students are better in
   remediating their alternative conceptions related to chemical bonding.
   Based on the study, it is concluded that conceptual change texts
   combined with computer animations can be effective instructional tools
   to improve students' conceptual understanding of chemical concepts. (C)

AB Is the negative stereotype of women with regard to computer competence
   still exerting power in our society? In this study, 206 participants
   observed a target person (either a woman or a man) on a video who was
   about to solve a complex computer task. Participants had to estimate
   whether the target person was successful on this task in a limited
   amount of time. After they had received the information that the target
   person had solved the task successfully in the required time period,
   and that the person's performance was above average, they were asked to
   provide a reason for the success (luck vs. skill attribution) and to
   evaluate the general computer competence of the target. Then,
   participants had to evaluate their own (hypothetical) computer
   competence in comparison to the target. Results suggest that for the
   direct evaluation of the target persons and for the causal attribution
   of success, no systematic gender-related biases occurred. In the
   self-ratings of participants; however, findings showed that (a) women
   judged their computer competence to be lower than did men, and (b) both
   women and men judged their own hypothetical performance in the
   computer-related task to be relatively higher when comparing it to the
   identically scripted performance of a woman vs. a man. (C) 2008

AB In order to facilitate senior primary school students in Hong Kong to
   engage in learning by observation of the phenomena related to
   electrical circuits, a design of a specific courseware system, of which
   the interactive human-machine interface was created with the use of an
   open-source software called the LabVNC, for conducting online
   remote-controlled experiments was developed in this study. The
   statistically significant results of a pre-test-post-test evaluation
   study showed that the LabVNC-based system has potential to promote
   students to learn the target topic under the approach of learning by
   observation. The assertion of the teacher on the pedagogical value of
   the remote-controlled experimentation and the enthusiasm of students in
   using the LabVNC-based system reveal the potential to integrate the use
   of the LabVNC-based system with the practice of scientific experiments.
   Based on the feedback from the teacher and students, the existing
   LabVNC-based system will be refined under the design-based research
   approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Teaching literacy in inquiry-based science-teaching settings has
   recently become a focus of research in science education. Because
   professional scientists uses of reading, writing, and speaking are
   foundational to their work, as well Lis to nonscientists' comprehension
   of it, it follows that literacy practices should also be central to
   science teaching. Science as a vehicle through which to develop
   literacy skills is an attractive alternative that some teachers choose
   in order to include science in their curriculum. In this paper, we
   present descriptions of three elementary teachers' efforts to teach
   literacy practices through science. Our descriptions, through which we
   illustrate a range of ways in which teachers link science and literacy
   instruction, are grounded in these teachers' accounts and Our
   observations of their teaching. We end with a comparison of these
   teachers' approaches. and draw from this analysis considerations for
   implementing literacy instruction in elementary science education. (c)

TI Rethinking the Notion of Technology in Education: Techno-Epistemology
   as a Feature Inherent to Human Praxis
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE; ISSUES
AB Educators repeatedly underscore the intimate relationship between
   science and technology. This is problematic because technology, far
   from being "applied science," presupposes a unique epistemology
   (techno-epistemology). A focus On the role of science in technology
   overshadows this unique way of knowing and hence limits technology
   education and privileges a scientific worldview in education. To
   appropriately frame the unique epistemology of technology in education,
   we propose a cognitive framework developed to understand the use and
   development of tools in human activity, namely, Cultural-Historical
   Activity Theory (CHAT). Drawing on a case study of technology that is
   not rooted in a (Eurocentric) scientific tradition, the S (X) under bar
   OLE (Reef Net) fishing technology of the (W) under bar SANEC (Saanich)
   people, we show how technology can be understood as inherent to human
   praxis, which presupposes a dialectically related and unique
   epistemology that is incommensurable and irreducible to a scientific
   worldview. The implications of this framework for science and
   technology education are discussed. (c) 2008 Wilely Periodicals, Inc.

ID CURRICULUM
AB This Study examines the historical conditions that fostered significant
   reform in science education. To understand these conditions, we employ
   it framework drawn from the new institutionalism in organization theory
   to Study the founding and early development of the Exploratorium-a
   prominent science center that greatly impacted the field of science
   education. We examine how the Exploratorium employed institutional
   resources that were available in its environment to develop a new type
   of organization: an interactive science center. Our findings reveal
   that the Exploratorium was shaped by the state, which includes all
   levels of government; the mass media; and the professions, including
   science, education, and museums, In addition, we explore the pivotal
   role an individual, Frank Oppenheimer, played in leveraging the
   institutional environment in which an organization was developing. Our
   findings suggest that (a) reform in science education may be more
   profoundly advanced by the development of it new type of organization
   than by "tinkering" with an existing type of organization such as
   schools, and (b) that interactive science centers should exercise
   caution in navigating the changing seas of science education by
   maintaining their core mission and collaborating with new types of
   organizations that arise in response to the changing environment. (c)

ID PROGRAM
AB This qualitative Study examined the perspectives of African American
   parents as it pertained to informal science education. The following
   questions guided this study: (1) What are the desires of African
   American parents/guardians with respect to informal science programs
   and experiences for their children?; (2) What happens in Jordan
   Academy, an enrichment program that has successfully recruited African
   American students? and (3) What are the African American
   parents'/guardians' opinions of the program? We inductively and
   deductively analyzed classroom observations; academy curriculum: photos
   and videotaped class sessions students' written responses to open-ended
   items oil the program's evaluation; and teachers' and parents'
   responses to semistructured, audio-recorded interviews. We viewed the
   analysis results from Boykin's Black Cultural ethos (BCE). We further
   interpreted the Study's findings from a critical Sociocultural
   perspective that employed a model synthesized from Cole's
   cultural-historical framework, Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems
   theory, and Boykin's triple quandary. Results indicated that most of
   the African American parents' desires and opinions align with seven of
   the time dimensions of Bovkin's BCE. The parents' opinions highlight
   the potential impact of culture on parental choice to enroll their
   children into an informal science program. The study has important
   implications tor practices within and research on infomal science
   education. C 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 93:293-321. 2009

TI No Silver Bullet for Inquiry: Making Sense of Teacher Change Following
   an Inquiry-Based Research Experience for Teachers
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID SECONDARY SCIENCE TEACHERS; REFORM; STUDENTS; CLASSROOM; BELIEFS; MODEL
AB Inquiry is seen as central to the reform of science teaching and
   learning, but few teachers have experience with scientific inquiry and
   thus possess very naive conceptions of it. One promising form of
   professional development, research experiences for teachers (RETs),
   allows teachers to experience scientific inquiry in the hopes that
   these experiences will then translate to inquiry in the classroom. As
   intuitively pleasing its these programs are. scant evidence documents
   their effectiveness. For this study, four secondary science teachers
   were followed back to their classrooms following a 6-week, marine
   ecology I RET. The research employed qualitative and quantitative data
   collection to answer these questions: What were the teachers' initial
   conceptions and enactment of classroom inquiry! and how did they change
   after the RET?; How did changes in the nature and use of questions
   highlight changes in inquiry enactment?;: and How were the teachers'
   changes linked to the RET and are there changes that cannot be
   explained by the RET experience? Teachers who entered the program with
   more sophisticated, theory-based understanding of teaching and learning
   were more apt to understand inquiry as a model and to use
   classroom-based inquiry throughout their teaching following the
   program. Implications for professional development are discussed. (c)

ID SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES; CURRICULUM; REFORM;
   DISCOURSE
AB In this article, a rationale for advancing a new idea in humanistic
   science education is developed from a Paulo Freire perspective. Paulo
   Freire developed a well-known approach to adult literacy based oil his
   humanistic ideas through the dialogical process. From Freirean
   educational principles, the idea unfolds that a Freirean humanistic
   science education perspective is a political commitment to
   sociopolitical action, considering conditions of oppression in society.
   Although some humanistic science education approaches to school science
   have incorporated a sociopolitical perspective, it is showed that not
   all of them necessarily focus on the political purpose of transforming
   oppressive conditions in society as stressed by Paulo Freire. From this
   Freirean humanistic perspective, all approach to science education is
   then highlighted, which implies the introduction of socially relevant
   themes and socioscientific issues, the establishment of a dialogical
   process in classroom, and the development of sociopolitical action.
   Hence, a Freirean perspective of science education is presented as a
   radical view of scientific literacy. Some implications of a Freirean
   approach to science education are outlined at the end of the paper. (c)

AB In the study of science topics especially in physics Students are
   expected to move between different modes of representation when dealing
   with a particular concept as any science concept call be represented in
   several different modes. The difficulty for Students is that they are
   often unable to move between these multi-modal representation,.; and
   thus struggle with having a rich conceptual understanding of the topic.
   In this study students are asked to explain their understandings (if
   the topic through writing and embedding different modes of
   representation, text only, text plus math, and text plus graph. A lire
   post test design was used to compare performances of groups who) used
   different modes in their writing during a three-staged unit of
   electricity. While students' scores were not statistically different at
   the end of the first stage, at file end of the stage 2, students who
   were asked to embed mathematical representation in their letters to
   explain concepts of Faraday's Law of Induction had test scores that
   were significantly better than either of the other two conditions. At
   the end of the stage 3 there were several statistical mean differences
   noted supporting the pattern of the advantage of using embedded text
   plus mathematical representation in writings. (C) 2009 Wiley

AB The views on various aspects of the nature of science (NOS) of 179
   novice undergraduate physics students were investigated using six
   open-ended, written probes. These views were consolidated within
   compact NOS "profiles," which were designed based on the students'
   responses to the probes. These profiles may be understood as sets of
   key descriptors, which represented the variation in the views of
   individual students in a succinct way. The views of 86% of the sample
   were found to be represented by four profiles, each containing five
   descriptors. The consequences for the teaching and learning of tertiary
   science, and advantages for linking NOS views to other research

DE physics; metacognition; field trip experiences

AB This article reports on a study that investigated students'
   metacognitive engagement in both out-of-school and classroom settings,
   as they participated in an amusement park physics program. Students
   from two schools that participated in the program worked in groups to
   collectively solve novel physics problems that engaged their individual
   metacognition. Their conversations and behavioral dispositions during
   problem-solving were digitally audio-recorded on devices that they wore
   or placed oil the tables where groups worked on the assigned physics
   problems. The students also maintained reflection journals on the
   strategies they employed to manage their own understanding as well as
   learning processes. Prior to the amusement park physics discourse, the
   Students completed a specially developed questionnaire instrument, This
   provided signposts of the students' metacognitive engagement during
   group problem-Solving at the park and subsequent related physics
   learning tasks back in the classroom. This data, added to field notes
   arising from observations, and formal and informal interviews during
   post-visit learning activities provided the data corpus on the
   students' metacognitive engagement. Analysis of this data revealed
   three types of metacognitive engagement during group learning tasks:
   collaborative and consensus-seeking, highly argumentative, and
   eclectic, resulting from high levels of dissonance. In both cases,
   evidence of individual students' deeper understandings, which
   manifested through students' cognitive and social behaviors,
   demonstrated the invocation of metacognition to varying degrees. The
   novel physics problems tackled by the students created situations where
   discrepancies between their prior knowledge and the direct experiences
   enabled them to explicate their thinking through dispositions of
   behavior. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 46: 265-288,

AB This study investigated the effectiveness of a web-based learning
   environment in enhancing 10th grade high-school students' understanding
   of the concept of chemical bonding. Two groups participated in this
   study: an experimental group (N = 161) and a comparison one (N = 93).
   The teachers in the experimental group were asked to implement four
   activities taken from it website, all dealing with the concept of
   chemical bonding. Computer-based visual models are utilized in all the
   activities in order to demonstrate bonding and the structure of matter,
   and are based on student-centered learning, The study incorporated both
   quantitative and qualitative research. The quantitative research
   consisted of achievement questionnaires administered to both the
   experimental and comparison groups. In contrast, the qualitative
   research included observations and interviews of students and teachers.
   Importantly, we found that the experimental group outperformed the
   comparison group significantly, in the achievement post-test, which
   examines students' understanding of the concept of chemical bonding.
   These results led us to conclude that the web based learning activities
   which integrated visualization tools with active and cooperative
   learning strategies provided students with opportunities to construct
   their knowledge regarding the concept of chemical bonding. (C) 2008

AB Sonic ability to comprehend deep time is it prerequisite for
   understanding macroevolution. This study examines students' knowledge
   of deep time in the context of seven major historical and evolutionary
   events (e.g., the age of the Earth, the emergence of life, the
   appearance of a pre-modern human, Homo habilis). The subjects were 126
   students recruited from psychology, education, and biology classes at
   two universities. They were assigned to stronger and weaker background
   groups based on their college-level biology coursework. Subjects
   provided startlingly large time ranges for all questions, ranging over
   several orders of magnitude (e.g., from 1,000 to 600 billion years ago
   for when most dinosaurs became extinct), coupled with the strong
   tendency to underestimate how long ago the events occurred. Converting
   absolute time estimates to relative time estimates allowed subjects'
   knowledge of the spacing of the events to be examined and also provided
   it clearer picture of their patterns of over and underestimation. The
   results of this study suggest that many students are without an
   effective conceptual framework to make sense of very large time frames.
   Although there were no consistent differences in the accuracy of
   students' responses as a function of their biology background, the
   weaker background students showed greater variability, providing more
   time estimates at both the low and high extremes. We describe a
   pedagogical strategy that uses a relative approach presenting major
   evolutionary events as they unfolded in time and advocate it tool from
   professional practice to depict events in time and space. (C) 2009

AB This qualitative study analyzed grade 12 biology students' answers to
   written extended-response questions that describe hypothetical
   scenarios of animals' evolution. We investigated whether these type of
   questions are suitable for students (n = 24) to express it meaningful
   understanding of evolutionary theory. Meaningful understanding is
   comprised of factual, procedural (rules, algorithms), schematic
   ("knowing why"), and strategic knowledge (when, where and how to apply
   knowledge). Evolutionary theory as a multi-level concept includes
   concepts on three different levels (descriptive, hypothetical, and
   theoretical). Students' answers are examined as to whether they reflect
   the meaningful linking of all concepts through appropriate use of
   scientific language. Results showed that Students (a) predominantly
   linked descriptive concepts and, although expected, IN demonstrated
   only some cross-concept-level links (theoretical-descriptive), (c)
   exhibited even fewer multi-concept-level links
   (theoretical-descriptive-hypothetical), and (d) avoided the linking of
   hypothetical concepts with theoretical ones. All these results showed
   the lack of explanations anti reasoning (absence of schematic and
   strategic knowledge) and knowledge of how to link concepts about
   evolutionary theory meaningfully. The results indicate further that
   written extended-response questions are only partially suitable for
   demonstrating meaningful understanding. Implications for teaching of
   evolutionary theory are discussed. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

AB The aim of this study was to assess the learning effectiveness and
   motivational appeal of a computer game for learning computer memory
   concepts, which was designed according to the curricular objectives and
   the subject matter of the Greek high school Computer Science (CS)
   curriculum, as compared to a similar application, encompassing
   identical learning objectives and content but lacking the gaming
   aspect. The study also investigated potential gender differences in the
   game's learning effectiveness and motivational appeal. The sample was
   88 students, who were randomly assigned to two groups, one of which
   used the gaming application (Group A, N = 47) and the other one the
   non-gaming one (Group B, N = 41). A Computer Memory Knowledge Test
   (CMKT) was used as the pretest and posttest. Students were also
   observed during the interventions. Furthermore, after the
   interventions. students' views on the application they had used were
   elicited through a feedback questionnaire. Data analyses showed that
   the gaming approach was both more effective in promoting students'
   knowledge of computer memory concepts and more motivational than the
   non-gaming approach. Despite boys' greater involvement with, liking of
   and experience in computer gaming, and their greater initial computer
   memory knowledge, the learning gains that boys and girls achieved
   through the use of the game did not differ significantly, and the game
   was found to be equally motivational for boys and girls. The results
   suggest that within high school CS, educational computer games can be
   exploited as effective and motivational learning environments,
   regardless of students' gender, (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This study investigated EFL learners' online reading strategies and the
   effects of strategy use on comprehension. To fulfill the purposes of
   this study, a Web-based reading program, English Reading Online, was
   created. Thirty applied English majors, divided into a high group and a
   low group based on their proficiency levels, were asked to read four
   authentic online texts; two were appropriate to the students' level of
   proficiency, and two were more difficult. Results from data analysis
   showed that the use of support strategies dominated the strategy use
   and contributed to most of the comprehension gains, but an exclusive
   dependence on support strategies did not successfully predict the
   increase in scores on main ideas and details when the students were
   reading more challenging texts. On the whole, the use of global
   strategies significantly contributed to better comprehension,

AB This paper describes an academic experience of podcasting, which
   involved a group of students of a course on multimedia communication
   and human-computer interaction. These students acted both as users of
   the university's podcasting service, and as creators of podcasted
   lessons. A comprehensive analysis based on the evaluation of the
   effects on student performance, on data from student satisfaction
   surveys, from interviews and from instructors' observations provided
   encouraging results: Full-time students co-involved in lessons'
   podcasting outperformed colleagues of the previous years and achieved
   higher levels of what we define as competitive agency, that led them to
   better understand the theoretical issues of the course and to more
   effective practical skills. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pre-laboratory activities have been known to improve students'
   preparation before their practical work as they assist students to make
   available more working memory capacity for actual learning during the
   laboratory. The aim of this investigation was to compare two different
   teaching approaches which supported a pre-laboratory session by using
   the same simulation program. The investigation was conducted in two
   countries (Greece and UK). The Greek students attended the course in a
   computer cluster, where the teacher and the students had a face-to-face
   communication, while the English students participated in the on-line
   WebCT course, where there was an on-line asynchronous discussion. A
   crucial point which emerged from this investigation was that the
   simulation program in the two different pre-laboratory training
   sessions gave the same learning outcome; however, the learning
   characteristics and the teacher's effort were different. Thus, the
   teacher could adopt both the two teaching approaches depending on the
   university facilities, the staffs time and the students' familiarity
   with virtual learning environments. However, in each case of students
   followed a different way (collaboration or/and independent learning) to
   obtain the similar learning outcome. In all cases after their
   pre-laboratory training session they entered the laboratory performing
   the experiments without any further instructions. Additionally, the
   teacher's role was slight difference in the two teaching approaches. In
   the computer cluster, the teacher had a more active role guiding
   students to obtain the expected learning outcome through face-to-face
   discussion and interaction, whereas in the case of the virtual learning
   environment (WebCT), the teacher had a more of a facilitator role
   focused on posing questions to the students and collecting the
   resources promoting the independent learning. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the rapid growth of computer and mobile technology, it is a
   challenge to integrate computer based test (CBT) with mobile learning
   (m-learning) especially for formative assessment and self-assessment.
   In terms of self-assessment, computer adaptive test (CAT) is a proper
   way to enable students to evaluate themselves. In CAT, students are
   assessed through a process that uses item response theory (IRT), a
   well-founded psychometric theory. Furthermore, a large item bank is
   indispensable to a test, but when a CAT system has a large item bank,
   the test item selection of IRT becomes more tedious. Besides the large
   item bank, item exposure mechanism is also essential to a testing
   system. However, IRT all lack the above-mentioned points. These reasons
   have motivated the authors to carry out this study. This paper
   describes a design issue aimed at the development and implementation of
   an adaptive testing system. The system can support several assessment
   functions and different devices. Moreover, the researchers apply a
   novel approach, particle swarm optimization (PSO) to alleviate the
   computational complexity and resolve the problem of item exposure.
   Throughout the development of the system, a formative evaluation was
   embedded into an integral part of the design methodology that was used
   for improving the system. After the system was formally released onto
   the web, some questionnaires and experiments were conducted to evaluate
   the usability, precision. and efficiency of the system. The results of
   these evaluations indicated that the system provides an adaptive
   testing for different devices and supports versatile assessment
   functions. Moreover, the system can estimate students' ability reliably
   and validly and conduct an adaptive test efficiently. Furthermore, the
   computational complexity of the system was alleviated by the PSO
   approach. By the approach, the test item selection procedure becomes
   efficient and the average best fitness values are very close to the
   optimal solutions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The implementation of a computer game for learning about geography by
   primary school students is the focus of this article. Researchers
   designed and developed a three-dimensional educational computer game.
   Twenty four students in fourth and fifth grades in a private school in
   Ankara, Turkey learnt about world continents and countries through this
   game for three weeks. The effects of the game environment on students'
   achievement and motivation and related implementation issues were
   examined through both quantitative and qualitative methods. An analysis
   of pre and post achievement tests showed that students made significant
   learning gains by participating in the game-based learning environment.
   When comparing their motivations while learning in the game-based
   learning environment and in their traditional school environment, it
   was found that students demonstrated statistically significant higher
   intrinsic motivations and statistically significant lower extrinsic
   motivations learning in the game-based environment. In addition, they
   had decreased focus on getting grades and they were more independent
   while participating in the game-based activities. These positive
   effects on learning and motivation, and the positive attitudes of
   students and teachers suggest that computer games can be used as an ICT
   tool in formal learning environments to support students in effective
   geography learning. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, an initial theory of online learning as online
   participation is suggested. It is argued that online learner
   participation (1) is a complex process of taking part and maintaining
   relations with others, (2) is supported by physical and psychological
   tools, (3) is not synonymous with talking or writing, and (4) is
   supported by all kinds of engaging activities. Participation and
   learning are argued to be inseparable and jointly constituting. The
   implication of the theory is straightforward: If we want to enhance
   online learning, we need to enhance online learner participation. (C)

DE Communities of implementation; ICT policy
AB To illustrate the conditions under which successful innovation adoption
   takes place, this paper focuses on the implementation of information
   and communication technologies (ICT) through emerging communities in
   schools. Two types of such communities are described in terms of the
   degree of participation in the implementation: school-wide communities
   and enclaves. The article describes implementation practices in four
   primary schools with reported high ICT use, selected as case-studies.
   Four criteria, reflecting the domain, personnel relationships, policy
   and implementation goals and strategies, as well as staff consistency,
   are employed to outline the existence and types of communities of
   implementation within these schools. Findings indicate that, although
   both school-wide communities and enclaves are present in successful
   schools, enclaves - compared to school-wide communities - are related
   to lower levels of implementation. Based on these findings the authors
   discuss policy directions towards the development of school-wide
   communities as a purposeful implementation strategy to help transition
   ICT institutionalization from the initiation to the habitualization
   stage. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SITUATION AWARENESS
AB In recent years, rapid progress in the use of the internet has resulted
   in huge losses in many organizations due to lax security. As a result,
   information security awareness is becoming an important issue to anyone
   using the Internet. To reduce losses, organizations have made
   information security awareness a top priority. The three main barriers
   to information security awareness are: (1) general security awareness,
   (2) employees' computer skills, and (3) organizational budgets. Online
   learning appears a feasible alternative to providing information
   security awareness and countering these three barriers. Research has
   identified three levels of security awareness: perception,
   comprehension and projection. This paper reports on a laboratory
   experiment that investigates the impacts of hypermedia, multimedia and
   hypertext to increase information security awareness among the three
   awareness levels in an online training environment. The results
   indicate that: (1) learners who have the better understanding at the
   perception and comprehension levels can improve understanding at the
   projection level; (2) learners with text material perform better at the
   perception level; and (3) learners with multimedia material perform
   better at the comprehension level and projection level. The results
   could be used by educators and training designers to create meaningful
   information security awareness materials. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB In an effective e-learning game, the learner's enjoyment acts as a
   catalyst to encourage his/her learning initiative. Therefore, the
   availability of a scale that effectively measures the enjoyment offered
   by e-learning games assist the game designer to understanding the
   strength and flaw of the game efficiently from the learner's points of
   view. E-learning games are aimed at the achievement of learning
   objectives via the creation of a flow effect. Thus, this study is based
   on Sweetser's & Wyeth's framework to develop a more rigorous scale that
   assesses user enjoyment of e-learning games. The scale developed in the
   present study consists of eight dimensions: Immersion, social
   interaction, challenge, goal clarity, feedback, concentration, control,
   and knowledge improvement. Four learning games employed in a
   university's online learning course "Introduction to Software
   Application" were used as the instruments of scale verification. Survey
   questionnaires were distributed to students taking the course and 166
   valid samples were subsequently collected. The results showed that the
   validity and reliability of the scale, EGameFlow, were satisfactory.
   Thus, the measurement is an effective tool for evaluating the level of
   enjoyment provided by e-learning games to their users. (C) 2008

AB Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) is aimed at enhancing
   and supporting the active participation of all students in knowledge
   sharing and knowledge co-construction. In this study, an experimental
   programme was designed to Support students in elaborating and
   justifying their positions in CSCL discussions. The effects of this
   experimental programme on the participation of students as compared to
   their counterparts in a control programme were determined. It was
   hypothesised that special attention to elaboration improves the degree
   and quality of student's participation. The subjects in the study were
   190 students from nine different primary school classes. The results
   both show a main effect on the degree of participation of students in
   the experimental programme and the expected effects of the programme in
   terms of better quality participation. Although the programme aimed at
   enhancing the degree and quality of the participation of all students,
   participation appeared to depend on certain learner characteristics.
   Students from minority backgrounds benefited less than majority
   students from the programme in terms of degree of participation. Boys
   benefited less than girls from the programme in terms of the quality of
   their participation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Web-based learning environments are becoming increasingly popular in
   higher education. one of the most important web-learning resources is
   the virtual laboratory (VL), which gives students an easy way for
   training and learning through the Internet. Moreover, on-line
   collaborative communication represents a practical method to transmit
   the knowledge and experience from the teacher to students overcoming
   physical distance and isolation. Considering these facts, the authors
   of this document have developed a new dynamic collaborative e-learning
   system which combines the main advantages of virtual laboratories and
   collaborative learning practices. In this system, the virtual
   laboratories are based on Java applets which have embedded simulations
   developed in Easy Java Simulations (EJS), an open-source tool for
   teachers who do not need complex programming skills. The collaborative
   e-learning is based on a real-time synchronized communication among
   these Java applets. Therefore, this original approach provides a new
   tool which integrates virtual laboratories inside a synchronous
   collaborative e-learning framework. This paper describes the main
   features of this system and its successful application in a distance
   education environment among different universities from Spain. (C) 2008

AB This paper reports on a failed experiment to use Wiki technology to
   support student engagement with the subject matter of a third year
   undergraduate module. Using qualitative data, the findings reveal that
   in an educational context, social technologies such as Wiki's, are
   perceived differently compared with ordinary personal use and this
   discourages student adoption. A series of insights are then offered
   which help HE teachers understand the pitfalls of integrating social
   technologies in educational contexts. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

ID FRAMEWORK
AB There is a wealth of evidence that collaboration between learners can
   enhance the outcomes for all concerned. This supports the theorization
   of learning as a socio-cultural practice, framed by Vygotsky and
   developed by other researchers such as Rogoff, Lave and Wenger.
   However, there is also evidence that working collaboratively may not be
   a spontaneous response to working in a group, and that teaching
   learners how to collaborate, and in particular how to work together to
   negotiate meaning, is a necessary part of the process of learning
   collaboratively which can enhance outcomes further. A question for the
   computer supported collaborative learning community then arises as to
   whether learning to collaborate can be scaffolded through the use of
   digital tools, and what such tools might look like. This paper reports
   on the design of a digital system that aims to support the practice of
   face-to-face collaboration on open-ended tasks. Findings from trials of
   the system in classrooms in the UK and Chile show that the model is
   welcomed both by teachers and pupils, and met its objectives of
   ensuring greater interaction between class members who did not normally
   work together, and involvement of all individuals in discussion based
   activities. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, several issues regarding the epistemology of
   technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) are first raised for
   the purpose of clarifying the construct. Specifically, the
   transformative and integrative views are juxtaposed for exploring the
   epistemology of TPCK, and, at the end, the transformative view is
   adopted concluding that TPCK is a unique body of knowledge that is
   constructed from the interaction of its individual contributing
   knowledge bases. Then, ICT-TPCK is introduced as a strand of TPCK, and
   is described as the ways knowledge about tools and their affordances,
   pedagogy, content, learners, and context are synthesized into an
   understanding of how particular topics that are difficult to be
   understood by learners or difficult to be represented by teachers can
   be transformed and taught more effectively with technology in ways that
   signify its added value. One model for the development and another for
   the assessment of ICT-TPCK are then discussed. Technology Mapping is
   proposed as a situative methodology for the development of ICT-TPCK,
   and three forms of assessment, namely, expert assessment, peer
   assessment, and self-assessment are proposed for assessing teachers'
   competencies to teach with technology. The paper also reports on the
   empirical findings of a study that was undertaken to investigate the
   impact of the proposed models on student learning within the context of
   two design tasks in a pre-service primary teacher education course.
   Repeated measures within-subject effects were tested and the results
   indicated that ICT-TPCK competency significantly improved over the
   course of a semester. The results of this study clearly show that the
   theoretical models proposed herein can positively impact the
   development of ICT-TPCK. Lastly, these results can be used as baseline
   data in future studies that may be conducted to further validate or
   improve the proposed models in different contexts. (C) 2008 Elsevier

AB This paper presents an evaluation case study that describes the
   experiences of 15 students and 2 teachers using a video-based learning
   environment, DiViDU, to facilitate students' daily reflection
   activities in a composition course and a ballet course. To support
   dance students' reflection processes streaming video was applied as
   follows: video editing and viewing for facilitating students in
   describing their practice; writing online self-assessments about the
   experiences captured on video to support students in evaluating their
   practice; online peer-feedback activities concerning the recorded
   practice for facilitating students in learning from multiple
   perspectives. In the composition course eight students reflected on
   their choreographic work, which was performed by their peer students.
   In the ballet course seven students reflected on themselves practicing
   the ballet technique. Data about the streaming video facilitation were
   collected after the completion of the reflection assignments using
   semi-structured interviews. The results revealed that students in both
   courses considered steaming video as effective for carrying out
   self-evaluations. The usefulness of video and online peer-feedback for
   other reflection processes differed among the courses in students'
   view. The teachers considered streaming video generally useful for all
   the reflection processes of their students; however they also indicated
   some shortcomings. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents an empirical micro-simulation model of the teaching
   and the testing process in the classroom (Programs and sample data are
   available - the actual names of pupils have been hidden). It is a
   non-econometric micro-simulation model describing informational
   behaviors of the pupils, based on the observation of the pupils'
   communication behavior during lessons and tests. The representation of
   the knowledge process is very simplified. However, we tried to study
   the involvements of individual motivation, capability and relationship
   with other pupils of each pupil, to compare them to the new-classical
   (and keynesian) and Austrian information and knowledge theoretical
   results. It is a first step and future development should concern
   expectation behaviors and dynamics. This paper aims too to give, we
   hope so, some criteria of pupils' rationality in the classroom. (C)

AB This paper describes the motivation, proposal, and early prototype
   testing of a computer tool for story visualisation. An analysis of
   current software for making various types of visual story is made; this
   identifies a gap between software which emphasises preset banks of
   artwork, and software which emphasises low-level construction and/or
   drawing. A proposal is made to fill this gap, and a prototype
   implementation of the proposal is described in the context of a
   school-based study with England and Wales's Year 5, covering ages 9-10
   years. Results from this prototype study both validate the novel
   proposal made and demonstrate that children are capable of manipulating
   characters and notional camera angles in a more complex way than most
   current software permits. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated how female elementary education pre-service
   teachers in the United States, Turkey and Taiwan learned spatial skills
   from structured activities involving discrete, as opposed to
   continuous, transformations in interactive computer programs, and how
   these activities transferred to non-related standardized tests of
   spatial visualization and mental rotation. The study used a pretest,
   intervention, posttest research design with experimental and comparison
   groups. The experimental group participated in transformational
   geometry visualization exercises, once a week for six weeks, for
   approximately 20 minutes each session. Instruments were standardized
   measures of spatial visualization and mental rotation; intervention
   activity worksheets directed the participants through 2D and 3D
   transformational geometry tasks in computer environments. For Turkish
   and Taiwanese participants, the experimental group improved
   significantly more than the control group in spatial visualization,
   while the American participants showed no such significant improvement.

AB This paper reports the results of a study of the extent to which
   processes and procedures from the discipline of project management can
   scaffold online project-based learning in a graduate-level
   instructional technology course, by facilitating intra-team
   interaction, enhancing project outcomes and promoting a positive
   project team experience. With one course section using tools and
   templates from project management and one section using only free-form
   text forms and instructor guidelines as project scaffolding tools, team
   interactions were compared via qualitative and quantitative analyses of
   team threaded discussions over an 8-week project lifecycle. Project
   outcomes were assessed by comparing project product scores using the
   t-test for independent samples, while project experience was assessed
   via a post-project survey using the University of Wisconsin-Madison
   Student Assessment of Learning Gains (SALG) questionnaire. Results
   indicate that the project management methodology facilitates intra-team
   communication and positive collaborative behavior, but is not a
   critical factor for final product quality. The results provide a
   starting point for educators and researchers seeking to assess
   cross-disciplinary approaches to project-based learning. (C) 2008

AB Video games and new communication metaphors are quickly changing
   today's young people habits. Considering the actual e-learning
   scenarios, embedded in a fully technological enabled environment it is
   crucial to take advantage of this kind of capabilities to let learning
   process gain best results.
   This paper presents a virtual campus created using Second Life which
   provides four distinct types of virtual space: common student campus,
   collaborative zones, lecture rooms and recreational areas. Second Life
   environments and objects have been designed and programmed to support
   synchronous lectures and collaborative learning. The Second Life
   virtual world has also been equipped with supporting tools enabling
   students and teachers to navigate among multimedia contents. Second
   Life and an ad-hoc developed Moodle plug-in have been integrated to
   naturally enrich the environment with LMS services, exploiting this 3D
   world to increase the interaction and communication opportunities
   between teachers and students, and among students, principally favoring
   planned and unplanned social encounters.
   We have conducted an experiment involving university students aiming at
   evaluating Second Life synchronous distance lectures in the proposed
   learning environment. The evaluation has been conducted considering
   that, in a 3D multi-user virtual environment, learning is strongly
   related to the user perception of belonging to a learning community, as
   well as to the perception of awareness, presence and communication. The
   results of the evaluation are very positive. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The World Wide Web (WWW) has become the biggest information source for
   students while solving information problems for school projects. Since
   anyone can post anything on the WWW, information is often unreliable or
   incomplete, and it is important to evaluate sources and information
   before using them. Earlier research has shown that students have
   difficulties with evaluating sources and information. This study
   investigates the criteria secondary educational students use while
   searching the Web for information. 23 students solved two information
   problems while thinking aloud. After completing the tasks they were
   interviewed in groups on their use of criteria. Results show that
   students do not evaluate results, source and information very often.
   The criteria students mention when asked which criteria are important
   for evaluating information are not always the same criteria they
   mention while solving the information problems. They mentioned more
   criteria but also admitted not always using these criteria while
   searching the Web. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of the study was to investigate how web-based technology
   could be utilized and integrated with real-life scientific materials to
   stimulate the creativity of secondary school students. One certified
   science teacher and 31 seventh graders participated in this study.
   Several real-life experience science sessions integrated with online
   teaching were used for one semester. The study used an interpretive
   methodology. which was qualitative analysis rather than quantitative
   analysis. The main data included students' online data, interviews,
   videotape recordings and the teacher's journals. The results also
   showed that this study provided information to enhance students'
   expression of sensitivity, fluency, flexibility, originality, and
   elaboration of scientific creativities. Students' creativity was
   motivated by the online interactivities and the teacher's inquiry. The
   difficulties and limitations of the teaching and learning environment
   included strong attraction toward the Internet, poor ability of
   students in word processing and discussion online, students'
   utilitarianism due to the pressure of entrance examination, and large
   amount of time spent on explorative activities. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Current trends clearly indicate that online learning has become an
   important learning mode. However, no effective assessment mechanism for
   learning performance yet exists for e-learning systems. Learning
   performance assessment aims to evaluate what learners learned during
   the learning process. Traditional summative evaluation only considers
   final learning outcomes, without concerning the learning processes of
   learners. With the evolution of learning technology, the use of
   learning portfolios in a web-based learning environment can be
   beneficially adopted to record the procedure of the learning, which
   evaluates the learning performances of learners and produces feedback
   information to learners in ways that enhance their learning.
   Accordingly, this study presents a mobile formative assessment too[
   using data mining, which involves six computational intelligence
   theories, i.e. statistic correlation analysis, fuzzy clustering
   analysis, grey relational analysis, K-means clustering, fuzzy
   association rule mining and fuzzy inference, in order to identify the
   key formative assessment rules according to the web-based learning
   portfolios of an individual learner for the performance promotion of
   web-based learning. Restated, the proposed method can help teachers to
   precisely assess the learning performance of individual learner
   utilizing only the learning portfolios in a web-based learning
   environment. Hence, teachers can devote themselves to teaching and
   designing courseware, since they save a lot of time in measuring
   learning performance. More importantly, teachers can understand the
   main factors influencing learning performance in a web-based learning
   environment based on the interpretable learning performance assessment
   rules obtained. Experimental results indicate that the evaluation
   results of the proposed scheme are very close to those of summative
   assessment results and the factor analysis provides simple and clear
   learning performance assessment rules. Furthermore, the proposed
   learning feedback with formative assessment can clearly promote the
   learning performances and interests of learners. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Submicrorepresentations (SMR) could be an important element, not only
   for explaining the experimental observations to students, but also in
   the process of evaluating students' knowledge and identifying their
   chemical misconceptions. This study investigated the level of students'
   understanding of the solution concentration and the process of
   dissolving ionic and molecular crystals at particulate level, and
   identifies possible misconceptions about this process. Altogether 408
   secondary school students (average age 16.3) participated in the study.
   The test of chemical knowledge was applied and the analysis of four
   selected problems related to drawing SMRs in solution chemistry is
   presented. Selected students were also interviewed in order to gain
   more detailed data about their way of solving problems comprised in the
   knowledge test. The average achievement on solution chemistry items was
   only 43%. It can be concluded from the results that students have
   different misconceptions about arrangements of solute particles in the
   solution and presentation of its concentration at particulate level.
   Students show quite low achievement scores on the problem regarding
   drawing the SMR of ionic substance aqueous solution (7.6% correct
   answers) and even lower ones on the problem regarding drawing the SMR
   of diluted and saturated aqueous solutions of molecular crystal (no
   completely correct answers). It can be also concluded that many
   different misconceptions concerning the particulate level of basic
   solution chemistry concepts can be identified. In the conclusion some
   implications for teaching to reach a higher level of understanding of
   solution chemistry are proposed.

AB This paper reports on the development, self-critique and evolution of
   research methods for interpreting and understanding students'
   metacognition that were developed through the Metacognition and
   Reflective Inquiry (MRI) collaborative study. The MRI collaborative was
   a multi-year, multi-case, research study that investigated the elusive
   nature and character of high school students' metacognition across
   formal and informal science learning contexts. The study's research
   design comprised a series of integrated, layered, interpretive case
   studies which were conducted in a hermeneutic fashion over a 3 year
   period. The implementation of each case study provided an opportunity
   for the researchers to reflect critically on the research methods used
   to elucidate metacognition and hence refine the individual and
   collective capacity, responsiveness and fruitfulness of the methods
   used. This paper discusses the evolution of these methods and the
   lessons that the entire study provides for the conceptualization of
   other qualitative-interpretivist studies.

AB Within the enterprise of science and technology centres there exists
   explicit aims and ambitions to enhance visitors' interest in and
   knowledge about science. Meanwhile, several researchers question the
   choice of the scientific content in exhibitions when arguing that a too
   unproblematic view of science commonly is presented. But how do staff
   members consider what scientific content to include and how this
   content can be organised in exhibitions? The results from interviews of
   staff members, responsible for planning and creating new exhibitions,
   suggest that they consider the scientific content of their exhibitions
   to a high extent in terms of organizational matters. This means that
   the staff members tend to not consider discussions about what aspects
   of science to include or exclude. Further on, the results imply that
   the relation between science and society risk being implicit to the
   visitors, whereas the aspect of scientific processes tend to be
   overlooked when constructing new exhibitions. The staff members express
   an anxiety in displaying scientific uncertainties or different models
   of explanations when arguing that this risks confusing the visitors.
   However, these aspects of science are, in the field of science
   education, considered crucial in order to create curiosity and interest
   in science. Does this mean that science and technology centres, through
   their eagerness to enhance young visitors' scientific literacy, risk
   contributing to their detachment from or unconcern for scientific
   issues?.

AB Scientifically literate citizens would be empowered to think critically
   about the role of science in society and use it as a tool for informed
   decision making and problem solving in a rapidly changing and
   developing world. In this study, scientific literacy was viewed as an
   attribute both industry and the general community could reasonably
   expect from higher education's graduates. As such, this mixed methods
   research aimed to identify, document and represent concretely through a
   rope metaphor the development of scientific literacy amongst a sample
   of 244 first year university students.

AB Lifelong science literacy begins with attitudes and interests
   established early in childhood. The use of trade books (i.e., a
   literary work intended for sale to the general public) in North
   American school classrooms to support the development of science
   literacy invites an examination of the quality of science content
   disseminated to students. A total of 116 trade books were examined to:
   (a) determine the degree to which science trade books complement
   expected science knowledge outcomes outlined in school curricula, and
   (b) compare trade book content to the goals of scientific literacy.
   Analysis across four science topics, Dinosaurs, Space, Inheritance, and
   Growth and Life Properties, revealed that this body of children's
   literature is inconsistent in its coverage of curricular goals and
   elements of scientific literacy. Because trade books represent
   children's first exposure to science, these shortcomings should be
   addressed if these books are to be maximally effective in promoting
   science literacy. Implications for using trade books in the classroom
   are discussed.

ID PROGRAM; INQUIRY
AB The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) has
   declared in an advertising campaign that "you can't start young enough"
   in science. However, there is no long-term data evaluating the effect
   of early exposure to original scientific research on producing career
   scientists. To address this issue, we examined a hands-on summer
   science research program for high school students that ran from 1958 to
   1972. We compared participants in that program with science students
   that only began their hands-on research experience once in university.
   Our data indicate that students who are interested in science and have
   an opportunity to participate in original scientific research while in
   high school are significantly more likely (p < .005) to both enter and
   maintain a career in science compared to students whose first research
   experience didn't occur until university. Our data suggest that more
   hands-on high school science research programs could help increase the
   number of students entering and maintaining scientific careers,
   relieving the growing concern that North America is losing its
   leadership status in the international scientific community.

AB This research focuses on use of a triadic teaching approach in a
   science-technology-society (STS) course designed for future science
   teachers for middle schools in Turkey. Forty-three pre-service science
   teachers were enrolled in a semester-long course organized around
   issues students identified and used throughout the semester. The
   triadic teaching approach includes library-online searches that lead
   the students to design and conduct investigations, to carrying out
   mini-scientific symposia, and to preparing and conducting poster
   presentations open to the entire student body and faculty. The results
   of a 30-item Likert scale, administered to the students as a pretest
   and a posttest, indicated that there were significant increases in
   positive attitudes towards STS issues from the beginning to the end of
   the study. Individual interviews were also conducted with the students
   to determine the individual effects of each component of the triadic
   teaching approach on their attitudes towards STS issues. All aspects of
   the new approach provided significant contributions to the development
   of more positive attitudes among the students towards STS via
   interviews and on all sub-scales of a survey administered that include:
   (1) pupil interest in STS issues; (2) teacher interest in STS issues;
   (3) general perceptions regarding importance of STS issues.

AB In recent times there has been an enormous interest in Vygotsky's
   writing on conceptual development, particularly his insights on the
   differences between everyday and scientific thinking. In drawing upon
   cultural-historical theory, this paper seeks to examine the relations
   between everyday concepts and scientific concepts within playful
   contexts, such as preschools, with a view to better understanding how
   very young children develop conceptual understandings in science. This
   paper presents an overview of a study which sought to map the
   transformation and appropriation of scientific concepts within two
   early childhood settings. Approximately ten weeks of data gathering
   took place, with video recordings, field notes, photographic
   documentation, and child and teacher interviews for recording child
   concept formation within these naturalistic settings. The findings
   indicate that when teacher programs are more oriented towards concepts
   rather than materials, children's play is focused on conceptual
   connections. Importantly, the study showed that: It was possible to map
   the multiple and dynamic levels or stratas of thinking that a child or
   group of children may exhibit within play-based contexts; An analysis
   of 'unorganised heaps' and 'complexive thinking' evident in
   conceptually or materially oriented play-based programs can be
   determined; the dialectical relations between everyday concepts and
   scientific concepts in play-based programs can be understood; and
   greater understanding about the nature of concept formation in situated
   playful contexts have been possible.

DE Visualisation; Drawing; Elementary education
AB It is in the visualisation of ideas, and the expression or
   representation of our ideas, that we can bring something more clearly
   into consciousness. A drawing might be seen as an externalisation of a
   concept or idea. Drawing has the potential to play a mediating role in
   the visualisation of ideas and concepts in relation to young children
   exploring scientific concepts. This paper explores how drawing and
   visualisation bridges the gap between perception-bound thinking and
   more abstract, symbolical thinking. It demonstrates how drawing, and
   the related visualisation that results from drawing, helped children to
   construct meaning for themselves as well as share their ideas with
   others and across contexts. A socio-cultural framework is used to
   examine the dialogic engagement with drawing in relation to young
   children's exploration of scientific ideas. Drawing and visualisation
   can assist young children in their shift from everyday, or spontaneous
   concepts, to more scientific concepts. Drawing also assists young
   children's interactions and competencies with spatial visualisations,
   interpretations, orientations and relations. When young children are
   able to create visual representations of their ideas they are then more
   able to work at a metacognitive level. When children are encouraged to
   revisit, revise and dialogue through and with their drawing they are
   able to represent and explore increasingly complex ideas.

AB Bodily manipulations, such as juggling, suggest a well-synchronized
   physical interaction as if the person were a physics expert. The
   juggler uses knowledge that is rooted in bodily experience, to interact
   with the environment. Such enacted bodily knowledge is powerful,
   efficient, predictive, and relates to sensory perception of the
   dynamics of objects. This paper describes results of an empirical study
   in physics learning, aimed at exploring links between sensory input,
   visual representations, and corresponding conceptual learning in
   physics. The central finding is that through sensory interaction (e.g.,
   touch, vision) with a physical system in the physics laboratory,
   learners spontaneously generate a novel reference-system of pictorial
   representations, typical to the situation explored. Results show that
   in collaborative hands-on problem-solving in physics, a pictorial
   referential communication system is generated. Elements of the
   pictorial communication system were found to be one of three:
   photographic, metaphoric, or symbolic. The constituents of the
   communication system are socially shared, hence valid, are used
   repeatedly when similar experience happens, therefore consistent. Thus
   visual-spatial representations of non-explicit knowledge turn into
   pictorial representations for communication. It is powerful because it
   allows access and retrieval of tacit knowledge, inaccessible by
   symbolic interaction.

AB Geologists and undergraduate students observed eight artificial rock
   outcrops in a realistically scaled field area, and then tried to
   envision a geological structure that might plausibly be formed by the
   layered rocks in the set of outcrops. Students were videotaped as they
   selected which of fourteen 3-D models they thought best represented the
   geological structure and then explained their choice. The focus of this
   paper is on how students reasoned from observations to inferences.
   Students used observations of outcrops' location, steepness (dip),
   orientation (strike), stratigraphy, and placement relative to
   topography to infer whether the structure was convex or concave, deep
   or shallow, symmetrical or asymmetrical, open or closed, and elongate
   or circular. On average, science majors produced more than twice as
   many evidence-supported claims than did non-science majors. Science
   majors produced more valid lines of reasoning than did non-science
   majors, and students who selected a correct model produced more valid
   lines of reasoning than students who selected an erroneous model.
   Apparent challenges included identifying appropriate observational
   evidence, combining multiple lines of reasoning, and understanding the
   scale relationship between candidate models and the full-scale
   structure.

AB In this study, we examine how subjects set up, transform, and reason
   with models that they establish on the basis of known facts as they
   seek to explain a familiar everyday phenomenonthe phases of the moon.
   An interview schedule was designed to elicit subjects' reasoning, and
   in the case where explanations were mistaken, to induce a change in
   explanation. Detailed interviews of eight participants were videotaped
   and their reasoning analysed to highlight the difficulties encountered,
   the interaction between physical and geometrical aspects,
   simplification and idealisation processes, interplay between facts,
   concepts and visualisation, and the use of external visualisations
   through gestures and diagrams. We suggest that visualisation is an
   important process in science learning, and point to the importance of
   developing among students the ability to work with diagrams.

AB Interactive simulations are entering mainstream science education.
   Their effects on cognition and learning are often framed by the legacy
   of information processing, which emphasized amodal problem solving and
   conceptual organization. In contrast, this paper reviews simulations
   from the vantage of research on perception and spatial learning,
   because most simulations take a spatial format and the pedagogical
   intent is to promote learning. Four learning effects help clarify the
   positive and negative aspects of current simulation designs: picture
   superiority, noticing, structuring, and tuning.

AB This paper explores the role of diagrams and text in middle school
   students' understanding and visualisation of human body systems. We
   develop a common framework based on structure and function to assess
   students' responses across diagram and verbal modes. Visualisation is
   defined in terms of understanding transformations on structure and
   relating these with function. We found in Indian students a high
   dependence on the verbal mode. Students expressed structure as well as
   function concepts significantly better through text rather than
   diagrams. Prior knowledge strongly influenced visualisation (as
   assessed through transformations) and comprehension of text and
   diagrams including the ability to move flexibly between text and
   diagrams. We suggest better use of line drawings for integrating
   structure and function: practices that should equip the learner to
   dual-code text with diagrams, thereby leading to enhanced understanding
   and expression.

AB The ability to visualize in three dimensions is a cognitive skill that
   has been shown to be important for success in engineering and other
   technological fields. For engineering, the ability to mentally rotate
   3-D objects is especially important. Unfortunately, of all the
   cognitive skills, 3-D rotation abilities exhibit robust gender
   differences, favoring males. The assessment of 3-D spatial skills and
   associated gender differences has been a topic of educational research
   for nearly a century; however, a great deal of the previous work has
   been aimed at merely identifying differences. The author has been
   conducting applied research in the area of spatial skills development
   for more than a decade aimed at identifying practical methods for
   improving 3-D spatial skills, especially for women engineering
   students. This paper details the significant findings obtained over the
   past several years through this research and identifies strategies that
   appear to be effective in developing 3-D spatial skills and in
   contributing to student success.

   synergy
AB The history of educational development is rooted in the improvement of
   teaching techniques. As a result, centres or units have normally been
   located in central registrars or human resources departments, library,
   learning and technical support services, or established as
   semi-autonomous entities. The alignment of educational development with
   research at a teaching-led UK university marks a radical departure from
   these established patterns. The paper will explore some principles for
   the development of synergy between teaching and research through
   presenting the conceptual and strategic case for locating educational
   development in a university-wide Graduate School. This includes
   institutional commitment to renewing research capacity and the
   acceptance of a holistic model of academic practice and re-shaping of
   academic identity through strengthening the links between research and
   teaching via professional development. Three different approaches to
   bridging the cultural gap between teaching and research are compared

TI 'To develop research skills': Honours programmes for the changing
   research agenda in Australian universities
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE research training; curriculum
AB Within Australian universities the results of Honours have
   traditionally been used as the main entry requirement for a research
   degree and as a means of ranking for research scholarships. But despite
   the critical role of Honours, there has been little research about
   Honours. There is an untested assumption that universities offering
   Honours programmes, staff teaching them, and students undertaking them
   share common assumptions about their purpose. To test this assumption
   the researchers undertook an initial study across five Australian
   universities in two different disciplines, to identify the extent to
   which staff and students in different disciplines and different
   universities held varying views about the purpose of the Honours.
   Honours coordinators and students in the sample universities were
   interviewed and Honours information for the universities examined.
   Results indicate that indeed the aims of an Honours programme and the
   reasons for enrolling in Honours do vary. However, more significantly,
   there have been identifiable changes in the structure and nature of
   Honours programmes over recent years that may not support some of the
   traditionally held views of Honours, particularly as a selection
   mechanism for enrolment in, and scholarship ranking for, higher degrees
   by research.

AB The major purpose of this case article is to propose a methodology for
   reporting the work of teachers who develop ICT-facilitated learning, so
   that it is publishable in refereed journals. This experience of
   professional practice typically fails to meet the criteria of academic
   research, yet academics are experienced investigators and are skilled
   at evaluation. Hence the precedent of medical research where experience
   can be reported is seen to provide a model. As long as the method of
   reporting practice is appropriate, in due course others can analyse
   collections of case studies (cases study research), and in the longer
   term we can look forward to meta-studies where collections of case
   studies are analysed.

DT Article

ID SITUATED COGNITION; CURRICULUM
AB Few students in pursuit of baccalaureate business degrees seem to have
   spent significant time in organisations of the kind studied and
   discussed in the courses that typify such degrees. This paper questions
   the extent to which the students' lack of business exposure is
   perceived by teachers as a barrier to effective learning and teaching.
   It suggests that learning and teaching would be enhanced for all
   stakeholders if students experienced the real-life complexities of
   actual organisations either before, or in the early part, of their
   degree programmes. This would serve the dual purpose of allowing the
   students to better comprehend the taught content as it relates to real
   life, while continuing to enhance their eventual employability in the
   same way that many existing placement schemes aim to do.

SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL

DT Article
DE internationalisation; curriculum design; embedding skills; policy and
   implementation
AB As the numbers of international students attending UK universities
   increases, so the need grows to address the internationalisation agenda
   in a variety of ways. Much of what has been written in this area has
   been focused at the level of institutional and national policy and
   strategy. We argue here that this focus has tended to obscure the issue
   at the teaching and learning level, which is where students and
   teachers actually experience internationalisation, and because of its
   central importance, teaching and learning must be addressed explicitly
   alongside policy and strategic perspectives; otherwise there is a
   danger of a gap forming between policy and implementation. We describe
   several ways in which an aspect of internationalisation, i.e.
   supporting students' learning, is addressed through curriculum design
   which takes into account the international student population of many
   courses.

AB Using experiential simulation games is a commonly used pedagogical
   method to enrich classroom discussions and to facilitate students'
   learning in supply chain management education at both undergraduate and
   graduate levels. However, existing games are inappropriate for
   undergraduate students that are first-time learners of the subject. In
   this paper, we describe a discovery-based laboratory that is developed
   to supplement an undergraduate introductory operations management
   course when the fundamentals of supply chain management are taught. The
   detailed description of the lab and the assessment results of student
   learning effectiveness based on a rubric technique are provided. We
   also compare the student performance with and without the lab in terms
   of understanding the general aspects of supply chains. In addition, we
   comment on the limitations and possible expansions of the lab.

ID POWERPOINT
AB This paper describes a teaching experiment involving the use of a
   combination of traditional chalkboard and digital photography in order
   to produce lecture notes from the blackboard. During lecturing the
   blackboard is used instead of transparencies or PowerPoint
   presentations. This reduces the speed of presentation and leaves room
   for improvisations during the lecturing but hand-outs of slides are not
   readily available. As an experiment, the blackboards were photographed
   after each lecture and notes were prepared from the photos. An
   investigation of the students' response to this approach indicated that
   it was very well received and it provides a useful alternative to
   PowerPoint with hand-outs. It is a low-cost alternative to advanced
   interactive whiteboards which are in most cases not available in
   university lecture rooms.

AB An important facet of effective Web-based instructional design is the
   consideration of learning activities to stimulate students' learning
   motivation. In order to create a motivating interaction environment,
   the design of motivational strategies to foster student interest in
   learning is essential. The study employed Keller's ARCS Motivational
   Model (focusing on Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction)
   in the design and implementation of a Web-based lesson. Co-operative
   learning activities and a task-oriented approach were used to augment
   students' learning motivation. During the implementation process,
   motivational problems were analysed, and instructional adjustment was
   made. Various data sources were used in order to assess students'
   learning and motivation. The ARCS Model was used as the main theme in
   summarising the motivational approach in the Web-based learning
   activities. Overall, students were positive about the innovative
   learning approach.

AB This study implemented an online peer assessment activity to help 52
   Taiwanese in-service science and mathematics teachers to develop
   research proposals in an educational research course. The participants
   were divided into 16 groups, and each group was required to submit a
   proposal via three rounds of online peer-assessment activity. This
   study found that, through the online peer-assessment activity, the
   in-service teachers could enhance their proposals at the initial stage
   of the activity, but there was almost no substantial improvement at the
   later stage. In addition, the amount of feedback they obtained was
   positively related to the performance from the first round to the
   second round; however, few significant relationships were found from
   the second to the third round. This study also showed that the process
   of peer assessment could be used to clarify assessment criteria and
   that sufficient support from the instructor can maintain participants'
   attitudes towards this activity, which were relatively optimistic
   throughout.

TI e-Assessment and the student learning experience: A survey of student
   perceptions of e-assessment
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes a piece of research carried out at the University
   of Bradford into student perceptions of e-assessment. An online
   questionnaire was delivered to 130 undergraduates who had taken part in
   online assessment (either formative or summative) during the academic
   year 2007-2008. The survey looked at six main dimensions: (1) affective
   factors, (2) validity, (3) practical issues, (4) reliability, (5)
   security, and (6) learning and teaching. The aim of the survey was to
   identify possible risks in planning e-assessments, as well as to gauge
   student opinion. The findings of the survey indicated a range of
   opinions across the student body, with greatest concern about the
   fairness of item banking. It was also found that the most positive
   aspect of e-assessment in the eyes of students concerned the benefits
   that it can bring to teaching and learning. In addition, the paper
   concludes that age and gender did not significantly affect student
   responses in any of the areas studied.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
ID INFORMATION LITERACY; COMPUTER LITERACY
AB Attitude, experience and competence (broadly covered by the European
   Computer Driving Licence syllabus) in information technology (IT) were
   assessed in 846 1st-year Medical Sciences Division undergraduates
   (2003-06) at the start of their first term. Online assessments
   delivered during induction workshops were presented as an opportunity
   for self-evaluation and to provide performance-related recommendations
   for training. Results were consistent over 4 years. There was no
   difference in attitude between years or programme of study and the
   majority selected 'competent to use a range of applications'. Nor were
   there any differences in competence between all students in any year;
   however, male Medical Science students performed significantly better
   than females (2006). Students with a recognised IT qualification also
   did significantly better than those without. There was a discrepancy
   between measured skill and individual self-evaluation of competence; in
   particular, weaker students overestimated their competence. In all
   years, some students showed a fundamental lack of understanding of
   basic IT skills. Introducing online diagnostic testing raised the
   profile of the importance of IT skills to both academic staff and
   students.

TI The efficacy of final examinations: A comparative study of closed-book,
   invigilated exams and open-book, open-web exams
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSTRUCTIVISM
AB Educators have long debated the usefulness (or otherwise) of final
   examinations; a debate that has typically revolved around the relative
   merits of closed-book exams, open-book exams, take-home exams or their
   substitution by some other assessment format (eg, project work). This
   paper adds a new dimension to the debate by considering how the final
   examination assessment instrument might be enhanced through harnessing
   the power of technology, more specifically, how the learner experience
   of the final examination might be made more authentic and, in the
   process, more constructively aligned with stated learning outcomes. The
   authors report on the latest findings of an ongoing research project
   evaluating the effectiveness of 'open-book, open-web' (OBOW)
   examinations delivered by an online university, vis-a-vis a
   closed-book, invigilated alternative. Earlier research had indicated
   that the OBOW model receives the strong endorsement of students in a
   number of respects, most particularly the quality of the learning
   outcomes.

ID FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT; FEEDBACK
AB According to the Quality Assurance Agency, 'Assessment describes any
   processes that appraise an individual's knowledge, understanding,
   abilities or skills', and is inextricably linked to a course or
   programme's intended learning outcomes. It also has a fundamental
   effect on students' learning where it serves a variety of purposes
   including evaluation, feedback and motivation. Assessment also provides
   a performance indicator for both students and staff. E-assessment
   offers opportunities for creating innovative assessment practices that
   help engage students and increase their motivation for learning. The
   paper reports the findings of a qualitative study undertaken in the
   academic years 2006-07 and 2007-08 where a series of online summative
   assessments were introduced into a 1st-year financial accounting
   course. Feedback from students obtained from an evaluative survey and
   focus group interviews indicates that assessment played a significant
   role in the teaching/learning process. That is, students perceived a
   beneficial impact on learning, motivation and engagement.

TI Does regular online testing enhance student learning in the numerical
   sciences? Robust evidence from a large data set
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
ID PERFORMANCE; COURSES; WEB
AB While a number of studies have been conducted on the impact of online
   assessment and teaching methods on student learning, the field does not
   seem settled around the promised benefits of such approaches. It is
   argued that the reason for this state of affairs is that few studies
   have been able to control for a number of confounding factors in
   student performance. We report on the introduction of a regular (every
   3 weeks) low-mark online assessment tool in a large, first-year
   business mathematics course at the University of New South Wales, a
   major Australian university. Using a retrospective regression
   methodology together with a very large and rich data set, we test the
   proposition that exposure to the online assessment instrument enhances
   student learning. Significantly, we are able to control for prior
   student aptitude, in-course mastery, gender and even effort via a
   voluntary class attendance proxy. Furthermore, the study incorporates
   two large, and statistically diverse cohorts as well as manipulations
   in the model tested to robustly examine the outcomes. Our central
   result is that higher exposure to the online instrument robustly leads
   to higher student learning, all else being equal. Various implications
   for online assessment design, implementation and targeting are also
   discussed.

DT Article
ID SUBTRACTION; STUDENTS
AB This paper reports a study aimed at revealing special-educational-needs
   pupils' learning potential by means of an ICT-based assessment
   including a dynamic visual tool that might help pupils when solving
   mathematics problems. The study focused on subtraction problems up to
   100, which require 'borrowing'. These problems, in which the value of
   the ones-digit of the subtrahend is larger than the ones-digit of the
   minuend, are known as a serious difficulty for weak pupils in
   mathematics. Seven of such problems from a standardised test were
   placed in the ICT environment. Data were collected from two test
   conditions: the standardised written test format and the ICT version of
   the test items including the tool that provided pupils with a set of
   virtual manipulatives. The 37 pupils involved in the study were 8-12
   years old and from two special-education schools in the Netherlands.
   Comparison of the performance scores in the two formats showed that an
   ICT-based assessment format, including a dynamic visual tool, can
   reveal weak pupils' learning potential and strategy use. The study also
   pointed out that 'partial-tool use', ie, not carrying out the complete
   subtraction operation with the tool, can provide sufficient support to
   find the correct answer.

TI Catalytic assessment: understanding how MCQs and EVS can foster deep
   learning
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT
AB One technology for education whose adoption is currently expanding
   rapidly in UK higher education is that of electronic voting systems (
   EVS). As with all educational technology, whether learning benefits are
   achieved depends not on the technology but on whether an improved
   teaching method is introduced with it. EVS inherently relies on the
   multiple-choice question (MCQ) format, which many feel is associated
   with the lowest kind of learning of disconnected facts. This paper,
   however, discusses several ways in which teaching with MCQs, and so
   with EVS, has transcended this apparent disadvantage, has based itself
   on deep learning in the sense of focusing on learning relationships
   between items rather than on recalling disconnected true-false items,
   and so has achieved substantial learning advantages. Six possible
   learning designs based on MCQs are discussed, and a new function for
   (e-) assessment is identified, namely catalytic assessment, where the
   purpose of test questions is to trigger subsequent deep learning
   without direct teaching input.

TI Blended e-learning skeleton of conversation: Improving formative
   assessment in undergraduate dissertation supervision
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PERCEPTIONS
AB The supervision of undergraduate student dissertations is an area in
   need of research. Although some studies have already addressed this,
   these are primarily based on academic staff responses.
   This study contributes to knowledge by gathering the responses of
   students and focusing on formative electronic assessment. Data was
   collected using a student focus group and student questionnaire.
   Unsurprisingly, the findings suggest that good supervisor-student
   communication is crucial to the supervision process and a number of
   students felt unhappy with this aspect. However, to facilitate this
   communication, the perceived absolute necessity of regular
   supervisor-student meetings is being questioned and a combination of
   technology-enabled communication is advocated. It is suggested that to
   improve the undergraduate student dissertation experience, a
   combination of face-to-face and electronic formative assessment is
   used. In addition, the blended e-learning skeleton of conversation
   model provides a sound theoretical framework that could guide
   supervisors and students in the supervision process. This model is
   advocated for use in dissertation module design and in supervisor
   development.

TI What are learners actually regulating when given feedback?
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PERFORMANCE; MOTIVATION
AB e-Assessment cannot benefit learners, and so education, unless it
   supports them in doing something differently in future. What, however,
   are learners trying to do better? This paper adopts a perspective in
   which learners simultaneously self-regulate multiple variables that are
   relevant to learning, and develops a theoretical argument that a key
   issue is the ambiguity of feedback events (such as a failed task or a
   poor mark) as to which variable should be adjusted. A common tacit
   assumption is that the relevant loop is about technical expertise, but
   in reality, students must and do also adjust effort, learning methods
   and course choices. Two methods for helping learners by resolving this
   ambiguity are discussed: telling learners directly which interpretation
   is relevant, and structuring learning activities to focus on one
   variable. Which loops are most important to learners generally shifts
   in the transition from school to university, implying that the role of
   feedback also changes. e-Assessment needs a major rethink to address
   these needs, and to understand why feedback is so often apparently
   ignored by students. Conversely, attending to all these loops would be
   to open new dialogues with learners.

TI Intended and unintended consequences of student use of an online
   questioning environment
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB While supplementation of face-to-face (F2F) teaching with online
   engagement is increasingly common, the educators' challenge of teaching
   F2F personalities and facilitating online personalities has not been
   widely explored. In this paper, we report on a project in which
   1st-year students attended F2F sessions and engaged with an anonymous
   online questioning environment. The differences between students' F2F
   and online behaviour led to intended and unintended consequences. The
   purpose of this paper is to explore these intended and unintended
   consequences of technology use. The project was undertaken over a
   3-year period, starting in 2004. In 2004, a pilot project was conducted
   based on a class of 35 students studying a 1st-year programming course
   in information systems. The investigation was again conducted in 2005
   for the same course, this time with 63 students. In 2006, the project
   was extended to a class of 610 1st-year commerce students studying an
   introductory information systems course. In all cases, students met F2F
   and when online, engaged with an anonymous Web/SMS collaborative tool.
   The intended consequence was that a blending of F2F with online
   interaction extended student engagement beyond the limitation of a
   classroom and provided a forum for further collaboration and
   consultation. The intended outcome was achieved. An unintended
   consequence was that the tool provided the lecturer with diagnostic
   information that was used to impact on pedagogical designs. This was
   often a result of students taking on an online personality that would
   very often be extremely frank and honest about the manner in which the
   course was conducted, and how learning was taking place. The findings
   show that students used the tool in ways that exceeded the envisaged
   intention, and student use of the tool positively impacted on the
   curriculum, pedagogy and general running of the course. The paper
   concludes that integration of online engagement with F2F teaching adds
   value to the teaching and learning experience.

AB Peer moderation of group work in higher education is rapidly advancing
   through the use of technological developments and is increasingly being
   informed by pedagogical research. The highly successful WebPA online
   assessment system has gone through a number of development phases over
   its 15-year history and has now evolved into a relatively mature and
   flexible tool for facilitating group work. This paper presents a case
   study of the approaches that have been used in the system's development
   from the technical perspective, and describes how the scope of the
   project has massively expanded and that the development has been
   continually backed by a sound and wide-ranging pedagogy. The benefits
   of using the online system are shown to be underpinned throughout by
   examples of good practice in the supervision of academic group work. A
   critical evaluation of the tool and surrounding pedagogical practices
   highlight future areas for technical expansion.

TI Mutual feedback in e-portfolio assessment: an approach to the netfolio
   system
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PEER
AB This paper presents an alternative application of e-portfolio in a
   university student assessment context. A concept based on student
   collaboration (called netfolio) is developed, that differs from the
   classical e-portfolio concept. The use of a netfolio, a network of
   student e-portfolios, in a virtual classroom is explained through an
   exploratory study. A netfolio is more than a group of e-portfolios
   because it offers students a better understanding of learning
   objectives and promotes self-revision through participation in
   assessment of other students' learning, as indicated through their
   portfolios. Class student e-portfolios are interconnected in a unique
   netfolio such that each student assesses their peers' work and at the
   same time is being assessed. This process creates a chain of
   co-evaluators, facilitating a mutual and progressive improvement
   process. Results about teachers' and students' mutual feedback are
   presented and the benefits of the process in terms of academic
   achievements are analysed.

AB This research explored the influence of a Web-based portfolio
   assessment system on students' performances. The methodological
   procedure adopted was to have the experimental group use the system,
   with the control group using conventional assessment. The study
   subjects were junior high school students of two computer classes. The
   experimental results revealed that the use of the system has
   significant positive influence on students' performances. According to
   estimated effect size, the most significant indicators were reflection,
   self-assessment, continuous improvement, goal setting, problem solving,
   data gathering, work and peer interaction. However, peer-assessment
   performance was not enhanced significantly. Therefore, one
   recommendation was to reduce peer-assessment and instead offer specific
   illustrations to the students as well as the opportunity to drill.

TI e-Assessment for learning? The potential of short-answer free-text
   questions with tailored feedback
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A natural language based system has been used to author and mark
   short-answer free-text assessment tasks. Students attempt the questions
   online and are given tailored and relatively detailed feedback on
   incorrect and incomplete responses, and have the opportunity to repeat
   the task immediately so as to learn from the feedback provided. The
   answer matching has been developed in the light of student responses to
   the questions. A small number of the questions are now in low-stakes
   summative use, alongside other e-assessment tasks and tutor-marked
   assignments, to give students instantaneous feedback on constructed
   response items, to help them to monitor their progress and to encourage
   dialogue with their tutor. The answer matching has been demonstrated to
   be of similar or greater accuracy than specialist human markers.
   Students have been observed attempting the questions and have been seen
   to respond in differing ways to both the questions themselves and the
   feedback provided. We discuss features of appropriate items for
   assessment of this type.

TI e is for exploration: Assessing hard-to-measure learning outcomes
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The focus of this paper is on the use of e-technologies to enable
   higher education to better assess aspects of learning that have proved
   difficult to assess using more conventional means. Higher education
   describes the knowledge and abilities it intends its graduates to have
   acquired before graduation, and it has a wide range of approaches to
   assess these. Higher education also seeks affective outcomes in the
   form of values, attitudes, behaviours and related attributes or
   dispositions, and these have consistently proved more difficult to
   assess by examination or assignment. After graduation, however,
   graduates are often assessed within the professions via portfolios,
   interview and peer or expert review. Assessment may focus on teamwork
   and networking skills, productivity, creativity and values fit to the
   profession. How can e-technologies help with these forms of assessment?
   This paper reviews some of the e-based approaches and explorations that
   have supported or could support assessment of affective attributes. At
   each stage, the paper seeks to establish the common elements of
   assessment in the different regimes and how e-assessment contributes,
   or may contribute in the future. The paper concludes that many of the
   strengths of e-assessment lend themselves to an evaluation paradigm
   rather than to conventional assessment for intended learning outcomes.

AB This Study examined how 770 nonscience majors, enrolled ill a
   core-curriculum science course, conceptualized their motivation to
   learn science. The students responded to the Science Motivation
   Questionnaire, a 30-item Likert type instrument designed to provide
   science education researchers and science instructors with information
   about students' motivation to learn science. The students' scores on
   the Science Motivation Questionnaire were reliable and related to
   students' high school preparation in science, GPA in college science
   courses, and belief in the relevance of science to their careers. An
   exploratory factor analysis provided evidence of construct validity,
   revealing that the students conceptualized their motivation to learn
   science ill terms of five dimensions: intrinsic motivation and personal
   relevance, self-efficacy and assessment anxiety, self-determination
   career motivation. and grade motivation. Women and men had different
   profiles oil these dimensions, but equivalent overall motivation to
   learn science. Essays by all of like students explaining their
   motivation to team science and interviews with a sample of the students
   were used to interpret Science Motivation Questionnaire scores. The
   findings were viewed in terms of a social-cognitive theory of learning,
   and directions for future research were discussed. (C) 2008 Wiley

AB "Situational interest" is a short-term form of motivation which occurs
   when a specific situation stimulates the Focused attention of students
   (e.g., a spectacular science demonstration could arouse transient
   interest amongst nearly all the Students in a class, even those who are
   not normally interested in science). However, there have been very few
   studies of situational interest and its potential to motivate students
   in science classrooms. The purpose of this project was to investigate
   situational interest and its sources. Small groups of grade 9 students
   participated in a science lesson which focused oil inquiry skills, and
   data were obtained on their interest levels and sources of interest.
   The results indicated that interest arousal was substantial but did
   fluctuate throughout the lesson, according to the types of activities
   in which students were involved. The main source of interest was
   novelty, although choice, physical activity, and social involvement
   were also implicated. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach

AB The National Science Education Standards [National Research Council
   (1996) National science education standards. Washington, DC: National
   Academy Press] recommend that students understand the apparent patterns
   of motion of the sun, moon and stars by the end of early elementary
   school. However, little information exists oil students' ability to
   learn these concepts. This study examines the change in students'
   understanding of apparent celestial motion after attending a
   planetarium program using kinesthetic learning techniques. Pre- and
   post-interviews were conducted with participants from seven classes of
   first and second grade students (N = 63). Students showed significant
   improvement in knowledge of all areas of apparent celestial motion
   covered by the planetarium program. This suggests that students in
   early elementary school are capable of learning the accurate
   description of apparent celestial motion. The results also demonstrate
   the value of both kinesthetic learning techniques, and the rich visual
   environment of the planetarium for improved understanding of celestial
   motion. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 46: 192209,2009

AB This study had the goal of exploring factors associated with elementary
   students' (N = 585) reports of intellectual risk taking in science.
   Intellectual risk taking (IRT) was defined as engaging in adaptive
   learning behaviors (sharing tentative ideas, asking questions,
   attempting to do and learn new things) that placed the learner at risk
   of making mistakes or appearing less competent than others. Results of
   hierarchical regression indicate that students' reports of IRT declined
   by grade-level, but were positively related to interest in science,
   creative self-efficacy, and perceptions of teacher support. Of all the
   factors considered, interest in science was found to have the strongest
   unique and positive relationship with students' reports of intellectual
   risk taking in science. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci

AB Prospective teachers enrolling for teacher education programmes often
   bring with them fixed images and beliefs about the roles they see
   themselves fulfilling ill the teaching profession. The aim of this
   research was to uncover, firstly, beginning student teachers' initial
   perceptions of the roles that they see themselves performing, and
   secondly, to understand how, after authentic school-based experiences,
   the student teachers have subsequently (re)arranged their perceptions
   of teacher roles. Interviews were conducted based on visual collages
   that the student teachers constructed and analysed by means of
   metaphorical lenses. We found that the teacher education programme with
   its strong focus on the teacher-as-self had indeed challenged some of
   the traditional roles that student teachers saw themselves fulfilling.
   One such significant change was revealed by their assertions that they
   cannot be sole knowledge providers but must rather be facilitators of
   learning, challenging students through the design of powerful learning
   environments to use the multiple information sources of the knowledge
   age. Another overwhelming role perception was that of Mother (caring
   and nurturing) elicited by the HIV/Aids pandemic, which would leave
   many learners orphaned in the Southern African context.

AB First-year student dropout in the university sector can reach 20% or
   higher. Over a two-year period, a simple instrument was developed to
   identify potential student low performance and withdrawal. It was based
   on a measure of students' early expectation of higher education,
   matched subsequently with their actual experience. The instrument
   design was based both on the concept of a psychological contract, taken
   from the Field of employment relations, and Seven Principles of good
   undergraduate teaching. An intervention programme of interviews was
   instituted with low-scoring students. Findings, both statistical and
   qualitative, indicated a potentially useful role for the instrument,
   and,in improvement in Student progression and achievement for those
   receiving remedial intervention.

AB Professionally oriented tertiary-level courses such as allied health
   courses in Australia are under pressure from both their professions and
   the federal government to provide educational outcomes that prepare
   graduates for the workplace, This has resulted in a number of allied
   Courses adopting problem-based learning (PBL), a teaching approach in
   which students can gain knowledge through solving real-life work-based
   problems. Problems with the approach, however, have been reported in
   the tertiary classroom setting including students inadequately
   preparing for class work, not working effectively in groups, and not
   discussing problems to an appropriate depth, In addition, both students
   and staff have expressed concerns about its time-consuming nature. This
   paper reports oil a range of strategies trialled in a tertiary
   classroom setting to overcome many of these commonly reported problems.
   The trial found that the combination of strategies used resulted in
   high rates of student preparation and participation in group
   discussion. It also found that these strategies resulted in students
   investing time that was within university guidelines and expectations
   thus providing a set of useful solutions for PBL practitioners and
   their students.

AB The central argument or this paper is that adopting some of the
   techniques practised by stand-up comedians can help teachers in higher
   education challenge students ill ways that will ultimately improve the
   student teaming experience overall. It Will Suggest that developing
   co-dependent relationships and over-engaging with students is disabling
   rather than enabling. Instead it will suggest that it is helpful to use
   'strategies of omission' that result in challenge to students and
   promote disjunction ill their lives which in turn promotes the
   development of criticality. However, we need to stress from the Outset
   that the paper has nothing at all to do with comedy. This paper is
   offered as practitioner investigation, making use of the practitioners'
   stories of their experience as data.

AB The examination of doctoral theses controls an important academic
   threshold, yet practices are often private, codes non-specific, and
   individuals isolated. This article adds to recent investigation of the
   examination Culture by reporting informal panel discussion amongst a
   total of 23 University of Auckland (New Zealand) faculty members as to
   their experiences of examining the written doctoral thesis and of being
   the oral examiner. Some of the examiners' comments concur, and some
   differ, with the gap between subjective opinions as valuable as the
   points of concurrence in profiling covert criteria and closed-door
   decision-making practices. Doctoral examiners, higher education
   professionals, supervisors and doctoral candidates will find these
   perspectives useful towards considering their own role in this ritual.

AB The study described in this paper has examined whether concept mapping
   can be used to help students to improve their learning achievement and
   interests. The participants were 124 Students from two classes enrolled
   in ail advanced accounting Course at the School of Management of a
   university in Taiwan. The experimental data revealed two important
   results. First, adopting a concept mapping strategy can significantly
   improve Students' learning achievement compared to using a traditional
   expository teaching method. Second, most of the students were satisfied
   with using concept mapping in an advanced accounting course. They
   indicated that concept mapping call help them to understand, integrate
   and clarify accounting concepts and also enhance their interests in
   learning accounting. They also thought that concept mapping could be
   usefully used in other curriculum areas.

AB Educational research and development into c-learning mainly focuses on
   the inclusion of new technological features without taking into account
   psycho-pedagogical concerns that are likely to improve a learner's
   cognitive process in this new educational category, This paper presents
   an instructional model that combines objectivist and constructivist
   learning theories, The model is based on the concept of a learning
   objective which is composed of a set of learning objects. A software
   tool, called the Instruction Aid System (IAS), has been developed to
   guide instructors through the development of learning objectives and
   the execution of the analysis and design phases of the proposed
   instructional model. Additionally, a blended approach to the learning
   process in Web-based distance education is also presented. This
   approach combines various event-based activities: self-paced learning,
   live c-learning and the use of face-to-face contact in classrooms.

   discussed within the corporate social responsibility literature. It
   also includes examples or some of the methods and tools used at
   universities across the world. This overview helps to set the context
   for and identify the relevance of civil involvement projects in this
   area. Following the literature review, we outline an approach to civic
   involvement projects that has been developed at Sabanci University in
   Turkey. The paper concludes with some suggestions for universities that
   are developing or planning to develop their own social responsibility

AB Effective integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
   into teaching and learning is becoming an essential competency for
   teachers. However, teachers do not usually follow linear instructional
   design models when they are planning for ICT integration. This paper
   proposes a generic model, which consists of three fundamental elements:
   pedagogy, social interaction and technology. Sound design of these
   components should help teachers to integrate ICT into their curricula
   in effective ways. Constructivist learning theories, the design of
   interactivity and the notion of usefulness provide the theoretical
   foundations for the construction of this model. Some examples of
   applying this model to the design of Web-based learning environments,
   facilitation of online discussions and comparison of ICT tools are
   presented.

AB The paper deals with the use of visual stereotypes in virtual
   pedagogical agents and its potential impact in digital learning
   environments. An analysis of the concept of visual stereotypes is
   followed by a discussion of affordances and drawbacks as to their use
   in the context of traditional media. Next, the paper explores whether
   virtual pedagogical characters introduce anything novel with regard to
   the use of visual stereotypes - as compared both to real life
   interaction between humans and to the use of visual stereotypes in
   traditional non-interactive media such as magazines, film, television
   and video. It is proposed that novel affordances, as well as novel
   drawbacks, indeed are being introduced with the use of visual
   stereotypes in virtual characters. The conclusion of the paper is that
   knowledge on these matters can be useful both for developers of
   educational systems and for educators in enabling them to strengthen
   some pedagogical settings and activities.

AB The authors report on a project in which a new experiential form of
   professional learning combined ethical thinking processes with a
   collaborative meeting technology known as the Zing team learning system
   (ZTLS). A new software program called Working Wisely was built by the
   completion of the project. The ZTLS in combination with Working Wisely
   facilitates communities of practice (Fleer, Edwards, Hammer, Kennedy,
   Ridgway, Robbins, & Surman, 2006; Wenger, 1998) focused on ethical
   issues. The participants in the pilot project included 10 staff members
   of an early childhood education facility (long day care centre) who met
   for a series of professional development sessions in a learning
   community that combined industry, university, and commercial
   stakeholders. By the end of the project, participants were able to move
   their knowledge from individual tacit knowledge to shared articulated
   knowledge with an ethical focus. This paper focuses on the facilities
   that were embedded in the software to develop thinking and discourse
   processes. The authors faced challenges in translating paper-based
   thinking processes with numerous steps into simple methods that could
   be undertaken on an information communication technology (ICT) platform
   using the ZTLS. These were resolved by the development of miniature and
   iterative dialectical thinking processes within thinking steps that
   facilitated discourse. The use of dialectical and ethical discourse in
   this community of practice led to positive outcomes and has
   considerable potential in many other areas of academic endeavour. We
   have called our new type of interaction Ethical Dialectical Discourse.

DE Educational technology; Design-based research; Values; Methodology;
   Critique
AB The role of educational technologies in improving educational practices
   and outcomes has been criticized as over-hyped and insignificant. With
   few exceptions, the state of education has changed less than expected
   as a result of tools such as computers and the Internet. To a
   considerable degree, this is due to the minor role educational
   technology research plays in transforming the use of technological
   tools in the classroom. This article presents an analysis of technology
   as a process and as a value-laden system, both of which have
   substantial consequences to our approach to research. It is argued in
   the article that design-based research can address some of the
   deficiencies of other research methods in investigating the role of
   tools and techniques in the classroom. Through more democratic research
   practices and recognizing technology as a system beyond its tools,
   researchers can increase their impact on educational practice.

TI Randomised Items in Computer-based Tests: Russian Roulette in
   Assessment?
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE Computer-based tests; Fairness; Cheating; Randomisation of items;
   Anxiety
ID TEST ANXIETY; PERFORMANCE; PERSONALITY; STUDENTS; MEMORY
AB Computer-based assessments are becoming more commonplace, perhaps as a
   necessity for faculty to cope with large class sizes. These tests often
   occur in large computer testing venues in which test security may be
   compromised. In an attempt to limit the likelihood of cheating in such
   venues, randomised presentation of items is automatically programmed
   into testing software, such that neighbouring screens present different
   items to the test-taker. This article argues that randomisation of test
   items can be a disadvantage to students who were randomly presented
   with difficult items first. Such disadvantage would violate the
   American Psychological Association's published guidelines concerning
   testing and assessment that call for the principle of fairness for
   test-takers across diverse test modes. Owing to the smallness of the
   chance of a student being randomly assigned difficult items first, it
   may be hard to prove such disadvantage. However, even if only one
   test-taker is affected once during a high-stakes test, the principle of
   fairness is compromised. This article reports on four instances out of
   about 400 in which students may either have been unfairly advantaged or
   disadvantaged by being given a series of easy or difficult items at the
   beginning of the test. Although the results are not statistically
   significant, we conclude that more research needs to be done before one
   can ignore what we have named the Item Randomisation Effect.

AB The purpose of the study is to investigate some of the factors that
   contribute to satisfaction of participants in an online Information
   Technologies Certificate Program (ITCP). The program includes eight
   courses and lasts four semesters. The sample consisted of 30
   participants who enrolled to the program and 8 instructors who gave the
   courses in this program in 2004-2005. The data was collected through
   both qualitative and quantitative methods. An online questionnaire was
   used to gather data on participants' satisfaction about the program,
   semi-structured interviews were conducted with both the participants
   and the instructors to analyze the factors that contribute to
   satisfaction in the program, and asynchronous and synchronous
   communication transcripts were examined to support the findings.
   Descriptive statistics were reported upon the participants'
   satisfaction in regard to learner-learner interaction,
   learner-instructor interaction, course structure, institutional
   support, and flexibility. A repeated measure analysis test was utilized
   to see the changes in the participants' satisfaction throughout this
   online program based on semester one, two, three, and four. The results
   of the study showed that even though the participants' overall
   satisfaction was generally positive, it decreased significantly toward
   the final semesters of the program. The findings highlighted some of
   the critical issues such as "learning community formation through
   interaction, well structured and guided project or problem-based group
   activities, considering instructional design and cognitive principles
   in the design of the program, and flexibility in time and selection of
   the courses" that should be taken into account in designing online
   programs.

AB Computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) has captured many
   educators and researchers to contribute their efforts on this domain.
   This study proposed a two-dimension concept to explain learners'
   collaboration behaviors in a CSCL laboratory setting. A two-dimension
   process, namely perceptual dimensions and supportive dimensions, is
   useful to explain why learners' are willing to collaborate online. One
   hundred undergraduate students were divided into 20 work groups, each
   group consisting of 5 members. The result showed different group
   composition of extraverts will influence learners' perceptual dimension
   of group context variables, which in turn will be associated with
   supportive dimension of CSCL process. We conclude that educators and
   CSCL developers should focus not only on the technical factors of
   system development, but also on learners' psychological factors because
   of its impacts on the latter process-supportive dimension which
   especially stands for learners' collective behaviors of collaboration.

AB Instructional elements remain the foundation of current instructional
   design practice. Practice is the instructional element provided after
   learners have been given information required to master an objective
   and Navigation is the non-instructional element guides the learner on
   the sequence of instruction. Linear Navigation can be referred to as
   program control where the learners do not have control over sequence
   and Non-Linear Navigation can be referred to as Learner control over
   sequence of instruction. The purpose of this study was to investigate
   the effect of practice with feedback, navigation type on achievement,
   attitude, and time when students use a web-based instructional program
   and the interaction between practice and navigation type. 240 students
   from a large south western university participated in four different
   web based environments. Significant differences were found for practice
   main effect, but not for navigation main effect. There was no
   interaction between practice and navigation. There were significant
   differences for attitude items, I learned a lot from this program and
   the program gave me enough opportunity to practice between the
   treatments who received practice and those who did not. This study
   reinforces on the importance of practice and has implications for the
   design and development of web-based, multimedia instruction.

AB The WWW is now in widespread use for delivering on-line learning
   content in many large-scale education settings. Given such widespread
   usage, it is feasible to accumulate data concerning the most useful
   learning experiences of past students and share them with future
   students. Browsing events that depict how past students utilized the
   learning content to accomplish higher levels of achievement are
   especially valuable. This paper presents a new method for identifying
   potentially effective browsing events based on a contextualized
   browsing model built through association mining and statistical
   techniques. The model annotates browsing events with several contextual
   factors, including educational ones (group relevance and performance
   relevance) and non-educational ones (support and confidence). Based on
   this model, a personalized content recommender was implemented in a
   Web-based learning content management system, called IDEAL, to deliver
   personalized learning content based on a student's browsing history. An
   experiment was conducted to compare the user feedback concerning the
   recommendations provided through different recommendation models. The
   results show that students with different levels of achievement prefer
   different types of contextualization information. Finally, another
   performance experiment demonstrated that the contextualized browsing
   model is more effective in improving learning performance than the pure
   association mining model.

AB Business intelligence and information logistics have become an
   important part of teaching curricula in recent years due to the
   increased demand for adequately trained graduates. Since these fields
   are characterized by a high amount of software and methodology
   innovations, teaching materials and teaching aids require constant
   updating. Teradata has teamed up with lecturers and researchers to
   build and run a portal to support teaching business intelligence and
   information logistics. This article describes how faculty can use the
   Teradata University Network (TUN) to prepare and run courses by reusing
   teaching materials and running state-of-the-art commercial software
   provided in an application service provider model. It furthermore
   describes experiences with an actual course on management information
   systems taught by the authors. Students' feedback on the course design
   is presented and conclusions are drawn on two similar courses. Our
   action research results show that students' adoption of and feedback
   about such courses has been very encouraging.

AB This paper investigates the uses of various kinds of hypermedia format
   for history learning, which specifically emphasizes on the role of
   causal reasoning about history accounts. Three different groups in the
   last school year of Secondary Education (aged 16) studied the same
   materials about the Discovery of America in three different formats:
   (a) linear text in paper, (b) conventional hypertext with a content
   structure in network, and (c) hypergraphic with an explicitly causal
   structure and guiding questions inserted in the causal connections. The
   results in this last group were better in almost every causal reasoning
   task, but no statistically significant differences were obtained. The
   design of graphic information and specific interrogations for causal
   reasoning in a hypergraphic format could exert some positive effects.
   However, this type of resources is not enough to succeed in implying
   students with little previous knowledge in self-explanation and review
   processes of their causal models about history accounts.

AB Recently, a lot of open source e-learning platforms have been offered
   for free in the Internet. We thus incorporate the intelligent diagnosis
   and assessment tool into an open software e-learning platform developed
   for programming language courses, wherein the proposed learning
   diagnosis assessment tools based on text mining and machine learning
   techniques are employed to alleviate the loading of the teachers.
   Experiments were conducted in two introductory-undergraduate
   programming courses to examine the effectiveness of the proposed
   diagnosis and assessment tools. The learners' work including the source
   code and comments were processed by the proposed text mining and
   machine learning techniques. This system also provides immediate
   feedback and high-quality evaluation results to guide the learners with
   poor performance. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed
   work can effectively assist the low-ability learners.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of
   response modes by item and feedback type in a web-based language
   learning program. The subjects of this study, 122 Korean tenth graders
   learning English as a foreign language, were placed into groups of four
   and were given a web-based language learning program consisting of two
   different varieties of item type (multiple choice and constructed
   response) and two forms of feedback (explicit and implicit). The
   results of this study suggest that the constructed response mode has a
   greater effect than the multiple-choice mode on the recall and the
   transfer of the students' learning. Second, the explicit response mode
   has a greater effect than the implicit response mode on the recall and
   the transfer of the students' learning. Third, there is an
   interactional effect between the item response mode and the feedback
   response mode in web-based language learning.

AB The major purpose of this study is to assist college students in
   constructing mental representation of referential resolution in a
   computer system. Ninety students were asked to draw mental maps
   indicating the relationships between references, take reading
   comprehension tests, and fill out open-ended questionnaire. Results
   showed that the correlation between referential resolution and reading
   comprehension ranged from 61% to 75% in three reading tasks. The more
   students practiced in referential resolution, the higher average score
   they obtained in the reading comprehension test. Students also
   requested fewer feedbacks when they progressed to better comprehend the
   final online text. That is, they became more independent and relied
   less on the system's feedback in their reading development. Although
   seventy-six students expressed that they learned from building
   connections of related words and made progressed in reading
   comprehension, fourteen students revealed that they still had
   difficulties after using the online system. This deserved more
   investigation in the future.

   Welfare valuation
AB Physicians have acknowledged information technology (IT) efficiency and
   now utilize it in their professional practice and patient management.
   The benefits of IT within the health care environment has received
   academic attention, however existing literature currently pertains to
   limited areas, including the financial effects of telemedicine
   networks, and both the acceptability of this branch of medical care and
   the perceptions of patients and clinicians. Studies on welfare
   valuation of telecommunication health services in an economy are
   deficient. Based on a welfare concept valuation method, this research
   provides systematic as well as empirical analysis of telemedicine and
   finds that online CME plays a key role in enhancing the health care
   environment. The quantity of health services, the quality of the health
   care environment, as well as a consumer surplus all increased with
   online CME lectures. Such lectures are underprovided in telemedicine
   systems. Appropriate government intervention or programs, through
   adding physicians for local on-site visits with the electronic health
   care program and increasing the availability and quality of online CME,
   could possibly remedy the situation and establish a stable,
   well-structured, and effective medical care system for rural areas.

AB The paper presents a case study of the educational exploitation of
   group blogging for the implementation of a "learning by design"
   activity. More specifically, a group of students used a blog as a
   communication and information management tool in the University course
   of ICT-enhanced Geometry learning activities. The analysis of the
   designed learning activities, the blog content and log files, as well
   as the points of view of the students (via a questionnaire and a group
   interview) expressed upon completion of the activity gives significant
   findings supporting the researchers' initial hypotheses about the
   potential of blogs' educational applications. Blogs combined with a
   proper pedagogical approach such as 'learning by design' enable
   teachers to offer high quality learning experiences to their students.

AB The purpose of this qualitative case study was to analyze enabling
   factors in the technology integration change process in a multi-section
   science methods course, SCIED 408 (pseudonym), from 1997 to 2003 at a
   large northeastern university in the United States. We used two major
   data collection methods, in-depth interviewing and document reviews. We
   interviewed seven participants who played the role of change agents
   twice during the six-year period of time and examined documents related
   to integrating science specific technology in this multi-section
   course. The formation of a sustained, shared leadership team, the
   formation of a learning community, and the positive influences from
   educational systems emerged as three enabling factors to facilitate and
   sustain the technology integration change process. The interaction of
   the three factors also appeared to encourage greater capacity to deal
   with change.

TI Teachers' Perceptions of the Dimensions and Implementation of
   Technology Leadership of Principals in Taiwanese Elementary Schools
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE Elementary schools; Principal technology leadership; Technology
   integration; Technology literacy; Technology vision
AB Principals' technology leadership is strongly correlated with teachers'
   integration of educational technology, and technology leadership is
   necessary for effective utilization of technology in schooling. The
   article describes a study that empirically investigated teachers'
   perceptions of elementary schools principals' technology leadership
   practice in seven cities in Taiwan for understanding the implementation
   of technology leadership. This study used structural equation modeling
   with prospective data to test for model fit. The findings identified
   the four constructs (i.e., vision, staff development, infrastructure
   support, evaluation and research) comprising principals' technology
   leadership. The findings also show that interpersonal and communication
   skills are important antecedents to principals' overall effective
   technology leadership. Four themes (e.g., budget shortage, technology
   facilities, staff development, and leadership problems) which emerged
   from the transcript data were the practical problems that principals
   faced while they implemented technology leadership in their schools.
   The results suggest that principals who embrace technology will
   effectively lead their schools to acquire educational resources to
   enhance student engagement and learning.

TI The Impact of Externalizing Readers' Mental Representation on the
   Comprehension of Online Texts
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE Mental representation; Referential resolution; Reading failure; Process
   data; Main idea
AB This study reports on our design of a computer system which supports
   the understanding of how students construct their mental representation
   of references and how the construction failures impede their reading
   comprehension. Three modules, User interface, Recording, and Feedback
   were implemented. The recording module traced all students' reading
   process when they tried to link sentences together by references.
   Results showed that more-proficient readers' mental process in
   resolving references was constructed to be a complete and coherent
   network. When they encountered reading difficulty, they usually engaged
   in comprehension monitoring to read and reread the related sentences to
   find out contextual clues. They also asked for a feedback tool for
   assistance. All these helped them grasp the main idea of a text and
   solve lexical ambiguities. In contrast, average and less-proficient
   readers often resolved the references separately or mismatched them to
   an incorrect subject which led to partial understanding of textual
   information. Their unsuccessful resolution of references in previous
   sentences often hindered their interpretation of subsequent sentences.
   This caused repeated reading failures in the comprehension of an online
   text. The mental maps and reading process shown in this study clearly
   explain students' reading success and failure. The discussion of these
   maps and processes between the teacher and students will be one of the
   ways to promote latter's awareness in employing comprehension
   monitoring and referring strategy.

AB As computers becomes more ubiquitous in our everyday lives, educational
   settings are being transformed where educators and students are
   expected to teach and learn, using computers (Lee, 2003). This study,
   therefore, explored pre-service teachers' self reported future
   intentions to use computers in Singapore and Malaysia. A survey
   methodology was employed such that validated items from past relevant
   research work were adopted. Based on the Technology Acceptance Model
   (TAM), 495 completed surveys of pre-service teachers were collected
   from both countries. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was implemented
   on the data captured. This study contributes to the growing
   multi-cultural studies on TAM by demonstrating that perceived
   usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU) and computer attitudes
   (CA) to be significant determinants of both Singaporean and Malaysian
   pre-service teachers' behavioral intention (BI). Differences were,
   however, detected between Singaporean and Malaysian pre-service
   teachers in terms of PU, PEU and CA but no differences were detected in
   BI with regards to technology acceptance.

AB The purpose of this qualitative research study is to gauge the current
   state of the academic developments in Educational Technology in order
   to identify pivotal issues and offer suggestions for future planning in
   Canada. This article explores the professional literature and the views
   of 25 senior faculty members from the twelve Canadian universities
   which offer or offered graduate degree programs in Educational
   Technology (and Distance Education). Findings from the study revealed
   one main category (challenges) connected to the academic field of
   Educational Technology in Canada with seven key sub-categories, namely,
   identity, standardization and professionalization, university politics,
   external influence, competition, funding, and teaching and learning. A
   synthesis of information sources is provided to delineate major
   patterns and generate new theory to help guide strategic program
   planning and evaluation. Recommendations suggest that greater attention
   should be invested in partnering and identity branding activities
   within the field to help leverage program success.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate current parental support for
   student learning with information technology (IT) in Hong Kong. A total
   of 3340 and 3656 parents and 539 and 440 primary school heads responded
   to two surveys in 2005/06 and 2006/07, respectively, in this
   cross-sectional study. The results show a persistent positive
   perception of and support for IT among educators and parents, which
   signify a solid foundation for the extension of student learning from
   the classroom to the home environment. The high level of expectation
   among school heads for parental support reflects the need for schools
   to initiate cooperation with parents to extend IT-supported learning to
   the home setting. The shift in parental apprehension from worry over
   the provision of IT facilities to worry over the cultivation of proper
   attitudes toward the use of IT reveals the importance of fostering
   information literacy in home-school collaboration. (C) 2008 Elsevier

AB Reflection plays a very important role in learning processes and is
   very helpful for promoting learning performance. Many higher education
   institutions today are actively promoting learners' reflection ability
   in order to help them cope with the fast changing world they will be
   entering when they graduate. Online learning provides potential for
   applying new teaching and learning strategies. However, it has not yet
   been systematically studied how to concretely apply reflection
   strategies in an online learning environment. The aim of this study is
   to explore how high level prompts and peer assessment can affect a
   learner's reflection levels in an online learning context. The
   participants were 157 university students and each individual was
   randomly assigned to one of the fourteen learning conditions. We found
   that the main factor affecting reflection levels is high level prompts
   followed by high quality observation that has a moderating effect on
   learners' reflection levels. However, peer feedback has no significant
   influence on reflection levels. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Objective: Since simulations are often accepted uncritically, with
   excessive emphasis being placed on technological sophistication at the
   expense of underlying psychological and educational theories, we
   evaluated the learning performance of simulation software, in order to
   gain insight into the proper use of simulations for application in
   medical education.
   Design: The authors designed and evaluated a software packet, following
   of user-centered development, which they call Haemodynamics Simulator
   (HAEMOSIM), for the simulation of complex physiological models, e.g..
   the modeling of arterial blood flow dependent on the pressure gradient,
   radius and bifurcations; shear-stress and blood flow profiles depending
   on viscosity and radius.
   Measurements: In a quasi-experimental real-life setup, the authors
   compared the learning performance of 96 medical students for three
   conditions: (1) conventional text-based lesson; (2) HAEMOSIM alone and
   (3) HAEMOSIM with a combination of additional material and support,
   found necessary during user-centered development. The individual
   student's learning time was unvarying in all three conditions. Results:
   While the first two settings produced equivalent results, the
   combination of additional support and HAEMOSIM yielded a significantly
   higher learning performance. These results are discussed regarding
   Mayer's multimedia learning theory, Sweller's cognitive load theory,
   and claims of prior research on utilizing interactive simulations for
   learning.
   Conclusion: The results showed that simulations can be beneficial for
   learning complex concepts, however, interacting with sophisticated
   simulations strain the limitation of cognitive processes; therefore
   successful application of simulations require careful additional
   guidance from medical professionals and a certain amount of previous
   knowledge on the part of the learners. The inclusion of pedagogical and
   psychological expertise into the design and development of educational
   software is essential. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of the study is to build a model that predicts the level of
   technology acceptance by pre-service teachers at a teacher training
   institute in Singapore. It examines relationships among variables
   associated with factors that influence technology acceptance. Data was
   collected from 475 participants using a survey questionnaire. Employing
   structural equation modelling, a hypothesized model was tested for
   model fit in the study. The resulting model is found to have a good
   fit. Perceived usefulness, attitude towards computer use, and computer
   self-efficacy have direct effect on pre-service teachers' technology
   acceptance, whereas perceived ease of use, technological complexity,
   and facilitating conditions affect technology acceptance indirectly.
   These six variables account for approximately 27.1% of the variance of
   behavioural intention. Perceived usefulness appeared to the strongest
   determinant of behavioural intention. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The current practice of traditional in-class lecture for learning
   computer science (CS) in the high schools of Taiwan is in need of
   revamping. Teachers instruct on the use of commercial software instead
   of teaching CS concepts to students. The lack of more suitable teaching
   materials and limited classroom time are the main reasons for the
   software-based teaching practices. This study proposes a pre-class
   video viewing of the lecture content plus in-class supervised
   laboratory work as a model that can overcome the above problems.
   Experiments on teaching image processing concepts at two local high
   schools have been conducted. The experimental results show that the
   proposed model is a feasible and effective way for the teaching and
   learning of image processing. The new approach also facilitates
   student-student and student-teacher interactions in the classroom.
   Finally, an improvement in the understanding of the subject by the
   students and an increased interest toward learning CS are also evident.

AB Designing specifications for technically advanced instructional
   products, such as e-learning, simulations or simulators requires
   different kinds of expertise. The SLIM method proposes to involve all
   stakeholders from the beginning in a series of workshops under the
   guidance of experienced instructional designers. These instructional
   designers ensure that specifications are designed in a systematic,
   iterative, way based on instructional design and development models.
   The workshop participants, however, bring in all the necessary
   information and they take all the decisions. The SLIM method is geared
   towards the first phase of the instructional design process: designing
   a needs statement in the form of a first set of global user
   requirements. It has been used in eight case studies. The results of
   these case studies have led to improvements to the method and
   suggestions for further research. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

ID INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY USAGE; ACCEPTANCE MODEL; SUCCESS
AB Prior empirical studies in the implementation of general information
   technologies (IT) have revealed that IT adoption and usage were
   determined by user beliefs and attitudes. However, little is known
   about how user beliefs and attitudes form and change over time. To
   address these issues, this paper reports a study of 481 inexperienced
   and 120 experienced potential users on learning objects. Technology
   acceptance model's constructs were used to conduct a longitudinal study
   across three phases (introduction, training and direct-use experience)
   to examine the formation and the changes in users' beliefs and
   behavioral intention to use learning objects over time. The results
   showed that the rates of changes in users' beliefs and behavioral
   intention toward learning objects usage were time-variant and were more
   predominant during the early stage (introduction to training) of
   learning objects usage than in the later stages (training to direct-use
   experience). The study confirmed that initial exposure through
   introduction and training was effective in improving inexperienced
   users' beliefs and intentions to use learning objects. It also helped
   to reduce the belief and intention gaps that existed between
   experienced and inexperienced users. in addition, the influence of
   initial introduction and training on users' beliefs and perceptions was
   sustained over time, thus further indicating their importance. (C) 2008

AB User interfaces are becoming more intuitive following the requirements
   of the individual learner and reinforcing the drive towards more
   personalised learning and greater learner autonomy. There are clearly a
   new set of challenges emerging for teaching practitioners that will
   have implications upon not just what is learned but importantly upon
   lesson planning. This paper explores these changes to teaching through
   a consideration of an exploratory learning model which allows
   practitioners to rethink how they teach in 3D and immersive spaces
   where learning sequences and experiences are choreographed to support
   peer interactions and exchanges. The ELM extends from Kolb's
   experiential learning model to adapt the use of 3D applications, and
   provides examples from research and development projects to exemplify
   how the model works in practice. Teaching in these contexts provides
   less emphasis upon curriculum and more emphasis upon sequencing
   learning experiences, meta-reflection, peer assessment and group work.

AB The researchers investigated the comparative effects of
   individually-constructed and collaboratively-constructed computer-based
   concept mapping on middle school science concept learning. One hundred
   and sixty one students completed the entire study. Using prior science
   performance scores to assure equivalence of student achievement across
   groups, students were assigned to three groups: a self-selected study
   strategy group, an individual-concept mapping group, and a
   collaborative pairs-concept mapping group. Collaboratively and
   individually-constructing computer-based concept maps had equally
   positive effects on seventh grade middle school science concept
   learning as measured on a comprehension test. However, the students who
   collaboratively constructed concept maps created significantly higher
   quality concept maps than those who individually constructed concept
   maps indicating deeper conceptual understanding. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Can modem, computer-based technology engage college students and
   improve their academic achievement in college? Although numerous
   examples detail technology's classroom uses, few studies empirically
   examine whether technologically oriented pedagogical changes factually
   lead to positive outcomes among college students. In this pilot study,
   we used a quasi-experimental design to examine whether a technology
   enhanced research methods classroom led to increased student engagement
   and academic achievement among college students. Two features generally
   characterized the technology enhanced classroom experience: specific
   feedback generated from recordings of small group discussions and
   podcasts of class recordings. Technology enhanced classroom students
   demonstrated statistically significant increases in student engagement
   and improved academic achievement. These findings support previous
   efforts to use technology to enhance engagement and achievement among
   college students and they encourage future efforts. (C) 2008 Published

AB Mobile learning or m-learning, a relatively new concept, has attracted
   the interest of educators, researchers, and companies developing
   learning systems and instructional materials. This study investigated
   the use of integrating use of mobile technologies, data services, and
   multimedia messaging systems to increase students' use of mobile
   technologies and to develop environmental awareness. Data was collected
   using "usefulness of mobile learning systems" questionnaire from a
   sample consisting of 20 male and 21 female undergraduates enrolled in
   computer education and instructional technologies classes at the Near
   East University in North Cyprus. Students voluntarily participated in a
   six-week program using mobile telephones to transmit photographs of
   local environmental blights and to exchange pictures and observations.
   Participants learned ways to maintain clean environments and increased
   their awareness of environmental concerns. Responses on questionnaire
   differed significantly based upon gender and grade. (C) 2008 Elsevier

AB This research aims to determine whether the use of specific types of
   visualization (3D illustration, 3D animation, and interactive 3D
   animation) combined with narration and text, contributes to the
   learning process of 13- and 14- years-old students in science courses.
   The study was carried out with 212 8th grade students in Greece. This
   exploratory study utilizes three different versions of an interactive
   multimedia application called "Methods of separation of mixtures", each
   one differing from the other two in a type of visuals. The results
   indicate that multimedia applications with interactive 3D animations as
   well as with 3D animations do in fact increase the interest of students
   and make the material more appealing to them. The findings also suggest
   that the most obvious and essential benefit of static visuals (3D
   illustrations) is that they leave the time control of learning to the
   students and decrease the cognitive load. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB This study examines an alternative function of information sharing -
   social construction of meaning. Drawing on social construction. social
   interaction, and task closure theories, we explored the influence of
   both the media environment in which students are situated and the
   medium that group members choose to communicate with one another on the
   intricate relationships among breadth of information sharing, depth of
   information sharing, and performance of computer-supported
   collaborative learning (CSCL). A total of 126 students participated in
   the experiment - including 63 students (15 groups of four students and
   one group of three Students) in the control and experimental groups
   respectively. Our findings show that most of the proposed hypotheses
   are supported. Intersubjective interpretation underlies groups
   information sharing and plays a key role in student learning
   performance. Evidence shows that when facing a relatively complex task
   in multimedia environments, students who choose to utilize a medium
   lower in social presence (i.e., electronic information sharing) are
   more likely to achieve task closure than a medium higher in social
   presence (i.e., verbal information sharing). This in turn leads to
   higher learning performance. The implications for both theory and
   pedagogy are also discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Email is now commonplace in the university environment, but little
   research has addressed the impact of this technology on the work-life
   experiences of Teaching Assistants (TAs). These workers are of interest
   as they are typically responsible for most day-to-day, routine
   interaction with undergraduates, for ensuring students understand
   lectures and other course materials, and for assessing student work. In
   the summer of 2006, we undertook a web-based survey of Teaching
   Assistants at a major Canadian university. We wanted to examine the
   impact of and experience with information and communication
   technologies (ICTs) - in this case, the ubiquitous email. We found that
   these academic workers made extensive use of email, and that their
   experiences and attitudes were mixed. While relatively few expressed a
   desire to completely eliminate email use in their practice, problems
   such as feeling 'overburdened' by student email were common.
   Respondents who had set in-person office hours were twice as likely to
   assert that email increased their workload, that they felt overburdened
   by student email, and that they preferred not to communicate with
   students over email. There were also unexpected differences among TAs
   in the arts/social sciences compared to those in the math/science
   disciplines. Our data calls into question the largely optimistic
   orientation common in research reporting at the nexus point of
   education and ICTs, and suggests that an approach that is both critical
   and constructive is warranted when thinking about technology and
   academic work-life. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article presents a study carried out in the area of distance
   learning electronic forums. Based on the relevant bibliographic review,
   electronic forums are increasingly becoming part of the learning
   process. The specific study was stimulated by previous works relevant
   to the modelling of the behaviour of IT students at Hellenic Open
   University (HOU) and addresses the issue of distance learning forum
   modelling using a formal language, aiming to fill the gap that exists
   in this area, which is demonstrated by the relevant bibliographic
   review.
   For this purpose: (a) a relevant note was submitted to HOU's forums,
   (b) the main concepts of formal languages were specified, (c) a formal
   language was created which was specified using mathematical terms and
   represents the messages of HOU's forum, (d) the correctness of such
   language was verified using specific examples of its function, (e) a
   language syntactic check algorithm was designed, (f) the parameters
   impacting on the effectiveness of a distance learning forum were
   determined, (g) concepts such as time, group size and volume of
   information were incorporated into the language and (h) efforts were
   made to identify the factors impacting on the effectiveness of a
   distance learning forum and the following concepts were incorporated:
   time, group size and volume of information, in the language. (C) 2008

DE Game-based learning; Location-based technology; Narrative;
   Storification; History education
AB A mobile and multimedia game designed for History education was
   analyzed in terms of how it is designed and how it was applied as a
   narrative learning environment. In History education, narrative can be
   argued to be very useful to overcome fragmentation of the knowledge of
   historical characters and events, by relating these with meaningful
   connections of temporality and sequence (storification). In the game
   studied, students explore the history of Amsterdam by walking in the
   city, experiencing characters, buildings, and events, while using
   UMTS/GPS phones for communication and exchange of information. The
   History game was played during one day by 216 students, spread over 10
   secondary school classes, in groups of four or five students. All
   information exchanged during the games was collected, and the game play
   and introduction of the game was observed by team coaches and
   researchers. The design of the game as well as the actual gaming
   process was analyzed with respect to how it evoked three types of
   storification: receiving (spectator), constructing (director) and
   participating in (actor) the story. Results show that the game evoked a
   mixture of these three types of storification. Moreover, these types of
   storification processes differently affected students' engagement.
   Participating in the story evoked high activity in the game but less
   awareness of the whole story, whereas constructing the story triggered
   awareness of the whole story. Compared to receiving the story, both
   these types positively affected the engagement of the students being
   active and motivated during the game. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This paper presents a study carried out at the University of the Basque
   Country UPV/EHU with the aim of evaluating the CM-ED (concept map
   editor) with social education students. Concept mapping is a widely
   accepted technique that promotes meaningful learning. Graphically
   representing concepts of the learning domain and relationships between
   them helps students integrate new knowledge into their current
   cognitive structure. Due to the flexibility of computer-aided drawing
   graphs, several concept mapping tools have been developed and their use
   has been studied over the last few years. CM-ED is a multilingual and
   multimedia software program designed for drawing concept maps. Until
   recently, CM-ED had been mainly used and evaluated in computer science
   university degree. This paper represents a qualitative step in the
   evaluation of CM-ED: from technical students to students of more
   theoretical fields. The main characteristics of the CM-ED editor and

   school education; Secondary school education
AB As more schools adopt the use of handheld computers in their
   classrooms, research that systematically tracks their introduction is
   essential in order to develop a model for successful implementation
   leading to improved classroom teaching. This research report seeks to
   explore the realities of introducing and integrating handheld computers
   into five Victorian schools in Australia where the initiative is owned
   and funded by the schools themselves. The research focused on how
   teachers' attitudes and beliefs evolved over about 6-7 months of
   implementing the pocket PCs in their teaching. The findings indicated
   that the effect of pocket PCs on the attitudes of primary teachers were
   mixed while that on the secondary teachers was uncertainty. However,
   both primary and secondary teachers shared similar beliefs in the
   motivational aspect of the technology on student engagement and its
   capacity to cater for weaker students, particularly in English, but not
   for the more academic students. Issues such as leadership roles, the
   time-consuming nature of lesson preparation, the need to integrate
   higher-order thinking tasks with pocket PC usage and personal ownership
   for successful integration of the technology are discussed. Crown

ID CONSTRUCTION; FORUMS
AB As course management systems (CMS) gain popularity in facilitating
   teaching. A forum is a key component to facilitate the interactions
   among students and teachers. Content analysis is the most popular way
   to study a discussion forum. But content analysis is a human labor
   intensity process; for example, the coding process relies heavily on
   manual interpretation; and it is time and energy consuming. In an
   asynchronous virtual learning environment, an instructor needs to keep
   monitoring the discussion forum from time to time in order to maintain
   the quality of a discussion forum. However, it is time consuming and
   difficult for instructors to fulfill this need especially for K12
   teachers. This research proposes a genre classification system, called
   GCS, to facilitate the automatic coding process. We treat the coding
   process as a document classification task via modern data mining
   techniques. The genre of a posting can be perceived as an announcement,
   a question, clarification, interpretation, conflict, assertion, etc.
   This research examines the coding coherence between GCS and experts'
   judgment in terms of recall and precision, and discusses how we adjust
   the parameters of the GCS to improve the coherence. Based on the
   empirical results, GCS adopts the cascade classification model to
   achieve the automatic coding process. The empirical evaluation of the
   classified genres from a repository of postings in an online course on
   earth science in a senior high school shows that GCS can effectively
   facilitate the coding process, and the proposed cascade model can deal
   with the imbalanced distribution nature of discussion postings. These
   results imply that GCS based on the cascade model can perform as an
   automatic posting coding system. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   PERSPECTIVE
AB Learning management systems (LMSs) are very widely used in higher
   education. However, much of the research on LMSs has had a technology
   focus or has been limited to studies of adoption. In order to take
   advantage of the potential associated with LMSs, research that
   addresses the role of LMSs in learning success is needed.
   Task-technology fit is one factor that has been shown to influence both
   the use of information systems and their performance impacts. The study
   described in this paper used the technology-to-performance chain as a
   framework to address the question of how task-technology fit influences
   the performance impacts of LMSs. The results provide strong support for
   the importance of task-technology fit, which influenced perceived
   impact on learning both directly and indirectly via level of
   utilization. Whilst task-technology fit had a strong influence on
   perceived impact of the LMS on learning it only had a weak impact on
   outcomes in terms of student grades. Contrary to expectations,
   facilitating conditions and common social norms did not play a role in
   the performance impacts of LMSs. However, instructor norms had a
   significant effect on perceived impact on learning via LMS utilization.

AB This case study illustrates the sequential process of the joint and

   learning (CSCL) environment. The case comprised an Internet-based
   physics problem-solving platform. Six Dutch secondary school students
   (three males, three females) participated in the three-week experiment.
   They were paired based on self-selection. Each dyad was asked to
   collaborate on eight moderately structured problems concerning
   Newtonian mechanics. Their online interactions, including their textual
   and pictorial messages, were categorized and sequentially plotted. The
   three dyads showed three different collaboration patterns in terms of
   joint and individual knowledge elaboration. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The period since the 1960s has seen dramatic change in the nature and
   practice of science, science education and secondary school education
   itself. This paper examines changes in the Science for All movement,
   setting these changes in the context of the societal shift towards
   market liberalism and the advancement of a new style of individualism.
   We argue that the climate of today requires a re-focusing of the
   priorities of secondary school science education, with a new emphasis
   on what Science for All implies for the education of those who will go
   on to be our scientific elite.

AB This longitudinal case study describes the factors that affect an
   experienced teacher's attempt to shift her pedagogical practices in
   order to implement embedded elements of argument into her science
   classroom. Research data was accumulated over 2 years through video
   recordings of science classes. The Reformed Teacher Observation
   Protocol (RTOP) is an instrument designed to quantify changes in
   classroom environments as related to reform as defined by the National
   Research Council (National science education standards. Washington, DC:
   National Academy Press, 1996b) and the National Research Council
   (Fulfilling the promise: Biology education in the nation's schools,
   Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 1990) and was used to analyze
   videotaped science lessons. Analysis of the data shows that there was a
   significant shift in the areas of teacher questioning, and student
   voice. Several levels of subsequent analysis were completed related to
   teacher questioning and student voice. The data suggests a relationship
   between these areas and the implementation of scientific argument.
   Results indicate that the teacher moved from a traditional,
   teacher-centered, didactic teaching style to instructional practices
   that allowed the focus and direction of the lesson to be affected by
   student voice. This was accomplished by a change in teacher questioning
   that included a shift from factual recall to more divergent questioning
   patterns allowing for increased student voice. As student voice
   increased, students began to investigate ideas, make statements or
   claims and to support these claims with strong evidence. Finally,
   students were observed refuting claims in the form of rebuttals. This
   study informs professional development related to experienced teachers
   in that it highlights pedagogical issues involved in implementing
   embedded elements of argument in the elementary classroom.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate whether participation in
   sensorimotor activities by preschool children involving their own
   bodily balance while walking on a beam over the floor has an effect on
   their understanding of the mechanical equilibrium of a balance beam.
   The balance beam consisted of a horizontal stick balancing around its
   center of mass (middle point), while carrying equal-weight objects on
   either side of it. The study utilized a two-group design, and was
   conducted in three phases (pre-test, treatment and post-test). The
   results of the study provide evidence that there was such an effect,
   since the children (who participated in the sensorimotor activities)
   could select out of a number of objects those two with the same weight
   regardless of their shape, size or colour, in order to balance the
   stick. This effect also can be seen when a comparison is made with a
   second group of children, which had previously participated in a
   hands-on activity regarding the equilibrium of a similar balance beam,
   and which (children), therefore, had a definite advantage over the
   other children who had participated in the sensorimotor activity. A Chi
   Square Test showed no significant differences between the two groups on
   both an immediate and a delayed post-test, while the McNemar Test for
   the Significance of Change showed a statistically significant
   difference (that is, a negative change in performance between the first
   and the second post-test) only within the hands-on group. This
   difference represents evidence that the children from the sensorimotor
   group remembered better the rule they were applying (i.e., selecting
   equal-weight objects) in order to balance the beam.

AB This research, carried out in Greece on pupils aged 12-16, focuses on
   the transformation of their representations concerning light emission
   and image formation by extended light sources. The instructive process
   was carried out in two stages, each one having a different, distinct
   target set. During the first stage, the appropriate conflict conditions
   were created by contrasting the subjects' predictions with the results
   of experimental situations inspired by the History of Science, with a
   view to destabilizing the pupils' alternative representations. During
   the second stage, the experimental teaching intervention was carried
   out; it was based on the geometrical optics model and its parameters
   were derived from Kepler's relevant historic experiment. For the
   duration of this process and within the framework of didactical
   interactions, an effort was made to reorganize initial limited
   representations and restructure them at the level of the accepted
   scientific model. The effectiveness of the intervention was evaluated
   two weeks later, using experimental tasks which had the same cognitive
   yet different empirical content with respect to the tasks conducted
   during the intervention. The results of the study showed that the
   majority of the subjects accepted the model of geometrical optics, that
   is, the pupils were able to correctly predict and adequately justify
   the experimental results based on the principle of punctiform light
   emission. Educational and research implications are discussed.

AB The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the interaction
   effect between grade level and gender with respect to students'
   attitudes toward chemistry lessons taught in secondary schools. The
   sample consisted of 954 chemistry students in grades Secondary 4-7
   (approximately 16-19 years of age) in Hong Kong. Students' attitudes
   were surveyed using an attitude toward chemistry lessons scale (ATCLS),
   and subscale scores were produced on four dimensions: liking for
   chemistry theory lessons; liking for chemistry laboratory work;
   evaluative beliefs about school chemistry; and behavioral tendencies to
   learn chemistry. When the ATCLS data were subjected to two-way MANOVA,
   the interaction effect between grade level and gender on students'
   attitudes toward chemistry lessons was statistically significant. The
   interaction effect was attributable to scores on the theory lessons
   subscale and laboratory work subscale. Male students in Secondary 4 and
   5 liked chemistry theory lessons more than their female counterparts.
   However, male students' liking for chemistry laboratory work declined
   when they progressed from Secondary 4 to Secondary 7; no such a
   significant decline in attitude toward chemistry laboratory work was
   found in females. Overall, both males and females were just marginally
   positive about chemistry lessons during the years of secondary
   schooling. Implications of these findings for curriculum design are
   discussed.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB Results of various studies suggest that multimedia 'case methods'
   (activities associated with case documentaries) have many benefits in
   university-based teacher education contexts. They can, for example,
   help to 'bridge the gap' between perspectives and practices held by
   academic teacher educators and those held by student-teachers - who may
   adhere to perspectives and practices commonly supported in schools. On
   the other hand, some studies, along with theoretical arguments, suggest
   that there are limits to the effectiveness of multimedia case methods -
   because, for example, they can never fully represent realities of
   teaching and learning in schools. Furthermore, often missing from
   multimedia case methods is the student-teacher in the role of teacher.
   To address these concerns, we modified an existing multimedia case
   method by associating it with a special practice teaching situation in
   a school context. Qualitative data analyzed using constant comparative
   methods suggest that student-teachers engaged in this modified
   multimedia case method developed relatively deep commitments to
   encouraging students to conduct technology design projects - a
   non-traditional practice in school science. Factors that appeared to
   influence development of this motivation included student-teachers'
   pre-instructional perspectives about science and the personalization
   and contextualization inherent to the modified multimedia case method.

AB Investigation of scientists' actual processes of conducting research
   can provide us with more realistic aspects of scientific inquiry. This
   study was performed to identify three aspects of scientists' actual
   research: their motivations for scientific inquiry, the scientific
   inquiry skills they used, and the main types of results obtained from
   their research. To do this, we interviewed six prominent physicists
   about why and how they researched and what they obtained from their
   research results. We also analyzed their published papers. In the
   previous part of this study, types and features of the physicists'
   research motivations were identified (Park and Jang, Journal of the
   Korean Physical Society, 47(3), 401-408, 2005). In this article, as the
   second part of the study, it was found: (1) Various inquiry skills
   including theoretical as well as experimental research skills and the
   social skills of scientific inquiry were used in physicists' research.
   (2) New inventions, articulation of, and falsification of the previous
   findings were regarded as important research results. (3) Physicists'
   research processes were often non-linear and cyclical. For each of
   these findings, implications for teaching scientific inquiry in schools
   were developed. Finally, we proposed a model of scientific inquiry
   process consisting of research motives, scientific inquiry skills, and
   results of inquiry.

AB In the new science and technology junior-high-school curriculum in
   Israel, it is recommended that the cell topic be taught "longitudinally
   in conjunction with other study contents". This recommendation confers
   a change in teaching the cell topic and provides an opportunity to form
   meaningful relationships between biological phenomena at the
   macro-level and their cellular explanations. Here, we examine
   junior-high-school science and technology teachers' pedagogical content
   knowledge (PCK) with regard to the cell topic and the formation of
   macro-micro relations, ten years following the publication of the
   change in the curriculum. Teachers in this study participated in three
   focus groups (n = 59) and one workshop (n = 12). In addition, six
   experienced teachers were interviewed in the course of this study.
   Specific tools were developed to capture the teachers' PCK. We found
   that the teachers had changed their way of teaching the cell topic only
   superficially: they did not undergo any deep change. Despite the
   importance the teachers placed on teaching and learning the cell topic,
   their concerns about their students' comprehension difficulties reduced
   the time they devoted to teaching the topic in class. The teachers were
   also found to have no PCK capacity to integrate biological phenomena at
   the macro-level with their cellular explanations. In addition, a
   duality was identified among the teachers with regards to relating
   macro- and micro-levels in biology and in chemistry.

TI Narrative and learning with Web 2.0 technologies: towards a research
   agenda
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE blogs; knowledge; learning; narrative; Web 2.0
AB This paper investigates the impact of Web. 2.0 technologies on the ways
   learning can be conceived of as a narrative process within contemporary
   contexts, using blogs as an illustrative example. It is premised on the
   concept of narrative as a way in which individuals represent and
   organize experience in order to learn from it and make it shareable
   with others within social contexts. The first part of the paper offers
   a theoretical analysis of the role of narrative in the social
   construction of knowledge by the ways it enables users of Web 2.0
   technologies to participate meaningfully in the exchange of experiences
   and ideas. The second part of the paper offers a 'situated' analysis of
   the narrative practices engaged with by users of blogs. A 'narrative
   trail' is used to provide a contextualized instance of the narrative
   practices which are involved. The paper concludes by examining the
   research issues which are raised and suggests a research agenda which
   is needed to explore Web 2.0 technologies as social utilities affecting
   knowledge production, in which the adaptation of narrative theory is a
   central feature.

DE Digital pedagogies; repurposing; social technologies; wikis; weblogs
AB This paper presents some of the findings from a recent project that
   conducted a virtual ethnographic study of three formal courses in
   higher education that use 'Web 2.0' or social technologies for learning
   and teaching. It describes the pedagogies adopted within these courses,
   and goes on to explore some key themes emerging from the research and
   relating to the pedagogical use of weblogs and wikis in particular.
   These themes relate primarily to the academy's tendency to constrain
   and contain the possibly more radical effects of these new spaces.
   Despite this, the findings present a range of student and tutor
   perspectives which show that these technologies have significant
   potential as new collaborative, volatile and challenging environments
   for formal learning.

DT Article
DE blogging; blogs; distance learning; higher education; learning design
AB We report on a study involving Masters-level students who blogged as a
   part of a distance-learning course at the Open University, UK. We
   present an empirically-grounded framework that can be used to guide
   educators when they are considering blogging as part of their courses,
   and can be used by students' whose courses include blogging activities.
   In our analysis of semi-structured interviews with students, we
   identified six factors that influenced their blogging: perceptions of,
   and need for, an audience; perceptions of, and need for, community; the
   utility of, and need for comments; presentational style of the blog
   content; overarching factors related to the technological context; and
   the pedagogical context of the course. The students' blogging
   behaviours were varied and depended upon the way in which they
   addressed each of the six factors. These factors, along with the
   associated questions in the proposed framework, provide insights about
   the activity of blogging from a student's perspective. Therefore, the
   framework can guide the design of blogging activities in courses.

DE collaborative learning; co-writing; evaluation; networked learning;
   social software; university teaching
AB One critical issue arising in the educational use of collaborative
   learning concerns the teacher's difficulty in evaluating the
   contribution and participation of each student in group-work. This
   article aims to illustrate and discuss a methodology that enables
   evaluation of the collaborative learning process based on co-writing in
   a wiki environment. After considering the effectiveness of co-writing
   as a strategy of collaborative learning, the article will highlight
   issues regarding methods for evaluating each student's contribution to
   the collaborative process and to the group's overall action. A solution
   will be proposed to address the problem. It is based upon the
   elaboration of information traced automatically by wiki, employing
   survey grids and formulae developed ad hoc to calculate participation
   and contribution indexes. These tools will be illustrated together with
   their application in two university courses. Results demonstrate the
   added value given by the proposed approach to the evaluation process of
   co-writing. However, these findings also highlight critical issues and
   some possible remedies for the lack of specific wiki functions to
   automatically extract information required for quantitative analysis of
   the actions taken by members of the learning group.

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE boundary crossing; digital dissonance; digital technologies; learning
   contexts; Web 2.0
AB Boundaries between formal and informal learning settings are shaped by
   influences beyond learners' control. This can lead to the proscription
   of some familiar technologies that learners may like to use from some
   learning settings. This contested demarcation is not well documented.
   In this paper, we introduce the term 'digital dissonance' to describe
   this tension with respect to learners' appropriation of Web 2.0
   technologies in formal contexts. We present the results of a study that
   explores learners' in- and out-of-school use of Web 2.0 and related
   technologies. The study comprises two data sources: a questionnaire and
   a mapping activity. The contexts within which learners felt their
   technologies were appropriate or able to be used are also explored.
   Results of the study show that a sense of 'digital dissonance' occurs
   around learners' experience of Web 2.0 activity in and out of school.
   Many learners routinely cross institutionally demarcated boundaries,
   but the implications of this activity are not well understood by
   institutions or indeed by learners themselves. More needs to be
   understood about the transferability of Web 2.0 skill sets and ways in
   which these can be used to support formal learning.

DE Web 2.0; e-safety; social network; education policy
AB This paper reports findings from a survey and interviews with children
   aged 11-16 years, teachers and parents on their attitudes to e-safety
   in relation to social networking and media creation (Web 2.0) and their
   practices at school and at home. The results showed that 74% of the
   children surveyed have used social network (SN) sites and that a
   substantial minority regularly interact socially online with people
   they have not met face-to-face. Online interaction forms a different,
   although overlapping, social space to that of face-to-face friendships.
   Despite a desire from some teachers to explore the benefits of Web 2.0
   for creative and social learning, they report being constrained by a
   need to show a duty of care that avoids worst-case risk to children, to
   restrict access to SN sites. The respondents also report more direct
   concerns about Internet bullying and exam cheating. We also report a
   Policy Delphi process with a panel of 30 people with expertise in Web
   2.0 and e-safety. The panel reached a general consensus that schools
   should move towards allowing access to Web 2.0 sites, with children
   being educated in responsible and creative learning.

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE argumentation; functional linguistics; language; text-based conferencing
ID ARGUMENTATION; PATTERNS
AB The ability to argue is an important academic goal in secondary
   education. This paper reports on an exploratory study which
   investigated how asynchronous text-based conferencing provides a new
   site for school students to rehearse and develop their skills in
   argumentation. The study used linguistic tools of analysis to
   investigate two key questions:
   How is argumentation structured in asynchronous text-based conferencing?
   How do students use language to negotiate their position on an issue?
   The originality of our study lies in the use of a functional linguistic
   method of analysis which provides unique insights into how students use
   language to argue, insights that can inform teaching and learning both
   in school history (the context for this paper) and more generally. Our
   interest in language is based on the premise that it is central to the
   learning process - a premise supported by work in socio-cultural
   psychology and systemic functional linguistics.
   The most significant findings to emerge from the analysis were that (1)
   counter-argumentation was rare; and (2b) the more tentatively a claim
   is phrased the more likely it is that students will challenge or
   counter it.

TI A Disciplinary Discourse Perspective on University Science Learning:
   Achieving Fluency in a Critical Constellation of Modes

AB In this theoretical article we use an interpretative study with physics
   undergraduates to exemplify a proposed characterization of student
   learning in university science in terms of fluency in "disciplinary
   discourse" as the on ideas from a number of different sources in the
   literature, we characterize what we call "disciplinary discourse" as
   the complex of representations, tools and activities of a discipline,
   describing how it can be seen as being made up of various "modes". For
   university science, examples of these modes are: spoken and written
   language, mathematics, gesture, images (including pictures, graphs and
   diagrams), tools (such as experimental apparatus and measurement
   equipment), and activities (such as ways of working-both practice and
   praxis, analytical routines, actions, etc.). Using physics as an
   illustrative example, we discuss the relationship between the ways of
   knowing that constitute a discipline and the modes of disciplinary
   discourse used to represent this knowing. The data comes from
   stimulated recall interviews where physics undergraduates discuss their
   learning experiences during lectures. These interviews are used to
   anecdotally illustrate our proposed characterization of learning and
   its associated theorectical constructs. Students describe a repetitive
   practice aspect to their learning, which we suggest is necessary for
   achieving fluency in the various modes of disciplinary discourse. Here
   we found instances of discourse imitation, where students are seemingly
   fluent in one or more modes of disciplinary discourse without having
   related this to a teacher-intented disciplinary way of knowing. The
   examples lead to the suggestion that fluency in a critical
   constellation of modes of disciplinary discourse may be a necessary
   (though not always sufficient) condition for gaining meaningful
   holistic access to disciplinary ways of knowing. One implication is
   that in order to be effective, science teachers need to know which
   modes are critical for an understanding of the material they wish to
   teach. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 46: 27-49, 2009

AB The findings reported of in this manuscript emerged from a design
   experiment conducted at a low-income urban middle school intended to
   support the teacher in incorporating, Pedagogical Practices supportive
   of students' everyday knowledge and Practices during, a 6th grade unit
   on food and nutrition from the LiFE curriculum. In studying the impact
   of the design experiment we noticed qualitative shifts in classroom
   Discourse marked by a changing role and understandings of the funds of
   knowledge students brought to science learning. Using qualitative
   grounded theory we present an analysis of the different types of funds
   of knowledge and Discourse that students brought into science class. We
   focus on how the students strategic use of these funds augmented the
   learning experience of the students and the learning community as well
   as the learning outcomes. We discuss the implications these funds of
   knowledge and Discourses had on the development of three related third
   space transformations; physical, political, and Pedagogical. (C) 2008

AB The purpose of this investigation was to explore possible relationships
   between Socioscientific Issues instruction and students' development of
   reflective judgement. The useful of the Reflective Judgment Model as a
   tool for assessing the value of SSI is established in the parallels
   that can be drawn between them. Both involve ill-structured problems
   requiring evidence-based reasoning subject to differing interpretations
   by students, and both require examination, analysis and the blending of
   scientific and normative evidence, as students use that evidence to
   support a reasoned position. Results demonstrated both qualitative
   evidence revealing more sophisticated and nuanced epistemological
   stances toward higher stages of reflective judgement, as well as
   statistically significant gains within treatment groups with a
   moderately large effect size. Theoretical implications for advancing
   students' epistemological beliefs about evidence-based argumentation
   and pedagogical implications for rethinking how to connect science with
   topics that are fundamentally meaningful to students are discussed. (C)

AB This study examined the influence of field placements settings with
   varying demographic profiles on preservice elementary teachers. Data
   were gathered at three points during the participants' final year in
   their teacher preparation program in order to chart changes over time
   in science teaching self-efficacy beliefs. These measures were
   supplemented by interviews to chart changes over time in science
   teaching self-efficacy beliefs. These measures were (2000) and the
   dimensions of teacher development described by Bullough et al.
   [Bullough et. al. [2004] Teachers and Teaching: Theory and Practice
   10:305-394] were employed as interpretive tools. Statistical analyses
   of teaching self-efficacy scores revealed marginal changes over time.
   Individual interviews revealed no discernible influence upon the
   teacher candidates' perceptions of science teaching selves that could
   be attributed to the demographics of their field placememts. Emerging
   from this study was the previously underappreciated value of self-doubt
   as a factor in motivating preservice teachers. The findings call into
   question the tendency to use heightened teaching self-efficacy as an
   indicator of individual or programmatic success. This examination of
   preservice teacher development over the final year of a preparatory
   program, especially when considered in light of student diversity,
   demonstrates the soundness of Dewey's claim that uncertainty is a
   crucial component of learning and knowing. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals.

TI Lab Technicians and High School Student Interns-Who Is Scaffolding
   Whom?: On Forms of Emergent Expertise
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English

ID SCIENCE INQUIRY; APPRENTICESHIP; KNOWLEDGE; PARTICIPATION; FRAMEWORK;
   DESIGN; TASKS
AB Apprenticeship and the associated support mechanism of scaffolding have
   received considerable interest by educational researchers as ways of
   inducting students into science. Most Studies treat scat-folding as a
   one-way process, where the expert supports the development of the
   novice. However, if social processes generally and conversations
   specifically are dialogical in nature then we would expect to observe
   two-way processes. The purpose of this paper is to report the results
   of an ethnographic study of high school students' internships in a
   scientific laboratory. Data were collected through observation,
   fieldnotes, and videotaping. Drawing oil discursive psychology and
   conversation analysis, we find that laboratory technicians and students
   draw on different forms of discursive strategies to articulate
   knowledgeability while transacting with each other. We put forth the
   notion of emergent expertise to describe new forms of expertise that
   are not a property of individuals but rather the product of collective
   transactions. Our study illustrates the importance of opportunities
   generated in the internship for both old-timers and newcomers to bring
   about knowledgeability. This study implies a rethinking of the role of
   the expert and the notion of scaffolding, which puts more emphasis oil
   the transactional process rather than on learners as recipients. (C)

ID SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATIONS; INQUIRY; SCIENCE; CLASSROOMS; SCAFFOLDS;

AB Constructing scientific explanations and participating in argumentative
   discourse are seen as essential practices of scientific inquiry (e.g.,
   R. Driver, P. Newton, & J. Osborne, 2000). In this paper, we identify
   three goals of engaging in these related scientific practices: (1)
   sensemaking, (2) articulating, and (3) persuading. We propose using
   these goals to understand student engagement with these practices, and
   to design instructional interventions to support students. Thus, we use
   this framework as a lens to investigate the question: What successes
   and challenges do students face as they engage in the scientific
   practices of explanation and argumentation? We study this in the
   context of a curriculum that provides students and teachers with an
   instructional framework for constructing and defending scientific
   explanations. Through this analysis, we find that students consistently
   use evidence to make sense of phenomenon and articulate those
   understandings but they do not consistently attend to the third goal of
   persuading others of their understandings. Examining the third goal
   more closely reveals that persuading others of an understanding
   requires social interactions that are often inhibited by traditional
   classroom interactions. Thus, we conclude by proposing design
   strategies for addressing the social challenges inherent in the related
   scientific practices of explanation and argumentation. (C) 2008 Wiley

AB Preliminary pilot studies and a field study show how a generalizable
   conceptual framework calibrated with item response modeling can be used
   to describe the development of student conceptual understanding in
   chemistry. ChemQuery is an assessment system that uses a framework of
   the key ideas in the discipline, called the Perspectives of Chemists,
   and criterion-referenced analysis using item response models (item
   response theory (IRT)) to map student progress. It includes assessment
   questions, a scoring rubric, item exemplars, and a framework to
   describe the paths of student understanding that emerge. Integral to
   criterion-referenced measurement is a focus on what is being measured:
   the intention of the assessment, its purpose, and the context in which
   it is going to be used. The Perspectives framework allows us to begin
   to narrate the development of understanding that occurs as students
   "learn" over the course of instruction, helping to form a crosswalk
   among educational science standards and underscore the importance of
   scientific reasoning with domain knowledge. Here, we explain a
   framework we have investigated in chemistry and present evidence on
   measures of student understanding to describe the development of
   conceptual understanding at the high school and university levels. (C)

AB Making assumptions is an important step in solving many real-world
   problems. This study investigated whether participants who could solve
   well-defined physics problems could also solve a real-world physics
   problem that involved the need to make assumptions. The participants,
   who all had at least a BA in physics, were videotaped "thinking aloud"
   while solving three well-defined and one real-world problem and then
   interviewed about the problem-solving process. All the problems dealt
   with the same scientific content. The recordings were analyzed to
   identify similarities and differences in the ways the problems were
   solved and to see which steps in the solution of the problems posed the
   greatest cognitive difficulty for each participant. Results indicate
   that (a) the process of making the constraining assumptions needed to
   convert the real-world problem into a well-defined one was the most
   difficult step for all, and (b) only the participants who had prior
   experience making constraining assumptions were able to make the needed
   assumptions and solve the real-world problem. These findings suggest a
   need to support physics students develop this important skill. (C) 2008

AB This Study sought to identify prominent features of the nature of
   science (NOS) embedded in authentic scientific inquiry. Thirteen
   well-established scientists from different parts of the world, working
   in experimental or theoretical research, in both traditional fields
   such as astrophysics and rapidly growing research fields such as
   molecular biology, completed an open-ended questionnaire about the NOS
   and participated in in-depth interviews. The descriptions of their
   practices provide a somewhat striking contrast to the image of science
   usually portrayed in science curricula and textbooks. These accounts of
   authentic scientific practice have considerable potential for
   development into interesting cases as teaching resources to enhance and
   enrich students' understanding of NOS and for the design of more
   effective laboratory work and field experience. (C) 2008 Wiley

AB What effects do different setups of museum exhibits have on visitors'
   conversations and interactions? The study reported here is an
   investigation of the role that labels and associated materials play in
   visitors' conversations and interactions at a heat camera exhibit.
   After we introduced a label to help visitors explore the insulating
   properties of clothing, we found a dramatic shift in the kinds of
   activities and participation structures of visitors. Not only were
   visitors, as expected, discussing why clothing was warm, but they were
   doing so in a fashion more consistent with formal education than the
   typically more collaborative conversations seen in informal learning
   environments. Overall, our analyses reveal that labels and activities
   presented serve to frame both the activities that visitors engage in
   and the types of conversations that ensue and that this has deep
   influences on visitors' experiences at the exhibit. (C) 2008 Wiley

AB The competency requirements, content, culture, and value systems of
   business and industry career environments can differ significantly from
   that of the higher education context where instructional design and
   technology (IDT) students receive their formal training. Therefore,
   faculty should consider how they might provide flexibility in their
   programs to allow IDT students to experience the contexts in which they
   choose to work following graduation. The article reports on the results
   of a case study of an exemplary IDT program identified through a
   national survey. The emphases and preparation practices of faculty in
   the case study program were noted to provide an example of how one
   program successfully prepares its graduates for a variety of career
   environments, and specifically for a business and industry environment.
   By studying the successes and challenges of specific programs, new or
   existing programs may gain ideas for building or re-working existing
   programs to better meet the needs of students desiring contextualized
   preparation for different career environments.

AB This case study investigated learners' perceptions of value from
   participating in a learning activity designed to model professional
   instructional design practice. Learners developed instructional design
   products for a corporate client in the context of a classroom-based
   course. The findings indicate that learners perceived different kinds
   of value which varied according to the degree of integration of
   learners' goals with client's goals, ranging from (a) co-constituted
   value (in which learners perceived the value of their participation as
   being inextricably bound to creation of value to the client) to (b)
   satisficing value (in which learners engaged with the activity so as to
   generate value for themselves while providing sufficient or good enough
   value to the client) to (c) salvage value (in which learners did not
   participate in the activity in the manner intended, but attempted to
   salvage some personal value from their participation). A framework
   relates these learners' perceptions of value to three main features of
   such learning activities: what you do, how you do it, and who you are
   accountable to. The relative worth of these different kinds of value is
   discussed, and proposals for influencing learner perceptions of value
   are presented.

AB In recent years, considerable attention has been paid to the alleged
   changes in the ways the so-called digital generation communicates and
   learns. Most of the commentary has been based on anecdotes,
   observations and opinions. The lack of empirical evidence in this
   matter suggests that it may be time to begin the process of gathering
   data to confirm these views. At the forefront is the issue of which
   learner characteristics have changed, if any, and, accordingly, which
   evaluation tools are best suited to evaluate them. One mechanism found
   to be valid and reliable is the matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT).
   Developed over thirty years ago to measure cognitive tempo on an
   impulsive-reflective axis, this instrument was subsequently adapted
   into a twenty-question version. Cairns and Cammock, the researchers who
   modified the original into the MFFT-20, published the results of
   several reliability studies to demonstrate its overall effectiveness.
   This preliminary study is an attempt to begin the empirical
   verification process of using cognitive tempo as a relevant assessment
   tool. Two groups of K-12 students from different eras were investigated
   to determine if comparing cognitive tempos between subjects who took
   the original MFFT-20 to those who live in the current media-centric
   society provides any insights as to possible differences in the visual
   cognitive processing skills and preferences. The results of the
   comparative analysis, along with possible implications for teachers and
   instructional designers are discussed.

AB This study was designed to investigate the effects of two instructional
   approaches (whole-task versus part-task) and two levels of learner
   prior knowledge (lower versus higher) on learner acquisition and
   transfer of a complex cognitive skill. Participants were 51
   undergraduate pre-service teachers. In the part-task condition, a
   complex skill (preparing a grade book using Excel) was decomposed into
   a series of smaller tasks, each of which was demonstrated and practiced
   separately. In the whole-task condition, which was based on the
   4C/ID-model (van MerriA << nboer 1997), learners were exposed to the
   entire complex skill from the beginning of the instruction and were
   required to practice performing a series of whole tasks throughout the
   unit. Results indicated that the whole-task group performed
   significantly better than the part-task group on a skill acquisition
   test and a transfer test. Possible reasons for these findings and
   suggestions for future research are discussed.

DE Online literacy; Science education; Reading comprehension
AB High school students can access original scientific research articles
   on the Internet, but may have trouble understanding them. To address
   this problem of online literacy, the authors developed a computer-based
   prototype for guiding students' comprehension of scientific articles.
   High school students were asked to read an original scientific research
   article about the effects of drug or alcohol abuse, which was presented
   on a computer screen either with computer-based comprehension aids or
   without aids. The aids provided background text and animations
   including answers given by the article authors. Across two experiments
   involving different schools and different research articles, the
   comprehension aids group performed better than the control group on a
   comprehension test concerning the article (d = +0.79 in Experiment 1
   and d = +0.82 in Experiment 2) and rated the content of article as less
   difficult to read (d = +0.96 in Experiment 1 and d = +0.69 in
   Experiment 2). In addition, the comprehension aids group reported more
   positive motivational beliefs than the control group concerning
   understanding what scientists do (d = +0.51 in Experiment 1 and d =
   +0.56 in Experiment 2), appraising the article as worthwhile (d = +0.80
   for Experiment 1 and d = +0.70 for Experiment 2), and being interested
   in reading another research article (d = +0.19 in Experiment 1 and d =
   +0.58 in Experiment 2). The groups did not differ on their attitudes
   concerning a career as a scientist or about alcohol and drug abuse.
   Overall, computer-based comprehension aids can help guide students'
   comprehension processes for an original scientific research article,
   which in turn can improve their appreciation of what scientists do.

AB This design-based research study is aimed at two goals: (1) developing
   a feasible case-based instructional model that could enhance college
   students' ill-structured problem solving abilities, while (2)
   implementing the model to improve teacher education students'
   real-world problem solving abilities to deal with dilemmas faced by
   practicing teachers in elementary classrooms. To achieve these goals,
   an online case-based learning environment for classroom management
   problem solving (CBL-CMPS) was developed based on Jonassen's (in:
   Reigeluth (ed.) Instructional-Design Theories and Models: A New
   Paradigm of Instructional Theory, 1999) constructivist learning
   environment model and the general process of ill-structured problem
   solving (1997). Two successive studies, in which the effectiveness of
   the CBL-CMPS was tested while the CBL-CMPS was revised, showed that the
   individual components of the CBL-CMPS promoted ill-structured problem
   solving abilities respectively, and that the CBL-CMPS as a whole
   learning environment was effective to a degree for the transfer of
   learning in ill-structured problem solving. The potential, challenge,
   and implications of the CBL-CMPS are discussed.

ID CHILDREN
AB The current paper provides insight into the learning strategies adopted
   by children working at Minimally Invasive Education (MIE) Learning
   Stations. Previous research has clearly indicated the attainment of
   basic computer literacy by groups of young children in the age groups
   of 7-14 years. This learning takes place due to the emergence and
   development of group social processes, an aspect crucial for achieving
   basic computing skills. The paper describes the process of socially
   shared understanding and learning as being crucial to individual
   learning. It is to be noted that this approach of socially shared
   learning does not challenge the analysis of the individual level of
   processing; it maintains that individual learning is vital in any
   learning context, but insufficient to build the psychology of learning.
   MIE research is of the view that young children learn through
   interaction with others, particularly peers as it provides an important
   context for social and cognitive learning. For it is in this way that
   children make sense of their own experience and environment. Hence,
   schools are not the only privileged sites of learning.

AB The present experiment investigated the effect of three different
   presentation modes in children's vocabulary learning with a self-guided
   multimedia programmes. Participants were 135 third and fourth grade
   children who read a short English language story presented by a
   computer programme. For 12 key (previously unknown) words in the story,
   children received verbal annotations (written translation), visual
   annotations (picture representing the word), or both. Recall of word
   translations was better for children who only received verbal
   annotations than for children who received simultaneously visual and
   verbal annotations or visual annotations only. Results support previous
   research about cognitive load in e-learning environments, and show that
   children's learning processes are hindered by limited working memory.
   This finding implies a challenge for multimedia programmes designed for
   children and based on self-regulated learning.

TI Technology education students: e-tutors for school children
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
AB E-tutoring refers to individualised learning support mediated by
   Internet technology. While increased demand for tutors has led to a
   surge in commercial e-tutoring services, volunteer e-tutoring programs
   for children are rare. To test the viability of volunteer e-tutoring
   for elementary school students, 10 undergraduate students enrolled in a
   technology education (TE) course provided online with instructional
   support to children in need of tutoring services. Each e-tutor was
   assigned a specific child, developed a Web Course Tools course and
   corresponding online activities to improve teacher-identified skill
   deficiencies, and provided 8 weeks of e-tutoring. Three video
   conferences complemented online instructional interaction between
   e-tutor and e-tutee. Children, parents and TE students expressed
   positive evaluation of the initiative.

TI Facilitating Asian students' critical thinking in online discussions
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of the study reported here is to illustrate how an approach
   based on a culturally appropriate 'shepherd metaphor' has helped Asian
   students to cross cultural boundaries and to engage in critical
   thinking online. Asian students are under different levels of influence
   from the Confucian Heritage Culture, which cultivates students to
   revere authority, maintain harmony and avoid conflicts in public. This
   has a significant impact on Asian students' cultural readiness to
   verbalise critical thinking. This paper partially reports research
   undertaken in a large English as a Foreign Language reading class in
   Taiwan, in which 'shepherd leadership' was practised. Shepherd
   leadership involves knowing students individually, offering cognitive
   modelling, exercising leadership and discipleship, encouraging student
   leadership and calling on silent students personally to get them to
   participate. This approach, concentrating on Asian students' affective
   needs, cognitive modelling, passing leadership to students and reaching
   out to silent ones, was found effective.

TI Out of class-out of mind? The use of a virtual learning environment to
   encourage student engagement in out of class activities
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID EXPERIENCE
AB With increasing student numbers and a diverse student body, it is
   crucial to consider a range of methods to engage students in learning
   and teaching activities. This project was used to encourage 1st-year
   undergraduate students to engage in out of class activities between
   taught sessions. The project used a virtual learning environment (VLE)
   known as Wolverhampton Online Learning Framework (WOLF) to encourage
   collaborative working within learning sets. The central aim was to
   investigate the potential to improve communication and mutual support
   between students and also to encourage students to make links between
   taught sessions. They were given weekly tasks that needed to be
   completed within their learning sets and they then posted the work in
   folders within WOLF by a set time. This allowed for timely feedback
   from the tutor and it facilitated sharing of resources across the sets.
   The final element involved students using their new knowledge to
   peer-teach the whole group in short presentations at the beginning of
   the next taught session. Feedback was collected in three ways,
   including focus groups, module feedback forms and a short questionnaire
   about the use of the VLE. Overall, the students' feedback was positive
   and they commented on gaining a number of skills including, using
   technology, group working and presentations. In addition to this, the
   overall pass rate for the module was higher and the average student
   grade had also increased.

DT Article
AB There is an increase use of wireless technologies in education all over
   the world. In fact, wireless technologies such as laptop computers,
   palmtop computers and mobile phones are revolutionising education and
   transforming the traditional classroom-based learning and teaching into
   anytime and anywhere education. This paper investigates the use of
   wireless technologies in education with particular reference to the
   potential of learning new technical English language words using Short
   Message Service (SMS) text messaging. The system, developed by the
   authors, called mobile learning tool (MOLT), has been tested with 45
   1st-year undergraduate students. The knowledge of students before and
   after the experiment has been measured. Our results show that students
   enjoyed and learned new words with the help of their mobile phones. We
   believe that using the MOLT system as an educational tool will
   contribute to the success of students.

   BEHAVIOR; ADOPTION
AB With the proliferation of mobile computing technology, mobile learning
   (m-learning) will play a vital role in the rapidly growing electronic
   learning market. M-learning is the delivery of learning to students
   anytime and anywhere through the use of wireless Internet and mobile
   devices. However, acceptance of m-learning by individuals is critical
   to the successful implementation of m-learning systems. Thus, there is
   a need to research the factors that affect user intention to use
   m-learning. Based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of
   technology (UTAUT), which integrates elements across eight models of
   information technology use, this study was to investigate the
   determinants of m-learning acceptance and to discover if there exist
   either age or gender differences in the acceptance of m-learning, or
   both. Data collected from 330 respondents in Taiwan were tested against
   the research model using the structural equation modelling approach.
   The results indicate that performance expectancy, effort expectancy,
   social influence, perceived playfulness, and self-management of
   learning were all significant determinants of behavioural intention to
   use m-learning. We also found that age differences moderate the effects
   of effort expectancy and social influence on m-learning use intention,
   and that gender differences moderate the effects of social influence
   and self-management of learning on m-learning use intention. These
   findings provide several important implications for m-learning
   acceptance, in terms of both research and practice.

TI Cowboys with cameras: an interactive expedition
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID MEDIA
AB Utilizing the same technologies pioneered by the embedded journalists
   in Iraq, the University of Central Florida (UCF) teamed up with
   TracStar, Inc to create a small-scale, satellite-based expedition
   transmission package to accompany a university film and digital media
   professor into parts of Utah and the Moab Desert that had a historical
   significance to American Western Films. The expedition took the group
   to many locations where scenes from John Wayne and John Ford movies
   were filmed. Students along on the trip camped out and suffered similar
   tough conditions as did the original film crews, experienced the
   wilderness, and participated in lectures and interviews with locals,
   who supported the films and acted as extras and stunt persons. The
   project brought a live experience back to the university campus in
   which students personally interact firsthand with the people, places,
   things in as real a manner as what the remote travelers encountered.
   This article presents details about the experiences of the first
   implementation of the live broadcasts from the remote desert and the
   reactions of focus groups to the experience. One group watched archived
   broadcast, convinced that they were live. Their impressions and
   reactions were recorded and analyzed and compared to those who were
   part of a control group. Conclusions and recommendations for future
   trips are introduced.

TI ICT teacher training: Evidence for multilevel evaluation from a
   national initiative
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper is one of a pair that re-examines the evidence from a
   national initiative to train all teachers in England to bring them up
   to the level of newly qualified teachers, who are required to know when
   to use and when not to use information and communication technologies
   (ICT) in their professional practice. Reanalysis of data gathered for
   the 2004 evaluation uncovers the complexity of such professional
   development. The effectiveness of contrasting approaches to ICT-related
   teacher training was analysed using the national survey of 496 trainees
   and experts' reports on 11 of the 47 training providers. multilevel
   evaluation of professional development was shown to be robust for ICT
   teacher training, including a significant correlation between the views
   of experts and those of teachers. The presence of the middle level of
   'organisational support and change' emerged as a particularly
   discriminating factor, indicating that higher-quality teacher training
   supports change in the classroom and in the school. Therefore, we
   recommend that all five of Guskey's levels be consistently adopted for
   the evaluation of ICT teacher training, and that research should also
   adopt a multilevel model. A second paper delves deeper to describe and
   contrast the highest and lowest-rated approaches to ICT teacher
   training.

TI Motivators and Inhibitors for University Faculty in Distance and
   e-learning
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This article reports on four United States studies of how rewards
   systems, extrinsic and intrinsic, could play an important role in
   providing incentives for university faculty to teach (or remain
   teaching) electronic and distance education courses. The first three
   studies conducted prior to 2003 reported faculty were inherently
   motivated to teach e-learning and distance education. The fourth study
   in 2003 reported key findings that differed from the earlier studies.
   Using a principal components analysis, the researchers found nine
   indicators of motivation to participate or not participate in
   electronic or distance education. The implications from the fourth
   study indicated that, while faculty members were inherently committed
   to helping students, faculty members wanted their basic physiological
   needs met by university administration through extrinsic motivators,
   such as salary increases and course releases.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; CLASSROOM ASSESSMENT; SCIENCE-EDUCATION;
   KNOWLEDGE; PERFORMANCE; REFORM
AB The purpose of this study was to determine pre-service physics
   teachers' attitudes towards assessment. It was also aimed to examine
   the factors affecting their attitudes. Two factors were considered. The
   first was difficulties that pre-service teachers experienced relating
   to assessment. The second factor was teachers' self-efficacy regarding
   their ability to assess. The difficulties were divided into external
   and internal. Internal difficulties depended on pre-service teachers'
   assessment skills and their subject matter knowledge, and represented
   the difficulties that they encountered during preparation and
   evaluation of assessment methods. External difficulties, on the other
   hand, depended on the external factors such as school policy and
   facilities that might affect pre-service teachers' classroom assessment
   implementation. A parallel mixed-methodology approach was utilized
   during the data collection and analysis. This paradigm combined both
   qualitative and quantitative methods to give both breadth and scope to
   the research. The pre-service physics teachers' general attitude
   towards assessment was determined as close to constructivist. Knowledge
   about the subject assessed and university entrance examination were
   found to be the common factors that affected pre-service teachers'
   predispositions for action. Conclusions carry implications for science
   teacher education in Turkey and other countries where educational
   reforms have been implemented.

TI Drawings as Representations of Children's Conceptions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID KNOWLEDGE; EARTH
AB Drawings are often used to obtain an idea of children's conceptions.
   Doing so takes for granted an unambiguous relation between conceptions
   and their representations in drawings. This study was undertaken to
   gain knowledge of the relation between children's conceptions and their
   representation of these conceptions in drawings. A theory of
   contextualization was the basis for finding out how children related
   their contextualization of conceptions in conceptual frameworks to
   their contextualization of drawings in pictorial convention. Eighteen
   children were interviewed in a semi-structured method while they were
   drawing the Earth. Audio-recorded interviews, drawings, and notes were
   analysed to find the cognitive and cultural intentions behind the
   drawings. Also, even children who demonstrated alternative conceptions
   of the Earth in the interviews still followed cultural conventions in
   their drawings. Thus, these alternative conceptions could not be
   deduced from the drawings. The results indicate that children's
   drawings can be used to grasp children's conceptions only by
   considering the meaning the children themselves give to their own
   drawings.

TI Shadows: Young Taiwanese children's views and understanding
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID LIGHT
AB The purpose of this study was to examine young children's views about
   shadows. Young children hear references to or are involved in many
   scientific experiences in their everyday lives, and shadows are a part
   of children's everyday experiences. Young children may have constructed
   their knowledge about shadows through their daily experiences.
   Therefore, a total of 32 children, of which one-half were four years
   old and one-half were five years old, were individually interviewed
   twice to elicit their views and understanding of shadows. Data were
   collected by a mixture of picture-pointing, verbal explanation, and
   manipulation, and were analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively.
   We focused on five facets of children's ideas about shadows: ideas
   about the source of light, shadow orientation, shadow shape, shadow
   size, and shadow intensity. The five year olds performed significantly
   better on production of shadows, production of shadow shape, and
   production of shadow size, and also gave more reasonable explanations
   for their choices than did the four year olds, showing a better
   understanding of the concept of shadows. Another significant finding of
   the study was that young children have a much more sophisticated
   understanding of shadows than Piaget originally suggested and than
   their verbal explanations imply.

TI Identifying a Gender-inclusive Pedagogy from Maltese Teachers' Personal
   Practical Knowledge
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE; PERSPECTIVE; CHOICES; SCHOOL
AB Teachers bring with them into the science classrooms their own gendered
   identitities and their views and perceptions about how boys and girls
   learn and achieve in science. This paper tries to explore the way in
   which 14 Maltese science teachers use their own 'personal practical
   knowledge' to identify their views about gender and science and to
   create their own individual gender-inclusive pedagogy. The study
   suggests that the science teachers focus more on the individuality of
   students and on the social and cultural background of the students in
   their classrooms rather than on gender. The teachers try to develop
   pedagogies and assessment practices that take into consideration the
   personal constructs of individual learners. The ideas for such a
   gender-inclusive pedagogy emerge from their common-sense experience in
   the classroom and their training as teachers, and are closely
   interrelated to current ideas of social constructivism.

   ACQUISITION; CATEGORIES; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK; SCIENTIST; IMAGES
AB The purpose of this study is to explore children's
   typically-perceived-situations (TPS) of 'floating' and 'sinking'. TPS
   refers to the situation rising spontaneously in an individual's mind
   when they first think of a phenomenon or concept. Data were collected
   from 148 Year 5 Korean children. As a result of analysing the data
   according to three categories'spatial background', 'main object', and
   'position of main object'the children mainly thought of a river or a
   sea with a human or a boat on the water surface or half-submerged as a
   floating situation; and a river or sea with a boat or a human on the
   bottom or mid-way between the water surface and the bottom as a sinking
   situation respectively. Considering the whole context of children's
   TPS, the contexts of 'a boat is on the water surface of the sea or
   river' and 'a boat is half-submerged in the sea or river' were the most
   frequent ones, as a floating and as a sinking situation respectively.
   In addition, it appeared that these children's TPS affect their
   judgment of floating and sinking, in that they showed stronger tendency
   to regard the situation where an object is just beneath the water as a
   floating situation, while the position of a main object in their TPS of
   a sinking situation was nearer to the bottom of the water. Based on
   these results, several suggestions for science education are given.

ID MODEL
AB This study investigates staff members' ideas and assumptions about
   visitors' learning at science and technology centres. It also aims to
   explore in what ways their reasoning intersect with existing theories
   about learning within the field of science and technology centre
   research. The results of the study reveal that the staff members allude
   to learning processes differently by distinguishing organized from
   non-organized learning, theoretical learning from practical hands-on
   learning, and serious from non-serious learning. According to most of
   the staff members, these also conclude with different learning
   outcomes. Further, a majority of the staff members state that they do
   not have any scientific knowledge about learning despite the fact that
   they work with the construction of new exhibitions. When discussing
   visitors' learning, the staff members instead refer to personal
   experiences, professional experiences, professional education, and
   external references. When it comes to how they reason about the natural
   scientific content, nearly all express that they use references from
   the natural science community and researchers' knowledge. The article
   moreover discusses in what ways a socio-cultural approach may be used
   in order to understand how learning arises when visitors interact with
   exhibits.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

DT Article
ID APPRENTICESHIP; INQUIRY; PROGRAM; IMPACT
AB This study explored American high school students' perceptions of the
   benefits of a summer astronomy camp, emphasizing a full cycle of the
   research process and how the organization of the camp contributed to
   those perceptions. Semi-structured interviews with students and staff
   were used to elicit the specific benefits that campers perceived from
   their experiences and examine them in relation to the stated goals and
   strategies of camp staff. Among the perceived benefits that students
   described were peer relationships, personal autonomy, positive
   relationships with staff, and deepened science knowledge. These
   perceived benefits appear to influence the kinds of identities students
   constructed for themselves in relation to science. Gee's concept of
   'affinity space' is used to consider how features of the camp's design,
   especially those that promoted student autonomy, contributed to
   students' positive perceptions, and to draw implications for the design
   of informal science learning experiences that can link youth with
   larger communities of scientists.

TI Patterns of Linguistic Communication in Teaching and Learning Science:
   A case study of Korean middle school science classes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate patterns of linguistic
   communication in learning and teaching science and to find out how the
   formation of each pattern was related with the classroom, particularly
   in Korean middle school context. For this, we observed science classes
   in three middle schools in Seoul and collected data during lessons
   through audiotape and videotape recording. From the analysis of the
   data in three cases, nine patterns of spoken or written communication
   in learning and teaching science were found, and the features of each
   pattern and the context were discussed in detail. These results
   provided us with rich information of linguistic communication dealing
   with scientific topics appearing in Korean school science classes. We
   argue that those patterns appear to implicitly reflect the unique
   contexts of science classes in Korea. 'The optimization in teacher
   behaviour', which refers to the conceptualization of teachers' efforts
   to take advantage of the given classroom context, is suggested as one
   of the main causes that made each pattern occur.

AB The aim of this research was to develop a model of factors affecting
   students' ability to interpret external representations (ERs) in
   biochemistry. The study was qualitative in design and was guided by the
   modelling framework of Justi and Gilbert. Application of the process
   outlined by the framework, and consultation with relevant literature,
   led to the expression of a Venn model and to the formulation of
   operational definitions for seven component factors of the model;
   namely, the conceptual (C), reasoning (R), representation mode (M),
   reasoning-mode (R-M), reasoning-conceptual (R-C), conceptual-mode
   (C-M), and conceptual-reasoning-mode (C-R-M) factors. To validate the
   model, nine students were interviewed using a specially designed
   three-phase single interview technique to investigate their
   interpretation of three ERs, representing antibody-antigen interaction.
   The data were analysed by induction, where response patterns emerged
   naturally rather than being predisposed. The results verified the
   validity of the expressed model and its component factors. We suggest
   that the model has a range of potential applications, including as a
   tool for framing researchers' thinking about students' difficulties
   with, and interpretation of, scientific ERs, and for the design of
   strategies to improve learning with ERs.

AB Atomic theory or the nature of matter is a principal concept in science
   and science education. This has, however, been complicated by the
   difficulty students have in learning the concept and the subsequent
   construction of many alternative models. To understand better the
   conceptual barriers to learning atomic structure, this study explores
   the troublesome nature of this fundamental scientific concept. In order
   to illustrate the distinction of student understanding by threshold
   barriers, this study chose three particularly high-achieving students
   from an original interview sample of 20 students who were selected from
   an introductory college chemistry course. The pre-course and
   post-course interview responses were examined and compared in detail.
   This study considers the concepts of 'probability' and 'energy
   quantization' to both describe the structure of the threshold of
   understanding students' need to negotiate in their construction of the
   target model of atomic structure. In this respect, this study suggests
   atomic structure as a possible threshold concept for further study in
   science. Identifying the nature and structure of the threshold of
   understanding confronting students, and analyzing the troublesomeness
   of atomic structure, provides valuable information for understanding
   student learning difficulties, and insight into how they may be
   addressed.

   curricula at junior secondary schools in the Peoples' Republic of China
   in the past 20 years. The history has witnessed two stages of
   developing integrated science curricula during this period in China:
   one was at the provincial level in the 1980s/1990s, while the other was
   at the national level in the new millennium. Using the concept of
   curriculum emphases, this paper purported to investigate the advocated
   forms of integration and the reasons and causes behind them in
   integrated science curriculum during the period under study. Data were
   collected from two sources: curriculum documents related to the
   integrated science curricula, and interviews with key informants who
   were involved in designing the official documents of this kind of
   science curriculum. Two models of integration have been identified from
   the two stages respectively: one is 'integration within science
   subjects', while the other 'integration beyond science subjects'. The
   social-political roots of the two models of integration have been
   traced. To meet the goal of scientific literacy, it is suggested in the
   final part of this paper that the model of 'integration within science
   subjects' should be abandoned while the model of 'integration beyond
   science subjects' should be advocated in the process of developing
   integrated science curriculum.

AB This study is a part of a larger study that examined using
   socioscientific issues (SSI) as a form of effective science teaching.
   The purpose was to investigate how teaching a year-long curriculum
   using SSI affects science learning outcomes. In this report, we examine
   the effects of a SSI-driven curriculum on the development of students'
   moral sensitivity. Our results indicate that development of moral
   sensitivity can be promoted through science learning experiences
   embedded in SSI. Results also suggest that moral sensitivity is
   contextually dependent. Implications for teaching are discussed.

AB We hypothesized that instruction in the criteria of scientific
   arguments, in combination with constructivist epistemic beliefs, would
   produce greater learning about physics concepts. The study was a
   randomized experiment, where college undergraduates (n = 88) discussed,
   in pairs over the Web, several physics problems related to gravity and
   air resistance. Prior to their discussions, one-half of the dyads
   received information on the nature of scientific arguments. All
   students were classified epistemologically as relativists, multiplists,
   or evaluativists. We found that students in the treatment group
   incorporated more scientific criteria into their discussion notes and
   accordingly developed better arguments on several dimensions. In
   addition, significantly more participants in the treatment group
   adopted the correct answer to one of the problems. Outcomes also
   differed in relation to students' epistemic beliefs. Specifically,
   multiplists were less critical of inconsistencies and misconceptions,
   and interacted with their partners less than other belief groups,
   whereas evaluativists interacted more critically, bringing up different
   ideas from their partners. Evaluativists also solved one of the physics
   problems more accurately and tended to demonstrate a reduction in
   misconceptions. We discuss the results in light of instruction in
   scientific argumentation, conceptual development and change, and
   epistemic beliefs.

AB The main purpose of this study was to examine the structural
   relationships between scientific epistemological views (SEVs) and
   information commitments (ICs) of high school students in Taiwan. Data
   were collected from 486 Taiwanese high school students via two
   self-reporting instruments: one was the SEV questionnaire, including
   five scales for representing students' views toward scientific
   knowledge; and the other was the ICs survey, involving six scales for
   exploring their evaluative standards and searching strategies of online
   science information. Structural equation modelling analysis was used to
   examine the relationships between the aspects of SEVs and ICs. The
   results of the measurement model confirmed that both the SEVs and ICs
   instruments had highly satisfactory validity and reliability. The
   structural equation modelling analysis further indicated that students'
   SEVs guided their evaluative standards and searching strategy when
   dealing with Web-based science information. For example, students who
   viewed scientific knowledge as more changeable and tentative
   significantly tended to adopt a more sophisticated evaluative standard,
   such as carefully inspecting the content of web sites for judging the
   usefulness. The findings in general suggested that students with more
   constructivist-oriented SEVs might develop more advanced standards and
   searching strategy toward online scientific information to derive great
   benefit from Web-based environments. Consequently, the role of SEVs
   should be highlighted as increasingly metacognitive engagement with
   online science information.

AB Student Response Technology (SRT) involves the use of hand-held remotes
   by students during classroom lectures to electronically respond to
   questions. This study surveyed 350 students enrolled in one of 13
   lower-division university science classes taught by five different
   instructors who used SRT. The survey probed students' perceptions of
   SRT in terms of enhancing student learning, and investigated which
   features of SRT students felt had the greatest/least impact on student
   learning. The majority of students reported that the SRT increased
   their content understanding, class participation, alertness, and
   interactions with fellow students, helped with examination preparation,
   provided important and immediate instructor feedback, and made class
   more enjoyable. Students in this study scored more positively than peer
   groups on survey questions related to student engagement in academic
   and intellectual experiences, suggesting that SRT helps to promote
   student engagement. Important instructor actions identified during this
   study that augment the enhancing effects of SRT on student learning,
   even in large lecture settings, include designing clear, substantive
   questions, reviewing correct and incorrect answers with students, and
   making pedagogical adjustments based on class responses.

AB Recent calls for border crossing between reading and science have
   heightened the need to support science teachers in integrating reading
   into science and to verify the robustness of this approach in the
   context of inquiry-based science. In this paper, we share what we did,
   found, and learned in a collaborative project in which a team of
   university-based reading educators and school-based science teachers
   worked together to infuse reading strategy instruction and quality
   science trade books into inquiry-based sixth-grade science classrooms.
   We suggest that infusing reading into middle school science enhances
   science teaching and learning, but is a complex, multifaceted
   undertaking.

AB Electronic Blocks are a new programming environment designed
   specifically for children aged between 3 and 8 years. These physical,
   stackable blocks include sensor blocks, action blocks, and logic
   blocks. By connecting these blocks, children can program a wide variety
   of structures that interact with one another and the environment.
   Electronic Blocks provide young children with opportunities to program
   and observe dynamic behavior without having to acquire complex symbolic
   notation systems. Young children are able to build and debug program
   structures by using Electronic Blocks because the syntactic and
   semantic problems that confront users of conventional programming
   languages have been reduced.

TI "I Went by Twos, He Went by One": Multiple Interpretations of

SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES

DT Article
ID GRAPHS; COMPREHENSION; CLASSROOM; LANGUAGE; TALKING; TASKS
AB This article examines a classroom discussion of multiple
   interpretations of the scales on two distance versus time graphs. The
   analysis describes how two students and a teacher used multiple
   meanings for phrases of the form "I went by" and coordinated these
   meanings with different views of the scales. Students' ambiguous and
   shifting meanings did not prove to be obstacles to this discussion.
   Instead, this teacher used student interpretations as resources, built
   on them, and connected them to canonical mathematical concepts-in
   particular by highlighting (Goodwin, 1994) a "unitized" (Lamon, 1994,
   1996, 2007) view of the scales. Research in mathematics education
   describes teaching that promotes conceptual development as having two
   central features: One is that teachers and students attend explicitly
   to concepts, and the other is that students wrestle with important
   mathematics (Hiebert & Grouws, 2007). Not only does this classroom
   discussion provide an example that it is possible to balance these two
   features, but the analysis provides the details of how instruction can
   simultaneously provide explicit attention to concepts while allowing
   students to wrestle with these concepts.

AB The purpose of this qualitative exploratory study was to identify
   factors that influenced prospective and experienced secondary level
   science teachers' reasoning as they evaluated or selected tasks to
   formatively assess their students' understanding of scientific
   concepts. The analysis of the coded written responses revealed two
   categories of factors that influenced the teachers' reasoning: (I)
   characteristics of the task and (2) characteristics of students or the
   curriculum. Characteristics of the task related to qualities of the
   task regardless of the learning environment in which it Would be used,
   Such as the level of student thinking demanded by a task.
   Characteristics of the students and the curriculum related to the
   learning environment in which an assessment task would be implemented,
   Such as students' abilities to complete the task. Both prospective and
   experienced teachers' task evaluations were influenced by the same
   factors related to the characteristics of the task, although their
   interpretations of the meaning of each factor varied. In addition,
   experienced teachers' task evaluations were more likely than
   prospective teachers to be influenced by factors related to
   characteristics of students and the curriculum. The findings are
   discussed as a conceptual framework thin presents the identified
   factors along three different dimensions: (I) the influence of task,
   student, and curriculum characteristics, (2) the influence of
   expectations for success, and (3) the influence of teaching experience.

AB Growing recognition of the central importance of fostering an in-depth
   understanding of natural selection has, Surprisingly, failed to
   stimulate work on the development and rigorous evaluation of
   instruments that measure knowledge of it. We used three different
   methodological tools, the Conceptual Inventory of Natural Selection
   (CINS), a modified version of Bishop and Anderson's (Bishop and
   Anderson [ 1990] Journal of Research in Science Teaching 27: 415-427)
   open-response test that we call the Open Response Instrument (ORI), and
   an oral interview derived from both instruments, to measure biology
   majors' understanding of and alternative conceptions about natural
   selection. We explored how these instruments differentially inform
   science educators about the knowledge and alternative conceptions their
   students harbor. Overall, both the CINS and ORI provided excellent
   replacements for the time-consuming process of oral interviews and
   produced comparable measures of key concept diversity and, to a lesser
   extent, key concept frequency. In contrast, the ORI and CINS produced
   significantly different measures of both alternative conception
   diversity and frequency, with the ORI results completely concordant
   with oral interview results. Our study indicated that revisions, of
   both the CINS and ORI are necessary because of numerous instrument
   items characterized by low discriminability, high and/or overlapping
   difficulty, and mismatches with the sample. While Our results revealed
   that both instruments are valid and generally reliable measures of
   knowledge and alternative conceptions about natural selection, a test
   combining particular components of both instruments-a modified version
   of the CINS to test for key concepts, and a modified version of the ORI
   to assess student alternative conceptions-should be used until a more
   approprite instrument is developed and rigorously evaluated. (C) 2008

AB This study examined how photographs in six introductory environmental
   science texts portrayed the urban environments in which most U.S.
   Students lived. All photographs from all texts were coded to determine
   whether they depicted urban areas. The urban photographs were then
   coded to determine what they communicated about the urban environment.
   The analysis suggested that the texts in this study, though varied in
   their portrayal of urban ecosystems, did address many of the
   environmental issues that affected the city. However, urban examples
   were rarely used to illustrate general ecological concepts that applied
   to all ecosystems (i.e., biodiversity or evolution). The author
   contended that "sense of place" theories indicated that more
   photographs should be dedicated to portraying urban environments as
   functioning ecosystems. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci

AB This study aimed to investigate the comparative Value of experimenting
   with physical manipulatives (PM) in a sequential combination with
   virtual inanipulatives (VM), with the use of PM preceding the use of
   VM, and of experimenting with PM alone, with respect to changes in
   students' conceptual understanding in the domain of heat and
   temperature. A pre-post-comparison Study design was used which involved
   62 undergraduate students that attended an introductory course in
   physics. The participants were randomly assigned to one experimental
   and one control group. Both groups used the same inquiry-oriented
   curriculum materials. Participants in the control group used PM to
   conduct the experiments. whereas, participants in the experimental
   group used first PM and then VM. VM differed from PM in that it could
   provide the possibility of faster manipulation, whereas, it retained
   any other features and interactions of the study's subject domain
   identical to the PM condition. Conceptual tests were administered to
   assess students' understanding before, during, and after the Study's
   treatments. Results indicated that experimenting with the combination
   of PM and VM enhanced students' conceptual understanding more than
   experimenting with PM alone. The use of VM was identified as the cause
   of this differentiation. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci

   beliefs. These results are compared to those from Zeldin and Pajares'
   earlier study involving women in STEM careers. For women. social
   persuasions and vicarious experiences were the primary sources of
   sell-efficacy beliefs. Together. these findings suggest that different
   sources are predominant in the creation and development of the
   self-efficacy beliefs of men and women who pursue STEM careers. The
   self-efficacy beliefs of men in these male-dominated domains are
   Created primarily as a result of the interpretations they make of their

AB This Study investigated the representations of a select group of
   scientists (n = 10) in a sample of Canadian high school and college
   textbooks. Drawing on semoitic and cultural-historical activity
   theoretical frameworks, we conducted two analyses. A coarse-grained,
   quantitative analysis of the prevalence and structure of these
   representations exhibited bias toward particular scientists'
   representations and particular types of texts and inscriptions therein,
   suggesting a domain-specific rhetorical structure. A fine-grained,
   qualitative analysis of scientists' representations revealed that high
   school and college textbooks represent: (a) objects of scientific
   practice as projected or anticipated independently from human activity;
   (b) scientists' individual actions aiming at the creation of
   non-tangible tools and rules by means of observation, modification, or
   manipulation of given, tangible objects; (c) scientific practice as
   isolated due to which the simultaneous belonging to different practices
   hardly determines the goals of scientists' actions; and (d) scientists
   as part of a small community of mainly other scientists who
   subsequently determine each other's individual actions. The
   implications of these outcomes were discussed. (C) 2008 Wiley

AB Translating written curricular materials into rich, complex, learning
   environments is an undertheorized area in science education. This study
   examines two critical cases of teachers enacting a technology-rich
   curriculum focused on the development of complex reasoning around
   biodiversity for fifth graders. Two elements emerged that significantly
   impact teacher enactment-their conceptions of authenticity (authentic
   learning/authentic science) and their view of science
   (descriptive/inferential). The results suggest that disentangling the
   common conflation of these two elements supports a broader definition
   of inquiry science teaching that is more sensitive to context and
   individual teacher enactment. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed

AB Classrooms across the United States increasingly find White teachers
   paired with ethnic minority students, but few of these teachers are
   prepared for the disparities such cultural integration presents. This
   is particularly true vis-a-vis science education. While classrooms have
   diversified, science instruction has not necessarily followed suit. Two
   theories, constructivism and culturally relevant pedagogy, have been
   identified as mechanisms to diminish the disparities in science
   education. Yet culturally relevant pedagogy has not had the same impact
   as constructivism, even though it has been posited as a crucial means
   to better assure ethnic minority access to education. A case study of
   two classroom teachers investigates whether and how constructivism can
   be leveraged to develop culturally relevant pedagogy in science
   instruction. Identifying practical possibilities for culturally
   relevant pedagogy in science education is important for students,
   teachers, and the future of the U.S. workforce because it provides a
   means of increasing marginalized students' access to science and
   technological fields. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed

ID SCIENCE-EDUCATION; DISCURSIVE IDENTITY; PERSPECTIVES; SENSE
AB This research presents a case study of two teachers' emphasis on
   students' academic identity as a means of facilitating their science
   literacy development. These cases support a theoretical position that
   deconstructs the notion of normative science literacy into its
   constitutive components: (a) being scientific and (b) appropriating its
   literate practices. Such a perspective views language as a substantive
   resource for academic identity construction. As such, we utilize a
   theoretical metaphor of "contextual shifting" to underscore teachers'
   central role in facilitating student understanding of literate
   practices associated with school science. Through a cross-ease analysis
   of two elementary science classrooms, we identified ways that students'
   academic identities were connected to their affiliation with specific
   scientific literate practices. Our findings reveal that the teachers in
   both research classrooms utilized teaching practices designed to afford
   students opportunities to develop academic identities commensurate with
   science learning. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 92:1015-1041,

AB We teach earth, ecological, and environmental sciences in and about
   places imbued with meaning by human experience. Scientific
   understanding is but one of the many types of meanings that can accrue
   to a given place. People develop emotional attachments to meaningful
   places. The sense of place, encompassing the meanings and attachments
   that places hold for people, has been well characterized in
   environmental psychology. Its components, place attachment and place
   meaning, can be measured psychometrically. Place-based science teaching
   focuses on local and regional environments and synthesizes different
   ways of knowing them, leveraging the senses of place of students and
   teachers. Place-based teaching has been advocated for its relevance and
   potential to attract underrepresented groups to science. We posit that
   sense of place is a measurable learning outcome of place-based science
   teaching. We developed an Arizona-based, culturally inclusive,
   meaning-rich introductory geology course, and used published surveys to
   assess place attachment and meaning in students who took the course. We
   observed significant gains in student place attachment and place
   meaning, indicating that these instruments are generalizable and
   sensitive enough for use in this context. Sense of place should be
   engaged by teachers of place-based science, and further explored as an
   assessment measure. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed

AB Although there have been numerous studies that indicate the benefits of
   teachers and students working with scientists, there is little research
   that documents scientists' views of science education, science teacher
   preparation, and the goals of science education. Furthermore, little is
   known about how scientists' views of science education may differ from
   those held by science teachers. Through the use of semistructured
   interviews, the perceptions of 37 scientists from diverse science
   domains and 21 middle and high school science teachers were explored.
   Participating scientists expressed concerns about the variability in
   quality of teaching, programs, and resources available for science
   instruction. Scientists expressed a desire for teachers to have more
   experience conducting science research and developing their own
   critical thinking skills. When asked what goals are most important for
   science education, 40% of the scientists emphasized that teachers
   should make science fun and exciting for their students. Science
   teachers' perceptions of science education were compared with the
   scientists' perceptions. Thirty percent of the teachers agreed with the
   scientists that too much variability in program or instructional
   quality exists in science education. Seventy-six percent of the science
   teachers also thought there is a need to teach critical thinking
   skills, but more importantly there is a need to inspire creativity and
   a desire to learn science in students. Both teachers and scientists
   expressed concerns about how high-stakes accountability inhibits
   efforts to improve science education. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The Simpson-Troost Attitude Questionnaire (STAQ) was developed as part
   of a study to assess adolescent commitment to and achievement in
   science. For this psychometric reappraisal of the 57-item STAQ, data
   were analyzed from a convenience sample of 1,754 secondary students.
   Confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses were applied, and results
   suggested that the STAQ can be shortened from 57 to 22 items spanning
   five revised dimensions. These five dimensions were arranged into an
   exploratory structural equation model, which showed some grade and
   gender differences and strong associations among classroom environment,
   self-directed effort, and science affect. Findings raise the potential
   for teacher professional development to improve science classroom
   activities, and influence student self-directed effort and science
   affect. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 92:1076-1095, 2008

AB In evaluating the success of teacher development programs, valid and
   scalable measures of teaching practice are needed. We have developed
   and validated the Science Lesson Plan Analysis Instrument (SLPAI) for
   quantitative evaluation of teacher-generated multiday lesson plans.
   This paper presents the SLPAI as a complement to surveys and classroom
   observation, and demonstrates its use in 2 pilot studies. The SLPAI was

   cohorts and tailor program instruction. It was also used to track
   changes in teaching practice and pedagogical knowledge of participants
   over time, providing summative evidence of program effectiveness. (C)

TI Positionality of African Americans and a Theoretical Accommodation of
   It: Rethinking Science Education Research
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID RACE; TEACHERS
AB This essay addresses a call for research involving African Americans to
   interpret data from the historical, contemporary, and cultural
   experiences of African Americans. The essay argues for a science
   education research approach that explicitly considers the positionality
   of African Americans in the United States. This positionality involves
   the negotiation of three distinct and conflicting realms of experience
   that pertain to oppression, African-rooted Black culture, and the
   dominant culture in the United States. The theoretical tool proposed in
   this essay accommodates the positionality of African Americans by
   superimposing it upon a model that synthesizes the ideas of Michael
   Cole (cultural-historical activity theory) and Urie Bronfenbrenner
   (ecology of human development). (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed

TI An examination of the impact of learning objects in secondary school
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING
LA English
DT Article

ID INSTRUCTION; SIMULATION
AB Very few studies have systematically evaluated the effect of learning
   objects in secondary school classrooms. The vast majority of studies
   have focussed on higher education. The current study examined the
   impact of learning objects from the perspective of 850 students and 27
   teachers (50 classrooms) of science, mathematics, or social science.
   The results suggest that teachers typically spend 1 to 2 h finding and
   preparing for learning object based lesson plans that focus on the
   review of previous concepts. Both teachers and students are positive
   about the learning benefits, quality, and engagement value of learning
   objects, although teachers are more positive than students. Student
   performance increased significantly - almost 30% - when learning
   objects were used in conjunction with a variety of teaching strategies.
   It is reasonable to conclude that learning objects are a viable
   teaching tool in a secondary school environment.

AB Cross-age tutors were randomly assigned to one of the three tutor
   training conditions distinguished for the current study: (1) the
   labelling experimental condition, characterized by requirements to
   label their tutor interventions, based on the e-moderating model of
   Salmon; (2) the non-labelling experimental condition, focusing on
   tutor's acting upon the role of an e-moderator without preliminary
   requirements with regard to labelling the phase of e-moderating in
   their messages; and (3) a control condition, typified by all-round
   information on online facilitation. The results indicated that tutors
   are not really capable in labelling their interventions accurately.
   Nevertheless, labelling did foster enhanced e-moderating activities.
   Compared to tutors in the control condition, tutors in the experimental
   conditions performed at a higher level, implying that they adopted more
   balanced tutor support. Labelling did not result in a differential
   impact on self-efficacy and perceived collective efficacy.

AB The present study investigates the effects of multimedia and schema
   induced analogical reasoning on science learning. It involves 89 fourth
   grade elementary students in the north-east of the United States.
   Participants are randomly assigned into four conditions: (a) multimedia
   with analogy; (b) multimedia without analogy; (c) analogy without
   multimedia; and (d) non-multimedia and non-analogy. The multivariate
   analyses of covariance reveal significant main effects for multimedia
   and analogy learning as well as a significant interaction between
   multimedia and analogy. The findings show that schema induced
   analogical reasoning can significantly improve science learning and
   that multimedia becomes more effective when it is integrated with an
   instructional method such as analogy and less so when it is used only
   as a visual tool. The study also shows the field
   dependence/independence as a significant covariate that influences
   learners' schema induced analogical reasoning in learning. Discussions
   pertaining to the significance of the findings and their implications
   for teaching and learning are made. Suggestions for future research are
   included with an emphasis on developing multimedia supported analogical
   reasoning for science learning.

AB Tutors have only limited time to support students. In this paper, we
   discuss a model that addresses the question of how to help students
   answer content-related questions. A small group of students is created,
   which consists of the student who asked the question and peers who
   should be able to answer it. Criteria used to compose the group are the
   content of the question in relation to the knowledge and skills of the
   peers. The model supports the collaboration with text fragments
   selected from the study materials. We will introduce the model and
   briefly discuss the results of the calibration and a simulation of the
   model. Finally, we will discuss the outcome of an experiment with two
   groups of approximately 50 students who used the model for a period of
   8 weeks. The results indicate that the students positively value the
   model and that it is possible to resolve a substantial number of their
   questions.

AB The central aim of this study was to test a model that integrates
   determinants of educational computer use. In particular, the article
   examines teacher and school characteristics that are associated with
   different types of computer use by primary school teachers. A survey
   was set up, involving 527 teachers from 68 primary schools in Flanders.
   A separate questionnaire was administered to information and
   communication technology (ICT) coordinators from the same schools to
   gather additional information about cultural and contextual school
   characteristics. The combined impact of both teacher and school
   characteristics was explored through a multilevel analysis. Besides the
   importance of school characteristics, the results reveal differential
   effects of specific characteristics on specific types of computer use.
   Cultural school characteristics for instance, such as the schools'
   openness to change and the availability of an ICT school policy plan,
   are positively related to the use of computers as a learning tool and
   to the adoption of ICT in view of basic computer skills. In contrast,
   no cultural school characteristic seem to be associated with the use of
   computers as an information tool. In a comparable way, teacher
   characteristics are associated with specific types of computer use,
   e.g. the variable gender. In general, male teachers report integrating
   computers more often. In this study, it appears that gender differences
   only exist in relation to the adoption of computers as an information
   tool. The results demonstrate that a multidimensional approach provides
   more insight into the characteristics affecting computer use.

AB The study was conducted to investigate the relation of adolescent
   students' mathematics motivation and achievement to their appropriate
   help-seeking and inappropriate guessing behaviour while using
   instructional software. High school students (n = 90) completed brief
   assessments of mathematics motivation and then worked with software for
   geometry instruction. Students' actions with the software were
   machine-classified to identify instances of appropriate help-seeking
   and inappropriate guessing. Mathematics teachers provided information
   about students' achievement (high, average or at risk of failing math
   class). Results indicated that students with low math self-concept were
   most likely to engage in inappropriate guessing behaviour. Students
   with low math achievement were most likely to engage in appropriate
   help-seeking while working with the software.

ID EDUCATION
AB Whereas the penetration of mobile phones in Asian countries keeps
   climbing, little research has explored the application of the short
   message service (SMS) in second language learning. This study aims to
   examine the effectiveness of SMS vocabulary lessons of limited lexical
   information on the small screens of mobile phones. Thirty high school
   students were randomly distributed into two groups and given two sets
   of English words either on paper or through SMS messages during two
   weeks. Students recognized more vocabulary during the post-test after
   reading the regular and brief SMS lessons than they did after reading
   the relatively more detailed print material. Qualitative data from
   interviews offer information about the learning process as well as the
   benefits and limitations of m-learning. Results of the questionnaires
   show that students in general hold positive attitudes towards learning
   vocabulary via mobile phone. On the other hand, technological
   limitations, unfamiliar presentations and learning activities may
   prevent students from reading SMS lessons.

AB As class sizes increase, methods of assessments shift from costly
   traditional approaches (e.g. expert-graded writing assignments) to more
   economic and logistically feasible methods (e.g. multiple-choice
   testing, computer-automated scoring, or peer assessment). While each
   method of assessment has its merits, it is peer assessment in
   particular, especially when made available online through a Web-based
   interface (e.g. our peerScholar system), that has the potential to
   allow a reintegration of open-ended writing assignments in any size
   class - and in a manner that is pedagogically superior to traditional
   approaches. Many benefits are associated with peer assessment, but it
   was the concerns that prompted two experimental studies (n = 120 in
   each) using peerScholar to examine mark agreement between and within
   groups of expert (graduate teaching assistants) and peer (undergraduate
   students) markers. Overall, using peerScholar accomplished the goal of
   returning writing into a large class, while producing grades similar in
   level and rank order as those provided by expert graders, especially
   when a grade accountability feature was used.

TI Development of an Instrument Designed to Investigate Elements of

   The SEMLI-S
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The development and evaluation of science students' metacognition,
   learning processes and self-efficacy are important for improving
   science education. This paper reports on the development of an
   empirical self- report instrument for providing a measure of students'
   metacognition, self-efficacy and constructivist science learning
   processes. A review of the range of literature related to
   metacognition, self- regulation and constructivist learning processes
   resulted in the development of an initial bilingual ( English and
   traditional Chinese) instrument composed of 72 items. This instrument
   was completed by 465 Hong Kong high school students. The data collected
   were subjected to exploratory factor analysis and Rasch analysis. The
   subsequent refinement process resulted in a final version of the
   Self-Efficacy and Metacognition Learning Inventory-Science (SEMLI-S)
   consisting of 30 items that can be used for either analysing and
   focusing on any or all of its dimensions or for assigning scores to
   individuals that enable comparison between them in relation to their
   metacognitive science learning orientations.

AB In this paper, we examine how students discuss and interpret data and
   whether these actions vary depending on the type of data they analyse.
   More specifically, we are interested in whether students perform
   differently when analysing first-hand data, which they collect
   themselves, compared with second-hand data provided to them. Our data
   analysis focused on two classrooms using two different curriculum
   units, chemistry in Grade 7 and biology in Grade 8, collected during
   the 2002/03 school year from a Mid-western urban middle school in the
   USA. We analysed classroom videotape associated with lessons in which
   students discussed first-hand and second-hand data both in small group
   settings and full class discussions. We found the two types of data
   offer different benefits and limitations, suggesting that both types of
   data are important for students to work with as they develop skills in
   scientific inquiry practices. We discuss the characteristics of
   classroom discussions around different data sources as well as
   implications for the design of curriculum materials, instructional
   environments, and student learning in science.

TI Lakatos' Scientific Research Programmes as a Framework for Analysing
   Informal Argumentation about Socio-scientific Issues
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

ID DECISION-MAKING; STUDENTS ARGUMENTATION; SOCIOSCIENTIFIC ISSUES;
   SCIENCE-EDUCATION; KNOWLEDGE; DISCOURSE; DILEMMAS
AB The purpose of this study is to explore how Lakatos' scientific
   research programmes might serve as a theoretical framework for
   representing and evaluating informal argumentation about
   socio-scientific issues. Seventy undergraduate science and non-science
   majors were asked to make written arguments about four socio-scientific
   issues. Our analysis showed that the science majors' informal arguments
   were significantly better than the non-science majors' arguments. In
   terms of the resources for supporting reasons, we find that personal
   experience and scientific belief are the two categories that are
   generated most often in both groups of the participants. Besides,
   science majors made significantly greater use of analogies, while
   non-science majors made significantly greater use of authority. In
   addition, both science majors and non-science majors had a harder time
   changing their arguments after participating in a group discussion. In
   the study of argumentation in science, scholars have often used
   Toulmin's framework of data, warrant, backing, qualifiers, claims, and
   rebuttal. Our work demonstrates that Lakatos' work is also a viable
   perspective, especially when warrant and backing are difficult to
   discern, and when students' arguments are resistant to change. Our use
   of Lakatos' framework highlights how the 'hard core' of students'
   arguments about socio-scientific issues does, indeed, seem to be
   protected by a 'protective belt' and, thus, is difficult to alter. From
   these insights, we make specific implications for further research and
   teaching.

TI Students' Meaning-making of Socio-scientific Issues in Computer
   Mediated Settings: Exploring learning through interaction trajectories
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCHOOL SCIENCE; ARGUMENTATION; CLASSROOM; GENETICS; PUPILS; TALK
AB This article reports on a study concerning secondary school students'
   meaning-making of socio-scientific issues in Information and
   Communication Technology-mediated settings. Our theoretical argument
   has as its point of departure the analytical distinction between 'doing
   science' and 'doing school,' as two different forms of classroom
   activity. In the study we conducted an analysis of students working
   with web-based groupware systems concerned with genetics. The analysis
   identified how the students oriented their accounts of scientific
   concepts and how they attempted to understand the socio-scientific task
   in different ways. Their orientations were directed towards finding
   scientific explanations, towards exploring the ethical and social
   consequences, and towards 'fact-finding.' The students' different
   orientations seemed to contribute to an ambivalent tension, which, on
   the one hand, was productive because it urged them into ongoing
   discussions and explicit meaning-making. On the other hand, however,
   the tension elucidated how complex and challenging collaborative
   learning situations can be. Our findings suggest that in order to
   obtain a deeper understanding of students' meaning-making of
   socio-scientific issues in Information and Communication
   Technology-mediated settings, it is important not only to address how
   students perform the activity of 'doing science.' It is equally
   important to be sensitive with respect to how students orient their
   talk and activity towards more or less explicit values, demands, and
   expectations embedded in the educational setting. In other words, how
   students perform the activity of 'doing school.'

TI Promoting Pre-experimental Activities in High-school Chemistry:
   Focusing on the role of students' epistemic questions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE-EDUCATION
AB In high-school chemistry the pre-experimental phase of inquiry cycles
   often remains neglected. According to a procedural model, which is
   described in the text, this phase begins with an observation that
   stimulates students' prior factual knowledge, the formulation of a
   research question for further elaboration (epistemic questions), the
   anticipation of a hypothetical answer, and the planning of experimental
   steps for deciding on the hypothetical answer. These activities were
   explicitly prescribed in an experimental group of 28 10th-graders.
   Raising the quality of students' epistemic research questions by
   providing structured help was a special focus of the intervention.
   Hypothesised motivational and cognitive effects were measured and
   compared with a group of 25 students (control group) who engaged in
   non-structured pre-experimental activities. The intervention provided
   to the experimental group resulted in stronger preferences for a more
   open and non-recipe type of experimentation, in more intense cognitive
   activities (thoughts), and, most importantly, in increased skills for
   formulating causal epistemic questions. Supporting such procedural
   skills in classrooms may contribute to transforming labwork into
   intentional activities and students into active learners by helping
   them focus on further elaborating their knowledge.

TI Examining the Alignment of Chinese National Physics Curriculum
   Guidelines and 12th-grade Exit Examinations: A case study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This study reports findings from an analysis of the 2002 Chinese
   National Physics Curriculum Guidelines and the alignment between the
   curriculum guidelines and two most recent provincial-level 12th-grade
   exit examinations in China. Both curriculum guidelines and test content
   were represented using two-dimensional matrices (i.e., topic by level
   of cognitive demands) and the Porter's alignment indices were reported.
   It appeared that the curriculum documents and the standardized
   examinations mostly emphasized student understanding of fundamental
   principles and concepts of physics. Moreover, the two examinations
   consistently over-represented the curriculum at both application and
   analysis cognitive levels. The study also indicated that neither the
   organization of the current curriculum guidelines nor the exit
   assessments encourage creativity, critical thinking, and the
   development of students' abilities to conduct scientific inquiry. The
   findings of this study can be used for comparative studies of different
   countries' science curriculum standards and assessment systems, and can
   provide insights into the improvement of science education from an
   international perspective.

TI Teaching a Biotechnology Curriculum Based on Adapted Primary Literature
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

DT Article
ID BIOLOGY CURRICULUM; AUTHENTIC INQUIRY; SCIENCE TEACHERS; STUDENTS;
   SCHOOLS; CONTEXT
AB Adapted primary literature (APL) refers to an educational genre
   specifically designed to enable the use of research articles for
   learning biology in high school. The present investigation focuses on
   the paedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of four high-school biology
   teachers who enacted an APL-based curriculum in biotechnology. Using a
   constructivist qualitative research approach, we analysed those
   teachers' aims and beliefs, the instructional strategies they used
   during the enactment of the curriculum, as well as the outcomes of the
   enactment as perceived by the teachers and their students, and as
   reflected in the class observations. Some of the teachers' strategies
   applied during the enactment, such as the conversational model, were
   specifically designed for teaching APL-based curricula. We found that
   the instructional strategies applied for the adapted articles were
   associated with cognitive and affective engagement, active learning,
   inquiry thinking, and understanding of the nature of science. Suitable
   teacher PCK promoted learning by inquiry in addition to learning on
   inquiry. Students' challenges were mainly linked to the comprehension
   of complex, multi-stage, biotechnological processes and methods that
   are abundant throughout the curriculum and required the use of previous
   knowledge in new contexts. A complex interaction of factors, namely
   teachers' PCK, the APL genre, and the biotechnology content of the
   curriculum, shaped the instructional strategies of the new curriculum
   and the outcomes of its enactment

AB In science education, students should come to understand the nature and
   significance of models. In the case of chemistry education it is argued
   that the present use of models is often not meaningful from the
   students' perspective. A strategy to overcome this problem is to use an
   authentic chemical modelling practice as a context for a curriculum
   unit. The theoretical framework for this strategy is activity theory
   rooted in socio-cultural theories on learning. An authentic chemical
   modelling practice is characterized by a set of motives for model
   development through a well-defined modelling procedure using only
   relevant issue knowledge. The aim of this study was to explore,
   analyse, and select authentic chemical modelling practices for use in
   chemistry education. The suitability of the practices was reviewed by
   applying a stepwise procedure focused on criteria such as students'
   interest and ownership, modelling procedure, issue knowledge, and
   feasibility of the laboratory work in the classroom. It was concluded
   that modelling drinking-water treatment and human exposure assessment
   are both suitable to serve as contexts, because both practices exhibit
   clear motives for model construction and the applied modelling
   procedures are in line with students' pre-existing procedural modelling
   knowledge. The issue knowledge involved is consistent with present
   Dutch science curriculum, and it is possible to carry out experimental
   work in the classroom for model calibration and validation. The method
   described here to select and evaluate practices for use as contexts in
   chemistry education can also be used in other science domains.

   (HLCTP) were very active as they asked a significantly greater number
   of questions compared to teachers facilitating classrooms with low
   levels of constructivists teaching practices (LLCTP). In addition,
   teachers facilitating with HLCTP used a significantly greater number of
   open-ended questions when compared with other types of questions
   (closed-ended questions and task-oriented questions). Closed-ended
   questions were found in the HLCTP classrooms as teachers were concerned
   with focusing students on completing investigations, but open-ended
   questions were more often found with the aim of promoting student
   actions attuned to knowledge construction.

TI Exploring Conceptual Integration in Student Thinking: Evidence from a
   case study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CHEMISTRY; SCIENCE; MOLECULES; EDUCATION; COGNITION; PHYSICS; MODELS;
   ATOMS
AB Two reasons are suggested for studying the degree of conceptual
   integration in student thinking. The linking of new material to
   existing knowledge is an important aspect of meaningful learning. It is
   also argued that conceptual coherence is a characteristic of scientific
   knowledge and a criterion used in evaluating new theories. Appreciating
   this 'scientific value' should be one objective when students learn
   about the nature of science. These considerations imply that students
   should not only learn individual scientific models and principles, but
   should be taught to see how they are linked together. The present paper
   describes the use of an interview protocol designed to explore
   conceptual integration across two college-level subjects (chemistry and
   physics). The novelty here is that a single interview is used to elicit
   explanations of a wide range of phenomena. The potential of this
   approach is demonstrated through an account of one student's scientific
   thinking, showing both how she applied fundamental ideas widely, and
   also where conceptual integration was lacking. The value and
   limitations of using this type of interview as one means for
   researching conceptual integration in students' thinking are discussed.

TI Does Practical Work Really Work? A study of the effectiveness of
   practical work as a teaching and learning method in school science
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Many within the science education community and beyond see practical
   work carried out by students as an essential feature of science
   education. Questions have, however, been raised by some science
   educators about its effectiveness as a teaching and learning strategy.
   This study explored the effectiveness of practical work by analysing a
   sample of 25 'typical' science lessons involving practical work in
   English secondary schools. Data took the form of observational field
   notes and tape-recorded interviews with teachers and students. The
   analysis used a model of effectiveness based on the work of Millar et
   al. and Tiberghien. The teachers' focus in these lessons was
   predominantly on developing students' substantive scientific knowledge,
   rather than on developing understanding of scientific enquiry
   procedures. Practical work was generally effective in getting students
   to do what is intended with physical objects, but much less effective
   in getting them to use the intended scientific ideas to guide their
   actions and reflect upon the data they collect. There was little
   evidence that the cognitive challenge of linking observables to ideas
   is recognized by those who design practical activities for science
   lessons. Tasks rarely incorporated explicit strategies to help students
   to make such links, or were presented in class in ways that reflected
   the size of the learning demand. The analytical framework used in this
   study offers a means of assessing the learning demand of practical
   tasks, and identifying those that require specific support for
   students' thinking and learning in order to be effective.

AB We are witnessing a mad rush to pour educational content into games in
   an ad hoc manner in hopes that player/learners are motivated simply
   because the content is housed inside a game. A failure to base
   educational game design on well-established learning and instructional
   theories increases the risk of the game failing to meet its intended
   educational goals, and yielding students who are entertained but who
   have not acquired any academic skills or knowledge. Our review of
   standalone educational games has shown that they are not always based
   on sound educational principles and theories. We contend that, if
   academic learning is to take place, a new design paradigm must be
   developed. This article discusses the RETAIN design and evaluation
   model for educational games that was developed to aide in the
   evaluation of how well academic content is endogenously immersed and
   embedded within the game's fantasy and story context, promoters
   transfer of knowledge, and encourages repetitive usage to that content
   becomes available for use in an automatic way.

AB This article reports findings on a study of educational computer games
   used within various classroom situations. Employing an across-stage,
   mixed method model, the study examined whether educational computer
   games, in comparison to traditional paper-and-pencil drills, would be
   more effective in facilitating comprehensive math learning outcomes,
   and whether alternative classroom goal structures would enhance or
   reduce the effects of computer games. The findings indicated that
   computer games, compared with paper-and-pencil drills, were
   significantly more effective in promoting learning motivation but not
   significantly different in facilitating cognitive math test performance
   and metacognitive awareness. Additionally, this study established that
   alternative classroom goal structures mediated the effects of computer
   games on mathematical learning outcomes. Cooperative goal structure, as
   opposed to competitive and individualistic structures, significantly
   enhanced the effects of computer games on attitudes toward math
   learning.

AB Educational learning environments have changed dramatically in the last
   20 years. Advances in technology have enabled the World Wide Web and a
   sundry of other tools. In response, many researchers have argued that
   one way to understand learning in a complex world is to examine user
   interactions within Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) [Gee
   (2003). What video games have to teach us about learning and literacy.
   New York: Palgrave/St. Martin's; Squire (2003). Educational Researcher,
   35(8), 19-29; Young, Schrader, & Zheng, 2006]. However, few empirical
   investigations have explored MMOGs as a context for learning. As a
   result, a 20-item, Likert-type instrument was administered to 2140
   participants who actively play MMOGs. Items were designed to measure
   players' gaming experiences as they developed requisite skill sets and
   learned game content. Specifically, this investigation examined how
   participants' age ranges and levels of expertise relate to behaviors,
   strategies, and skills exhibited with an MMOG environment. Although
   results are not necessarily conclusive, implications for understanding
   gaming expertise in contemporary educational environments are discussed.

DE Virtual learning teams; Group development; Online education; Online

ID DECISION DEVELOPMENT; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE; TIME
AB With the advancement of Internet communication technologies,
   distributed work groups have great potential for remote collaboration
   and use of collective knowledge. Adopting the Complex Adaptive System
   (CAS) perspective (McGrath, Arrow, & Berdhal, Personal Soc Psychol Rev
   4 (2000) 95), which views virtual learning teams as an adaptive and
   self-organizing entity, this study examined group development processes
   of seven intact virtual learning teams over 12 weeks using the multiple
   case study design. Content analysis revealed seven temporal group
   development phases: orientation, scheduling, exploration, work and
   decision, progress check and evaluation, refinement and formatting, and
   termination. The development pattern of each virtual learning team
   could be described as either Linear Progression, a straight movement
   through those phases, or Adaptive Progression, a backward movement to a
   previous phase for adaptation before proceeding. We also identify the
   factors that caused each team to develop in one way or the other and
   conclude with the implications of conceptualizing virtual teams as a
   CAS.

DE Cognitive processing; Multimedia design principles; MUVEs
ID DUAL-CODING THEORY; MULTIMEDIA; WORDS
AB In this paper, we explore how the application of multimedia design
   principles may inform the development of educational multi-user virtual
   environments (MUVEs). We look at design principles that have been shown
   to help learners manage cognitive load within multimedia environments
   and conduct a conjectural analysis of the extent to which such
   principles can help manage cognitive load in the highly immersive
   "beyond multimedia" environments that 3-D educational MUVEs represent.
   We frame our discussion as a design practice analysis of the River City
   MUVE, a science inquiry environment that has middle school students
   collaborating to develop and test hypotheses regarding illnesses
   sweeping a virtual town. We analyze the current River City interface
   design using a framework describing cognitive overload scenarios and
   associated approaches to manage cognitive load. We also discuss the
   potential difficulties that may be seen as multimedia principles are
   applied to 3-D MUVEs. Our discussion describes a blueprint for research
   implementations that we are undertaking to systematically investigate
   the effect of an educational MUVE interface design based on multimedia
   principles-implementations that we hope will provide an action
   framework for other MUVE researchers to use in their own studies.

AB Educators and learning theorists suggest that play is one of the most
   important venues for learning, and games a useful educational tool.
   This study considers game activity preferences of middle school-aged
   children, so that educational games might be made more appealing to
   them. Based on children's activity modes identified in our prior
   research, we developed the Educational Game Preferences Survey, which
   collects information on children's preferences for play activity modes,
   their attitudes about each activity mode, and their preferences for
   game characters, settings, and forms of help. Survey results suggest
   the appeal of the Explorative mode of play for all children, especially
   girls. Gender differences in children's preferences and attitudes for
   Active, Strategic, and Creative play modes were also found. We close
   with recommendations for game design to appeal to both boys and girls,
   as well as for boys and girls individually, to build engagement and
   hopefully lead to learning.

DT Article
AB In this paper, we examine the meaning of conversing with pedagogical
   agents. Previous research has focused on examining cause and effect
   relationships, failing to take into account the meaning of the
   experiences individuals have when holding a dialogue with
   conversational agents for educational purposes. To understand these
   experiences, we have conducted a phenomenological examination of what
   it means to converse with a pedagogical agent. In phenomenological
   terms, findings suggest the experience is complex, engrossing, virtual
   yet real, human-like, and social. Implications for the future design,
   implementation, and research of conversational agents in educational
   and other settings are discussed.

AB The aim of this paper and the one which follows is to explore how the
   potential of computer games may be taken up in schools to support
   learning engagement among students. It is not the intention of the
   papers to dismiss existing classroom practices or overlook accounts of
   innovative practices in schools; the papers' aim is to provide
   educators who are interested in exploring the use of computer games in
   schools with information and ideas about how these games may be
   effectively used to engage students in their learning. This paper
   questions whether the empowerment of students to create games for one
   another based on the school curriculum may address the insignificance
   of computer games in the sociocultural setting of the school. Both
   papers have been commissioned by Microsoft (Asia-Pacific) under the
   Partners-In-Learning Initiative. Under this initiative, Microsoft
   establishes partnerships with ministries of education, national and
   local government bodies, and other stakeholders to empower students and
   teachers to realize their full potential, mediated by information and

TI From e-learning space to e-learning place
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper, it is argued that e-learning environments are currently
   more like 'buildings', ie, learning spaces, rather than 'schools', ie,
   places for learning. The concepts originated from architecture and
   urban design, where they are used both to distinguish static spaces
   from inhabited places, and more importantly, as design objectives. The
   transformation from space to place is supported and enabled by social
   interactions between the (learning) community members. We argue that
   this distinction between the concepts explains some of the problems
   with current e-learning systems and propose issues to consider when
   designing new systems. By acknowledging the importance and
   characteristics of a place, designers and researchers can justify the
   need and support for social interactions in learning space,
   consequently enabling social community building in e-learning
   environments, and most importantly, supporting the development of a
   user-friendly and motivating e-learning place.

TI Measuring the quality of e-learning
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper shows how concept mapping can be used to measure the quality
   of e-learning. Six volunteers (all of them 3rd-year medical students)
   took part in a programme of e-learning designed to teach the principles
   of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Their understanding of MRI was
   measured before and after the course by the use of concept mapping. The
   quality of change in individuals' maps was assessed using criteria
   developed to distinguish between meaningful and rote-learning outcomes.
   Student maps were also scored for evidence of conceptual richness and
   understanding. Finally, each map was compared directly with the content
   of the electronic teaching material.
   The results show that many of the student misconceptions were put right
   in the course of their learning but that many of the key concepts
   introduced in the teaching were ignored (or sometimes learnt by rote)
   by the students. This was because the teaching material locked these
   new ideas in structures and terminology that precluded meaning-making
   among non-experts. Our data suggest that students' prior knowledge is a
   key determinant of meaningful learning. We suggest that this must be
   acknowledged if the design and use of electronic teaching material is
   also to be meaningful. Ultimately, measures of student learning are the
   only authentic indicators of the quality of teaching through technology.

TI Contradictions between the virtual and physical high school classroom:
   A third-generation Activity Theory perspective
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID DISTANCE EDUCATION
AB This paper uses a third-generation Activity Theory perspective to gain
   insight into the contradictions between the activity systems of the
   physical and virtual high school classroom from the perspective of
   teachers who had transitioned from one system to the other. Data
   collection relied on semi-structured interviews conducted with
   e-teachers as well as management/support personnel of an organisation
   charged with delivering web-based high school courses in the Canadian
   province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Contradictions related to time
   and workload, physical presence, interaction and rapport building, and
   use of direct messaging and email. The contradictions can be explained
   by a difference between the mediating tools in each activity system.
   The absence in the virtual classroom of body language and visual
   presence as mediators requires e-teachers to find new ways of
   interacting and building rapport and necessitates a shift from a
   practice of controlling to engaging students' attention.

TI Increasing interactivity in blended classrooms through a cutting-edge
   mobile learning system
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Chinese classrooms, whether on school grounds or online, have long
   suffered from a lack of interactivity. Many online classes simply
   provide recorded lectures to which students listen after downloading.
   This format only reinforces the negative effects of passive
   non-participatory learning. At the e-Learning Lab of Shanghai Jiaotong
   University researchers and developers actively seek technologic
   interventions that can greatly increase interactivity in blended
   classes. They developed a cutting-edge mobile learning system that can
   deliver live broadcast of real-time classroom teaching to online
   students with mobile devices. Their system allows students to customise
   means of content-reception, based on when and where the students are
   tuning in to the broadcast. The system also supports short text
   messaging and instant polls. Through these venues, students can ask
   questions and make suggestions in real time, and the instructor can
   address them immediately. Here we describe this system in detail, and
   also report results from a test implementation of the system with a
   blended classroom of 1000 students (250 campus and 750 online).

TI The methodological nettle: ICT and student achievement
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A major challenge for researchers and educators has been to discern the
   effect of ICT use on student learning outcomes. This paper maps the
   achievements in Year 10 Science of two cohorts of students over two
   years where students in the first year studied in a traditional
   environment while students in the second took part in a blended or
   e-learning environment. Using both quantitative and qualitative
   methods, the authors have shown that ICT, through an e-learning
   intervention, did improve student performance in terms of test scores.
   They have also shown that this improvement was not global with the
   results for previously high-performing female students tending to fall
   while the results for lower-achieving boys rose. There was also a
   seeming mismatch between some students' affective responses to the new
   environment and their test scores. This study shows the complexity of
   ICT-mediated environments through its identification and description of
   three core issues which beset the credibility of research in ICT in
   education. These are (1) ICT as an agent of learning, (b) site
   specificity, and (c) global improvement.

ID KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION
AB Systems thinking is an essential cognitive skill that enables
   individuals to develop an integrative understanding of a given subject
   at the conceptual and systemic level. Yet, systems thinking is not
   usually an innate skill. Helping students develop systems-thinking
   skills warrants attention from educators. This paper describes a study
   examining the effects of utilising systems modelling as a cognitive
   tool in enhancing a group of graduate students' systems-thinking
   skills. A significant improvement was observed in the systems-thinking
   practises of the students. A theoretical rationale for enhancing
   systems-thinking skills with modelling and the results of the study
   will be discussed.

   may Matter in the Case of Electric Circuits
SO RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Analogies; Electric circuits; Models; Science learning; Science teaching
ID SCIENCE; EXPLANATIONS; ANALOGIES
AB Models are important both in the development of physics itself and in
   teaching physics. Historically, the consensus models of physics have
   come to embody particular ontological assumptions and epistemological
   commitments. Educators have generally assumed that the consensus models
   of physics, which have stood the test of time, will also work well as
   teaching models, and for many topics this assumption is at least
   unproblematic and in many cases productive. However, in the case of
   electric circuits the consensus models are highly abstract and
   consequently inaccessible to beginning learners. Certain historically
   derived analogues for the consensus models are accepted in texts, but
   these are demonstrably ineffective for helping learners grasp the
   fundamental concepts of electric circuits. While awareness of other
   models circulates informally in the teaching community, these are not
   well documented in the science education literature and rarely referred
   to in authoritative texts, possibly because the models do not share the
   ontological assumptions and epistemological commitments that
   characterise consensus models. Consequently these models have not been
   subjected to a disciplined critique of their effectiveness for teaching
   purposes. In this paper I use criteria drawn from the science education
   literature to reflect on why I have found particular models valuable in
   teaching electric circuits. These criteria contrast with the
   epistemological and ontological features that characterise the
   consensus models of science, and my reflection leads me to attend
   explicitly to the ways in which meanings are created within physics.
   This suggests that all models, whether consensus models or not, can be
   used more knowingly for important educational ends.

AB Introductory thermodynamics is a topic which is covered in a wide
   variety of science and engineering educations. However, very different
   teaching traditions have evolved within different scientific
   specialties. In this study we examine three courses in introductory
   thermodynamics within three different scientific specialties: physics,
   chemical engineering and mechanical engineering. Based on a
   generalization of Kuhn's theory of disciplinary matrix, and the idea of
   boundary objects we analyse how basic thermodynamics theory is
   conceived in the different scientific specialties. The study is based
   on interviews with teachers and analysis of the different textbook
   traditions. It is concluded that teachers need to take into account how
   subject matter is conceived in other related scientific specialties
   when designing courses. Two examples demonstrating how this may be done
   are given.

AB This article reports on a qualitative and quantitative study that
   explored whether a constructivist Science learning environment, in
   which 9 to 10-year old Colombian girls had the opportunity to discuss
   scientific concepts and socio-scientific dilemmas in groups, improved
   their understanding of the concepts and the complex relations that
   exists between species and the environment. Data were collected from
   two fourth grade groups in a private bilingual school, a treatment and
   a comparison group. Pre and post tests on the understanding of
   scientific concepts and the possible consequences of human action on
   living things, transcriptions of the discussions of dilemmas, and pre
   and post tests of empathy showed that students who had the opportunity
   to discuss socio-scientific dilemmas gave better definitions for
   scientific concepts and made better connections between them, their
   lives and Nature than students who did not. It is argued that Science
   learning should occur in constructivist learning environments and go
   beyond the construction of scientific concepts, to discussions and
   decision-making related to the social and moral implications of the
   application of Science in the real world. It is also argued that this
   type of pedagogical interventions and research on them should be
   carried out in different sociocultural contexts to confirm their impact
   on Science learning in diverse conditions.

AB Using multiple theoretical frameworks, reflective writings and
   interviews, this study explores preservice elementary teachers'
   emerging identities as science teachers and how this identity is
   connected to notions of critical agency and a stance toward social
   justice. The study addresses two central questions pertaining to
   preservice teachers' conceptions as "agents of change" and how their
   perceptions as change agents frame their science teacher identities and
   understanding of teaching science in urban elementary classrooms. Their
   identity in the moment as elementary preservice teachers-not yet
   teachers-influences how they view themselves as teachers and how much
   agency or power they feel they have as agents of change in science
   classrooms. Findings suggest that science teacher education must play a
   more immediate, fundamental and emancipatory role in preparing
   preservice teachers in developing science teacher identities and a
   stance toward social justice.

AB We investigated the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of nine
   experienced chemistry teachers. The teachers took part in a teacher
   training course on students' difficulties and the use of models in
   teaching acid-base chemistry, electrochemistry, and redox reactions.
   Two years after the course, the teachers were interviewed about their
   PCK of (1) students' difficulties in understanding acid-base chemistry
   and (2) models of acids and bases in their teaching practice. In the
   interviews, the teachers were asked to comment on authentic student
   responses collected in a previous study that included student
   interviews about their understanding of acids and bases. Further, the
   teachers drew story-lines representing their level of satisfaction with
   their acid-base teaching. The results show that, although all teachers
   recognised some of the students' difficulties as confusion between
   models, only a few chose to emphasise the different models of acids and
   bases. Most of the teachers thought it was sufficient to distinguish
   clearly between the phenomenological level and the particle level. The
   ways the teachers reflected on their teaching, in order to improve it,
   also differed. Some teachers reflected more on students' difficulties;
   others were more concerned about their own performance. Implications
   for chemistry (teacher) education are discussed.

AB This is a study of the opportunities currently provided by interactive
   science and technology centres for visitors' engagement in the field of
   acoustics. E-mails, requesting a description of exhibits on acoustics
   (sound and hearing) in use, were sent to members of staff of
   interactive science and technology centres around the world as well as
   to companies that design and sell exhibits. Eighty-seven descriptions
   of distinctive interactive exhibits were received and analysed. Results
   show that: there are few analogy-based exhibits concerning the more
   complex aspects of acoustics; narratives involving visitors' everyday
   lives, that might provide continuity between and beyond the situations
   presented by exhibits, are not generally provided; science is
   emphasised at the expense of technology; the risks, benefits and
   ethical implications of relevant technological artefacts are rarely
   mentioned; the majority of the exhibits are concerned with the fields
   of fundamental acoustics, hearing, and psychoacoustics. It is suggested
   that interactive science and technology centres need to rethink the
   design of exhibits about acoustics if their mission includes some
   appreciation of this important branch of science and technology.

AB In this study we examined curriculum integration in new ways by
   exploring the link between classroom context, the implementation of
   community-based, integrated science projects, and the subsequent
   student learning. The literature is inconsistent regarding the benefits
   of an integrated approach to curriculum. The research design was a
   multiple case study conducted in two classrooms in different schools.
   We employed a "worldly interpretive framework" that recognizes and
   embraces the importance of context in framing curriculum practices and
   outcomes. We found that similar projects in the two classrooms produced
   distinctly different (and equally valid) outcomes-focused either on
   bounded discipline-specific knowledge or, alternatively, on issues and
   problems that transcended disciplinary boundaries. (C) 2007 Wiley

AB An array of data suggests that low-income, minority students are
   excluded from a high-quality physics education. The education
   literature proposes that cultivating student voice in classrooms helps
   youth feel a deeper, more meaningful connection with school. However,
   limited data exist in the physics education literature on how student
   voice is expressed. The purpose of this study was to use critical
   ethnography to explore how student voice developed in the context of a
   ninth-grade conceptual physics class. I developed case studies of five
   immigrant Caribbean youth from student, family and teacher interviews,
   participant observations and field notes. I relied on grounded theory
   as an analytic technique. Findings suggest that in expressing voice,
   youth designed lessons reflective of their identities, leveraged and
   enhanced their "epistemic" and "positional" authority (two new
   constructs I propose in this manuscript), and creatively utilized
   physics and school-sponsored resources. This information about how
   students express voice has implications for how they learn physics, how
   critical theory is connected with physics classroom practice, and how
   student identity, shared authority and youth agency develop in physics
   classrooms. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 45:

AB This study investigated seventh grade learners' decision making about
   genetic engineering concepts and applications. A social network
   analyses supported by technology tracked changes in student
   understanding with a focus on social and conceptual influences. Results
   indicated that several social and conceptual mechanisms potentially
   affected how and why ideas were taken up in the learning system of the
   classroom. Mechanisms included copying or memetic processes such as "do
   as the smart students do" and friendship selection. Study outcomes are
   compared with the broader literature on memes and memetic processes to
   reveal general evolutionary ideas such as the development of prestige,
   identity versus problem-solving strategies, extended phenotypes, and
   memeplexes. Educational implications for this research are also
   addressed. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 45:

AB Considerable effort has been made over the past decade to address the
   needs of learners in large urban districts through scaleable reform
   initiatives. We examine the effects of a multifaceted scaling reform
   that focuses on supporting standards based science teaching in urban
   middle schools. The effort was one component of a systemic reform
   effort in the Detroit Public Schools, and was centered on highly
   specified and developed project-based inquiry science units supported
   by aligned professional development and learning technologies. Two
   cohorts of 7th and 8th graders that participated in the project units
   are compared with the remainder of the district population, using
   results from the high-stakes state standardized test in science. Both
   the initial and scaled up cohorts show increases in science content
   understanding and process skills over their peers, and significantly
   higher pass rates on the statewide test. The relative gains occur up to
   a year and a half after participation in the curriculum, and show
   little attenuation with in the second cohort when scaling occurred and
   the number of teachers involved increased. The effect of participation
   in units at different grade levels is independent and cumulative, with
   higher levels of participation associated with similarly higher
   achievement scores. Examination of results by gender reveals that the
   curriculum effort succeeds in reducing the gender gap in achievement
   experienced by urban African-American boys. These findings demonstrate
   that standards-based, inquiry science curriculum can lead to
   standardized achievement test gains in historically underserved urban
   students, when the curriculum is highly specified, developed, and
   aligned with professional development and administrative support. (C)

AB The attitudes towards science of upper-primary students in three
   ability strands (average, above average, and gifted) were investigated.
   A total of 580 upper primary students from co-educational government
   and government-aided schools in Singapore were involved in this study.
   The attitude subscales investigated were enjoyment of science,
   preference for science careers, and appreciation of the social
   implications of science. Gender and ability were found to have
   statistically significant effects on the variations in the mean score
   for each attitude subscale. Boys, in general, had more positive views
   about science than girls. Overall, above-average and gifted students
   had comparable attitudes towards science; both of them consistently
   showed more positive attitudes than average ability students. At least
   18% of the sample, with greater percentage being boys, reported "not
   sure" responses in 50% or more of the total attitude items. (C) 2008

AB The aims of this study were to examine self-efficacy and other
   motivation variables among high school science students (n=502): to
   determine the degree to which each of the four hypothesized sources of
   self-efficacy makes an independent contribution to students' science
   self-efficacy beliefs; to examine possible differences between life,
   physical, and Earth science classes: and to investigate patterns of
   gender differences that may vary among the fields of science. In Earth
   science classes, girls earned higher grades and reported stronger
   science self-efficacy. In life science classes, girls earned higher
   grades but did not report stronger self-efficacy, and did report higher
   science anxiety. In physical science, there were no gender differences
   in grades or self-efficacy, but girls again reported higher levels of
   science anxiety. For boys across science fields, science self-efficacy
   significantly predicted course grades and mastery experiences was the
   only significant predictor of self-efficacy. For girls, self-efficacy
   was also the strongest predictor of science grade across fields.
   Mastery experiences significantly predicted self-efficacy in Earth
   science for girls, but social persuasions, vicarious experiences, and
   physiological states were better predictors of science self-efficacy in
   life and physical science classes. Results support (Bandura, A., 1997)
   hypothesized sources of self-efficacy, previous research findings on
   self-efficacy in the domain of science, and validate the suggestion
   made by Lau and Roeser (2002) to dis-aggregate data by science field.

AB With the advent of e-learning technologies in the past decade, the
   accessibility of training, teaching, and learning has drastically
   increased. The challenge for the education enterprise now is how to
   attract learners to their c-learning services. In this study, a
   technology adoption model is developed to predict the users' intention
   of adoption and their continued use behavior. The results show
   significant evidence in support of the hypothesis. The findings
   indicate that perceptions of relative advantage and compatibility are
   significantly related to users' intention to use e-learning. Also, the
   intention is significantly related to their actual use of e-learning.
   Furthermore, the technology adoption of learners with prior e-learning
   experience is different from those without prior c-learning experience.
   These findings may contribute to deeper understanding of e-learning
   users' perceptions in terms of adoption and continued use behavior. (C)

AB This work presents the analysis of the 2001 Brazilian Basic Education
   Evaluation System (SAEB) achievement exam. The SAEB tested 4th, 8th,
   and 11th grade students, in mathematics and reading (Portuguese). We
   classified the students into seven socioeconomic classes, and for each
   class, compared the test results according to frequency of computer
   use, computer ownership, Internet access at home, and whether the
   teachers used computers and Internet as pedagogical tools. Frequency of
   computer use had, in general, a negative effect on the test results,
   and the negative effect increased for younger and poorer students.
   Computer ownership had, in general, a small positive effect on the test
   results for older students, and no effect for 4th graders. Internet
   access had a negative effect for younger and poorer students, and a
   positive effect for 11th graders. Finally, whether the teacher used
   computers or Internet as pedagogical tools had no effect on the
   student's test results for all social economic classes and grades. (C)

AB This work presents innovative cybernetics (feedback) techniques based
   on Bayesian statistics for drawing questions from an Item Bank towards
   personalized multi-student improvement. A novel software tool, namely
   Module for Adaptive Assessment of Students (or, MAAS for short),
   implements the proposed (feedback) techniques. In conclusion, a pilot
   application to two Computer Science courses during a period of 4 years
   demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Statistical
   evidence strongly suggests that the proposed techniques call improve
   student performance. The benefits of automating a quicker delivery of
   University quality education to a large body of students can be
   substantial as discussed here. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The work aims to improve the assessment of creative problem-solving in
   science education by employing language technologies and
   computational-statistical machine learning methods to grade students'
   natural language responses automatically. To evaluate constructs like
   creative problem-solving with validity, open-ended questions that
   elicit students' constructed responses are beneficial. But the high
   cost required in manually grading constructed responses could become an
   obstacle in applying open-ended questions. In this study, automated
   grading schemes have been developed and evaluated in the context of
   secondary Earth science education. Empirical evaluations revealed that
   the automated grading schemes may reliably identify domain concepts
   embedded in students' natural language responses with satisfactory
   inter-coder agreement against human coding in two sub-tasks of the test
   (Cohen's Kappa = .65-72). And when a single holistic score was computed
   for each student, machine-generated scores achieved high inter-rater
   reliability against human grading (Pearson's r = .92). The reliable
   performance in automatic concept identification and numeric grading
   demonstrates the potential of using automated grading to support the
   use of open-ended questions in science assessments and enable new
   technologies for science learning. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Exploring student test, homework, and other assessment scores is a
   challenge for most teachers, especially when attempting to identify
   cross-assessment weaknesses and produce final course grades. During the
   course, teachers need to identify subject weaknesses in order to help
   students who are struggling with a particular topic. This
   identification often needs to happen across multiple assessment data
   points and should be considered in comparison to the class's progress
   as a whole. When determining grades, fairness to all is essential, but
   there are special needs for students who did poorly on one exam or had
   a steadily increasing grasp of the subject. We present eduViz, a
   visualization tool designed to help teachers explore and assign grades.
   Teachers can see the trajectory of student scores, the relationship of
   a particular student to the class, and use categories they have defined
   in order to filter their assessment information. Query response is
   immediate and all logical comparisons are possible. Teachers can easily
   compare their query to the class or per student average as well as view
   scores by raw point total or percentage. Additionally, eduViz provides
   a grade assignment interface which allows teachers to view sorted
   student scores in a scatterplot. This scatterplot is coupled with a
   unique partition slider which allows users to move color coordinated
   bands on the scatterplot to indicate grade ranges. As these grade
   ranges are set, a histogram is updated to show the number of students
   assigned to each grade range. These features give teachers new and
   powerful ways to explore and assign grades so that they can better
   understand student strengths and weaknesses and make the most of the
   time they have available. Interviews with 16 expert teachers indicate
   that eduViz is a success across fields, provides teachers with a useful
   tool to understand and help their classes, and encourages reflective
   practice. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes the effects of learning support on
   simulation-based learning in three learning models: experiment
   prompting, a hypothesis menu, and step guidance. A simulation learning
   system was implemented based on these three models, and the differences
   between simulation-based learning and traditional laboratory learning
   were explored in the context of physics studies. The effects of the
   support type oil learning performance were also quantified. In
   second-year junior high school students it was found that the outcome
   for learning about the basic characteristics of an optical lens was
   significantly better for simulation-based learning than for laboratory
   learning. We also investigated the influences of different learning
   models on the students' abstract reasoning abilities, which showed that
   the different learning models do not have different effects on
   individuals with different abstract reasoning abilities. However, we
   found that students who are better at higher abstract reasoning benefit
   more from simulation-based learning, and also that the learning results
   are better for experiment prompting and a hypothesis menu than for step
   guidance. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For many years, researchers have searched for the factors affecting the
   use of computers in the classroom. In studying the antecedents of
   educational computer use, many studies adopt a rather limited view
   because only technology-related variables, such as attitudes to
   computers and computer experience were taken into account. The present
   study centres on teachers' educational beliefs (constructivist beliefs,
   traditional beliefs) as antecedent of computer use, while controlling
   for the impact of technology-related variables (computer experience,
   general computer attitudes) and demographical variables (sex, age). In
   order to identify differences in determinants of computer use in the
   classroom, multilevel modelling was used (N = 525). For measuring
   primary teachers' use of computers to support the leaching or learning
   process a modified version of the 'Class Use of Computers' scale of van
   Braak et al. [van Braak, J., Tondeur, J., & Valcke, M. (2004).
   Explaining different types of computer use among primary school
   teachers. European Journal of Psychology of Education, 19(4), 407-422]
   was used. The present article supports the hypothesis that teacher
   beliefs are significant determinants in explaining why teachers adopt
   computers in the classroom. Next to the impact of computer experience,
   general computer attitudes and gender, the results show a positive
   effect of constructivist beliefs on the classroom use of computers.
   Traditional beliefs have a negative impact on the classroom use of
   computers. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The current development approaches for e-learning systems fail to
   explain in a clear and consistent way the pedagogical principles that
   support them. Moreover, decisions with regard to the structuration of
   each component proposed by these approaches are mainly taken by the
   designer/developer. As a result, the ensuing e-learning systems reflect
   "common sense" rather than a theoretically informed and systematic
   design.
   The present paper proposes a global architecture model for any
   e-learning system whose blocks are extracted from the analysis of the
   main approaches that currently guide the development of these kinds of
   systems. We use Kipling's famous questions to define and structure the
   blocks of the proposed model, and we base the answers to these
   questions oil two disciplines that are closed to e-learning: presential
   education (i.e., its pedagogical theories) and knowledge management.

AB Given the prevalence of computers in education today, it is critical to
   understand teachers' perspectives regarding computer integration in
   their classrooms. The current study surveyed a random sample of a
   heterogeneous group of 185 elementary and 204 secondary teachers in
   order to provide a comprehensive summary of teacher characteristics and
   variables that best discriminate between teachers who integrate
   computers and those who do not. Discriminant Function Analysis
   indicated seven variables for elementary teachers and six for secondary
   teachers (accounting for 74% and 68%, of the variance, respectively)
   that discriminated between high and low integrators. Variables included
   positive teaching experiences with computers; teacher's comfort with
   computers; beliefs supporting the use of computers as an instructional
   tool; training; motivation; support; and teaching efficacy.
   Implications for support of computer integration in the classroom are
   discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Distance education courses must cope with the difficulties imposed by
   delivering a class at a distance. As most courses only emphasize the
   cognitive aspects of the class and neglect the course's effect on the
   students, this gives no help for reaching the affective domain teaching
   goals. Especially for younger students, in distance education, when
   younger students are out of the sight of teachers, they could easily be
   distracted by the environment around them. This research outlines a
   synchronous discussion procedure with reinforcement mechanism designed
   for elementary school students to integrate the affective aspects of
   teaching into distance education within a class period. The mechanism
   allows teachers to understand students' attitudes within the class and
   provides instant feedback to the teacher. Learners can also get
   information about their attitudes and help to reach the affective
   domain teaching goals of the courses. This mechanism was implemented
   and investigated. Comparative assessments were made by administering
   interviews and questionnaires to elementary school students. The
   results show that the procedure can supervise learners and help them
   reach the response stage of the affective domain teaching goals. (C)

AB This paper analyses the process of multimedia integration in English
   language classrooms equipped with interactive whiteboard (IWB)
   technology, and offers insights into the theoretical underpinnings of
   multimedia use in language learning from the perspective of cognitive
   learning theory. The data discussed here are drawn from a study carried
   out as part of a PhD research programme at Lancaster University (UK).
   The study was conducted within an interpretative research paradigm, and
   data were collected and analysed according to a qualitative approach.
   In the first part, the paper discusses some perceived pedagogical
   benefits of adopting a multimedia-oriented approach in the IWB-based
   classroom. Secondly, it discusses a variety of potential problems
   related to the use of multimedia resources in the language classroom in
   question. Finally, the paper draws upon the literature on multimedia
   learning to address the potential pedagogical implications of these
   research findings. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Educational software adoption across UK secondary schools is seen as
   unsatisfactory. Based on stakeholders' perceptions, this paper uses
   fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) to model this adoption context. It
   discusses the development of the FCM model, using a mixed-methods
   approach and drawing on participants from three UK secondary schools.
   The study presents three phases involved in the development of the
   model, where individual FCMs were developed in phase one and then the
   individual FCMs were aggregated in phase two. In phase three, further
   interrelationships identified from the empirical data were assigned
   weightings and added, resulting in the final FCM model. Following a
   static analysis of the model, the resulting FCM offers a visual medium
   of factors key to the adoption of educational software as perceived by
   relevant stakeholders. As a holistic model it provides insight into the
   context of educational software adoption in schools, which can be used
   to guide both educational decision-makers in where to focus their

AB The social cognitive perspective of self-regulated learning suggests
   that effective learning is determined by the interactions among
   personal, behavioral, and environmental influences; particularly, high
   self-regulated learners hold higher motivation (personal), apply better
   learning strategies (behavioral) and respond to environmental demand
   more appropriately (environmental). The study thus uses the social
   cognitive perspective to explore the role of self-efficacy (personal),
   student feedback behavior, use of learning strategies (behavioral),
   performance and receiving feedback (environmental) in Web-based
   learning. There were 76 university students participated in this study.
   Both quantitative and qualitative methods were applied for data
   analysis. The results supported that self-efficacy predicted student
   use of learning strategies and related to elaborated feedback behavior
   (personal -> behavioral). High self-efficacy students applied more
   high-level learning strategies, such as elaborative strategy and
   critical thinking. Students who provided elaborated feedback also had
   higher self-efficacy than those who did not. Moreover, receiving
   elaborative feedback significantly promoted student self-efficacy
   (environmental -> personal), while receiving knowledge of correct
   response improved student performance. However, the results indicated
   that feedback behaviors did not predict academic performance, which may
   be interfered by modeling effects. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB External representations can be powerful for supporting learners in
   both individual and collaborative learning scenarios. They encourage
   learners to focus on important instructional elements. In this study,
   we investigate two different forms of external representations:
   textually represented collaboration scripts and graphically represented
   content schemes. Fifty-three triads of university students are assigned
   to four experimental conditions involving the factors collaboration
   script and content scheme. Results show that learners particularly
   benefit from the content scheme. Its graphical elements help focus the
   learners' collaboration and they therefore achieve better outcomes. (C)

AB Employing mixed-method approach, this case study examined the in situ
   use of educational computer games in a summer math program to
   facilitate 4th and 5th graders' cognitive math achievement,
   metacognitive awareness, and positive attitudes toward math learning.
   The results indicated that students developed more positive attitudes
   toward math learning through five-week computer math gaming, but there
   was no significant effect of computer gaming on students' cognitive
   test performance or metacognitive awareness development. The in-field
   observation and students' think-aloud protocol informed that not every
   computer math drill game would engage children in committed learning.
   The study findings have highlighted the value of situating learning
   activities within the game story, making games pleasantly challenging,
   scaffolding reflections, and designing suitable off-computer
   activities. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB By the early nineties a Chilean network on computers and education for
   public schools had emerged. There were both high expectancies that
   technology could revolutionize education as well as divergent voices
   that doubted the real impact of technology on learning. This paper
   presents an evaluation of the Enlaces network, a national Information
   and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and education initiative designed
   as part of a series of programs to overcome inequity and quality issues
   of public education in Chile, by integrating teachers and learners into
   the knowledge society. Data gathered and the results obtained in four
   major areas of educational policies - infrastructure, digital literacy,
   conditions of learning, and the impact on school learning of major
   national and international tests are presented and fully analyzed. The
   strengths and weaknesses of Enlaces as a visible component of the
   educational system and educational reform are also discussed. Enlaces
   has provided basic infrastructure tools, connectivity, ICTs, and
   teacher training to a huge number of schools, but critical results are
   narrow in terms of classroom learning and no additional, competencies
   have been observed. Data and results are limited by structural
   bottlenecks in the educational and social system. Finally, the lessons
   learned after more than 15 years of implementing technology in Chilean
   schools are presented and fully discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The creation of the first SCORM (Shareable Content Object Reference
   Model) object offers some challenges and difficulties which go beyond
   the facilities offered by content generation applications. In
   particular, the creation of really reusable, searchable learning
   objects requires a detailed consideration of metadata, where same
   institutional aspects may be unclear or not available. This work
   describes creation of a first learning object, from software tools
   installation to final packaging. It aims at a wider perspective than
   that offered by handbooks or user guides for content generation tools,
   generally poor or altogether deprived of suggestions on how to go about
   to achieve reusability, interoperability, durability and accessibility
   as conceived by the SCORM standard. Only free software and Internet
   publications are used as references. The creation of a simple SCORM
   package with the Reload Editor is described step by step, and the
   package created is then tested using Reload SCORM Player, allowing for
   the detection of some difficulties and alternatives of solution. Help
   available and some commented references are afterwards indicated. A
   list of suggestions finally emerges, to the purpose of solving
   beforehand most of the uncertainties, defining a consistent learning
   object creation scheme and reducing training time to master tools and
   metadata generation. As a conclusion, some limitations found along the
   work are pointed out, in particular the necessity of adopting or
   defining a LOM (Learning Object Metadata) application profile together
   with an institutional strategy to face metadata creation efficiently.

ID INEQUALITY
AB While there is evidence that access to computers in schools has
   increased, there remain questions about whether low socio-economic
   status (SES) schools provide students with equitable supports for
   achieving information communication technology (ICT) literacy. This
   research first presents a theoretical model to examine the digital
   divide within schools. Using this model, this research uses statewide
   data from four school years to investigate significant trends in ICT
   integration by school level and SES in Florida. Multilevel models for
   repeated measures analysis were used to compare models for predicting
   trends on nine different aspects of school technology integration.
   Results show statistically significant differences between high and low
   SES schools at every level in terms of student access to software,
   student use of software, teacher use of software, and the level of
   technology support. This research provides evidence of the existence of
   the digital divide among Florida's K-12 schools. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB According to activity theory, activities are at the center of human
   behavior. Extensive attention has been given in literature to the
   success and effectiveness of online learning programs. Value theory
   suggests that human perceived value is a critical construct in
   investigating what is important to individuals. However, very limited
   attention has been given in literature to the role of users' perceived
   value of learning activities in educational settings. Scholars suggest
   that additional studies on learning activities are needed in order to
   progress the current knowledge of the use of information systems in
   education. Therefore, this study investigated issues related to
   learners' perceived value by uncovering the critical value factors
   (CVFs) of online learning activities. Participants in this study
   included 209 graduate students attending an online learning program.
   This study extended the first phase done in a prior research to uncover
   the CVFs of online learning activities. Results of this research study
   produced five reliable CVFs: (a) collaborative, social, and passive
   learning activities; (b) formal communication activities; (c) formal
   learning activities; (d) logistic activities; and (e) printing
   activities. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Technology-enhanced learning environments (TELEs) deliver instructional
   content and provide an array of scaffolding features designed to
   support independent student learning. TELEs also support teacher
   efforts to guide student inquiry within these sometimes complex
   environments. Self-efficacy, defined by Bandura [Bandura, A. (1994).
   Self-efficacy. In V. S. Ramachaudran (Ed.), Encyclopedia of human
   behavior (Vol. 4, pp. 71-81). New York: Academic Press] as a person's
   beliefs about his capabilities is also known to influence student
   academic performance in a learning environment. This paper discusses
   the potential importance of designing scaffolds in TELEs that
   intentionally promote academic self-efficacy. We advocate for designing
   asynchronous Audio/Visual tools into TELEs to promote student
   self-efficacy and ultimately performance. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Korea

DE Country-specific development; Pedagogical issues
AB The importance of ICT literacy education for students and teachers in
   the information society cannot be overemphasized. The Korean government
   had developed an ICT literacy curriculum for students and teachers
   since 2000. It announced the ICT literacy curriculum for students in
   2000 and the ISST for teachers in 2002. Most contents of the ICT
   literacy curriculum and ISST focused on teaching the use of application
   programs. However, as the IT environment changes rapidly, the parties
   concerned thought that the revision of the ICT literacy curriculum and
   ISST is indispensable. Therefore, the Korean government announced the
   revised ICT literacy curriculum for students in 2005. The revised ICT
   literacy curriculum emphasized the principles of computer science and
   problem-solving methods. However, although the ICT literacy curriculum
   was revised, there was no ICT literacy inservice training curriculum to
   reflect the revised ICT literacy curriculum.
   In this research, we designed the contents of the ICT literacy
   in-service training program based on the revised ICT literacy
   curriculum. The contents of the ICT literacy in-service training
   program consist of four sections: the Information society, information
   devices, Information processing, and Information handling. The contents
   in each section of the ICT literacy in-service training curriculum are
   divided into two groups: mandatory and optional. There were several
   findings made in this study. After analyzing the opinions and
   requirements of experts and teachers, the 'Information processing'
   section was found to be the most important part of the ICT literacy
   in-service training program. It was found that the experts and teachers
   have different views on the contents of the ICI' literacy in-service
   training program. Also, we found that effective teaching strategies and
   evaluation methods should be provided for the ICT literacy in-service
   training curriculum to be effective. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The efficiency of teaching algorithms can be highly improved by
   utilizing the senses as educational aids. The authors have developed a
   new didactical method and a software tool which exemplifies, for the
   case of simple algorithms, how the involvement of eyesight, hearing and
   the kinaesthesia can help in the teaching and learning process. This
   paper also gives a detailed description of a didactical experiment

AB The authors address the role of computer support for building
   conceptual self-awareness-that is, enabling students to think outside
   of concept boundaries in hope of enhancing creative potential. Based on
   meta-cognition theory, we developed an integrated concept mapping
   system (ICMSys) to improve users' conceptual self-awareness in addition
   to applying concept mapping techniques in traditional learning
   scenarios. Since the ICMSys accommodates different perspectives,
   selected ideas made by peers are retained with the help of integrated
   concept map (ICMap) representations used as stimuli for reflective
   thinking. Results from a case study with 32 information management
   undergraduates indicate: (a) increased levels of conceptual
   self-awareness, (b) evidence of conceptual improvement in the students'
   redrawn concept maps, (c) that Map viewing frequency exerted a positive
   impact on level of conceptual self-awareness, and (d) a significant
   correlation between level of conceptual self-awareness in redrawn
   personal concept maps and actual conceptual changes as determined by
   three experts. We describe student perceptions of the ICMSys in terms
   of comprehension practicality and conceptual self-awareness, and give
   suggestions for future research. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   31-April 4). A taxonomy of literature reviews. In Paper presented at
   the American Educational Research Association, Chicago, IL] literature
   review framework was used to locate and examine relevant literature and
   games (published between the years 2000 and 2007) and to organize and
   report findings. A total of 50 articles and 55 educational games met
   specified selection criteria. The pedagogical foundations of the games
   were further investigated by contacting the authors of the games.
   Twenty-two games were based on established learning theories or
   instructional strategies and two games included basic instructional
   events that were not associated with any particular theory or strategy.
   No information regarding the pedagogical foundations of the 31 games
   was found or received. Analysis of the games and supporting literature
   revealed several patterns of practice that may be used to guide future
   research and development of educational games. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper we present eTeacher, an intelligent agent that provides
   personalized assistance to e-learning students. eTeacher observes a
   student's behavior while he/she is taking online courses and
   automatically builds the student's profile. This profile comprises the
   student's learning style and information about the student's
   performance, such as exercises done, topics studied, exam results. In
   our approach, a student's learning style is automatically detected from
   the student's actions in an e-learning system using Bayesian networks.
   Then, eTeacher uses the information contained in the student profile to
   proactively assist the student by suggesting him/her personalized
   courses of action that will help him/her during the learning process.
   eTeacher has been evaluated when assisting System Engineering students
   and the results obtained thus far are promising. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB It is commonly argued that a key challenge for e-learning is to
   encourage learner participation. Even though this challenge has
   received increased attention by researchers, little effort has been put
   into developing a sound theoretical understanding of what online
   participation actually is and how it may be studied empirically. This
   paper examines the conceptions and research approaches that underlie
   research on online participation in e-learning settings. A
   classification scheme was iteratively developed and used when
   publications on the topic were reviewed. It was found that research is
   dominated by low-level conceptions of online participation, which
   relies on frequency counts as measures of participation. However, some
   researchers aim to study more complex dimensions of participation, such
   as whether participants feel they are taking part and are engaged in
   dialogues, reflected by using a combination of perceived and actual
   measures of participation. In conclusion, a definition of online
   learner participation that acknowledges its more complex dimensions,
   such as doing, communicating, thinking, feeling, and belonging, is
   proposed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Three years of graduating business honors cohorts in a large urban
   university were sampled to determine whether the introduction of
   ubiquitous laptop computers into the honors program contributed to
   student achievement, student satisfaction and constructivist teaching
   activities. The first year cohort consisted of honors students who did
   not have laptops; the second and third year cohorts were given laptops
   by the University. The honors students found that their honors
   classrooms were statistically significantly more constructivist than
   their traditional (non-honors) classroom. The introduction of laptop
   computing to honors students and their faculty did not increase the
   level of constructivist activities in the honors classrooms. Laptop
   computing did not statistically improve student achievement as measured
   by GPA. Honors students with laptops reported statistically
   significantly less satisfaction with their education compared to honors
   students with no laptops. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Within the scope of this study, the effectiveness of two kinds of
   instructional support was evaluated with regard to the learner's
   interests. Two versions of a simulation program about the respiratory
   chain were developed, differing only in the kind of tasks provided for
   instructional support: One version contained problem-solving tasks, the
   other one contained worked-out examples. The focus was on the learner's
   interest in the subject and in computers. The first goal of the study
   was to find to what extent computer simulations incorporating the
   different kinds of instructional support have positive effects on
   situational subject-interest. The second goal was to evaluate the
   interactions between the learner's interests and the instructional
   support with regard to the learning results (subdivided into factual
   knowledge and understanding). Simulations with worked-out examples were
   shown to have positive effects on the learner's situational interest in
   the subject. This was not found to be the case in simulations with
   problem-solving tasks. Regardless of the kind of instructional support,
   learners with little interest in the subject were able to achieve
   significant gains in factual knowledge. However, improvement in
   understanding was dependent on the kind of instructional support. (C)

AB This study investigated whether stereotype threat can influence women's
   attributions of failure in a computer task. Male and female college-age
   students (n = 86, 16-21 years old) from Germany were asked to work on a
   computer task and were hinted beforehand that in this task, either (a)
   men usually perform better than women do (negative threat condition),
   or (b) women usually perform better than men do (positive condition),
   or (c) they received no threat or gender-related information (control
   group). The final part of the task was prepared to provide an
   experience of failure: due to a faulty USB-memory stick, completion of
   the task was not possible. Results suggest a stereotype threat effect
   on women's attribution of failure: in the negative threat condition,
   women attributed the failure more internally (to their own inability),
   and men more externally (to the faulty technical equipment). In the
   positive and control conditions, no significant gender differences in
   attribution emerged. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article focuses on the use of online interactive peer feedback in
   higher education and identifies the successful uptake of feedback as an
   important aspect. We investigate the link between the nature of
   students' feedback, the way it is evaluated by the receiver, and its
   consecutive use for the revision of students' products. Two separate
   studies were conducted to investigate the link between these three
   variables across different educational contexts and tools. Both studies
   showed a significant relationship between feedback containing concrete
   suggestions and a successful uptake of the feedback. Regarding the
   different tools that were used, these concrete suggestions were more
   often produced in the Annotation system than in the Blackboard
   discussion forum, the latter showing more evaluative forms of feedback.
   We also found significant relationships between elements of both the
   nature and the reception of feedback on the one hand, and the use of
   this feedback by the receiver on the other hand. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper describes a comprehensive set of studies designed to assess
   the potential for commercial reading programs to teach reading in
   science. Specific questions focus on the proportion of selections in
   the programs that contain science and the amount of science that is in
   those selections, on the genres in which the science is portrayed, on
   the areas and topics of science covered, on the accuracy of the
   scientific content, oil the text features used to communicate the
   science, and on the instructional strategies and assessment techniques
   recommended. The findings show that commercial reading programs have
   changed substantially from the days when they were dominated by
   literary texts and contained hardly any science. Now, there is a
   variety of genres and scientific content in about one fifth of the
   selections. The content is also generally accurate. So, there is
   considerable potential offered by these programs for teaching children
   to read science. Unfortunately, the findings also show that the
   recommended instructional strategies and assessment techniques do
   little to capitalize upon this potential. In particular, the findings
   demonstrate that, although most of the science is cast in the
   expository genre, most of the recommended instruction and assessment is
   more appropriate to the literary genres. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals,

TI Making students' thinking explicit in writing and discussion: An
   analysis of formative assessment prompts
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID FEEDBACK; SCIENCE; PERFORMANCE; DIFFERENTIATION; DENSITY; WEIGHT
AB The National Research Council ([NRC], 2001) has stated that formative
   assessment is essential to fulfilling the mission of the National
   Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996). This paper explores the
   relative utility of four different types of formative assessment
   prompts in eliciting middle school students' ideas about sinking and
   floating. Students' written responses and statements in classroom
   discussions around each of the prompts are compared. Results indicate
   that the relative success of the prompts in eliciting a range of
   conceptions may depend on the openness and familiarity of the prompts.
   Prompts with fewer constraints and unfamiliar settings elicited a range
   of student conceptions in writing; however, discussions surrounding the
   prompts were more likely to elicit ideas at the expected level, or no
   student ideas at all. A comparison of the prompts revealed that the
   diversity of students' responses in writing was not reflected in
   classroom discussions. The study suggests that open-format formative
   assessment prompts may function better when used as a basis for
   teachers to elicit a range of student ideas in writing, whereas
   constrained-outcome space prompts may be more appropriate for
   whole-class conversations that focus students upon scientifically
   appropriate responses. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This case study explores how an American Indian woman experienced
   scientific discourse and the issues of language, power, and authority
   that occurred while she was an undergraduate student at a university in
   the southwestern United States. This ethnographic research, using a
   phenomenological perspective, describes her experiences as she searched
   for the discursive resources she required to cross-cultural borders
   between her traditional worldview and Eurocentric science. Data from
   interviews, participant observation, and artifacts offer a narrative of
   bow she became aware of the "game rules" of scientific discourse. The
   findings are expressed in terms of a cartographic metaphor where the
   student's world became less of a list of categories and more of a map
   outlining where she ventured and the ways in which she oriented herself
   to scientific language. To facilitate the border crossing and reduce
   the obstacles that some students experience in crossing between
   worldviews, educators can look at cross-cultural perspectives and
   explore with students how language fosters or hinders their progress.
   This research suggests that we allow room in our pedagogy for students
   to learn the rules of using scientific language, make explicit the
   cultural norms associated with this practice, thereby promoting a
   "metaknowledge" of how scientific discourse functions in the academy.

AB Previous research has indicated that the use of multiple
   representations with macroscopic and molecular features can improve
   conceptual understanding; however, the influence of prior knowledge of
   the domain cannot be overlooked. Using eye-tracking technology nd
   sequential analysis. this study investigated how high school students
   (n = 54) with different levels of prior knowledge transitioned among
   the macroscopic and molecular representations of the selected cell
   transport graphics. The results indicated that high prior knowledge
   students transitioned more frequently between the molecular
   representations, whereas low prior knowledge students transitioned more
   frequently between the macroscopic representations. These findings
   suggest that students with high prior knowledge distributed their
   Visual attention on conceptually relevant features, whereas low prior
   knowledge students focused on surface features. In addition, low prior
   knowledge students transitioned more frequently between macroscopic and
   molecular representations, suggesting that these students were
   experiencing more difficulty as they were coordinating the
   representations. Because these students were using surface features to
   create linkages between the representations, they were unable to
   understand the underlying themes. More research on the differences in
   the distribution of visual attention among learners can provide further
   insight as to the difficulties low prior knowledge students face when
   interpreting multiple representations. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This paper examines the nature of kindergarten students' science
   learning from an inquiry unit in which they investigated the life cycle
   of the monarch butterfly. The unit was implemented in a public school
   serving a socioeconomically, ethnically, and linguistically diverse
   student population. The paper provides descriptive data on children's
   science learning from their investigations. The descriptive data were
   collected during the implementation of the inquiry unit using an
   electronic portfolio system. A second set of data on science learning
   was collected using an objective, researcher-de signed instrument
   called the Science Learning Assessment (SLA). These data were collected
   from children in the intervention who completed the inquiry unit and
   from a comparison group of kindergarten students that was similar in
   demographic characteristics but did not receive systematic science
   instruction. The comparison group provides baseline data about
   kindergarten students' science concepts in the absence of targeted
   science instruction. There were 100 participants (65 intervention and
   35 comparison students). Results indicate that intervention students
   demonstrated a functional understanding of scientific inquiry processes
   and of important life science concepts during their investigations.
   Statistical analyses of SLA data indicate that the intervention group
   showed significantly better understanding of scientific inquiry
   processes than the comparison group. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Curriculum materials are a crucial tool with which teachers engage in
   teaching practice. For preservice teachers to learn to use science
   curriculum materials in productive ways, they must develop a conception
   of themselves as elementary teachers in which the use of science
   curriculum materials is a valued dimension of science-teaching
   practice. We define those dimensions of teachers' professional role
   identities concerned with the use of curriculum materials as curricular
   role identity. This mixed-methods study examines preservice elementary
   teachers' development of curricular role identity for science teaching
   through their use of science curriculum materials. Forty-seven
   preservice elementary teachers in two sections of an elementary science
   methods course were studied over the course of one semester. Data
   sources include survey results from preservice teachers in both course
   sections as well as interviews, observations, and course artifacts from
   preservice teachers studied in-depth. Results suggest preservice
   teachers articulate important differences between their own and more
   experienced elementary teachers' curricular role identity for science
   teaching and make progress toward appropriating the latter. Supporting
   them to do so requires emphasizing interactions with science curriculum
   materials as part of teacher education and providing classroom-based
   experiences through which they can put their developing curricular role
   identities into action. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB One hundred years after its conception, the scientific method continues
   to reinforce a kind of cultural fore about what it means to participate
   in inquiry. As commonly implemented in venues ranging from middle
   school classrooms to undergraduate laboratories, it emphasizes the
   testing of predictions rather than ideas, focuses learners on material
   activity at the expense of deep subject matter understanding, and lacks
   epistemic framing relevant to the discipline. While critiques of the
   scientific method are not new, its cumulative effects on learners'
   conceptions of science have not been clearly articulated. We discuss
   these effects using findings from a series of five studies with
   degree-holding graduates of our educational system who were preparing
   to enter the teaching profession and apprentice their own young
   learners into unproblematic images of how science is done. We then
   offer an alternative vision for investigative science-model-based
   inquiry (MBI)as a system of activity and discourse that engages
   learners more deeply with content and embodies five epistemic
   characteristics of scientific knowledge: that ideas represented in the
   form of models are testable, revisable, explanatory, conjectural, and
   generative. We represent MBI as an interconnected set of classroom
   conversations and provide examples of its implementation and its
   limitations. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In this paper, we examine the nature and extent of participation of
   Canadian young women and men in science-based academic fields. Informed
   by Bourdieu's theory of cultural reproduction, we focus on three key
   stagessenior secondary school, the transition to post-secondary
   studies, and the post-secondary completion stageto determine whether
   and how the interrelationships of gender, cultural capital, course
   completion in senior secondary school, timing of decisions, and initial
   participation in post-secondary education lead to the completion of
   science-related undergraduate degrees. Through correspondence analyses
   of 10 years of longitudinal data with 1,055 respondents, we extend the
   findings of cross-sectional studies that examine only one aspect of
   this longitudinal story by showing how the intersection between
   organisational structures (institutional and disciplinary) and cultural
   capital transmitted by the family shapes the opportunity structures of
   access to scientific fields of study by young women and men.

AB Chemical phenomena can be described using three representation modes:
   macro, submicro, and symbolic. The way students use and connect these
   modes when solving conceptual problems was studied, using a think-aloud
   interview protocol. The protocol was validated through interviews with
   six faculty members, and then applied to four graduate and six
   undergraduate chemistry students. We used a 'levels of complexity'
   framework to analyse responses: the macro and symbolic modes were
   considered system-level representations, and the submicro mode a
   component-level representation. We found that faculty members thought
   of system-level properties as emerging from mechanistic interactions
   between particles on the component levelan emergent perspective. In
   many cases, the students either failed to connect the system and
   component levels, or thought of system-level properties as guiding the
   behaviour of particles on the component levela 'submergent'
   perspective. Some students used their familiarity with a symbolic
   equation describing the behaviour of a substance as the starting point
   of a thought process that leads them to impose mechanistically
   unwarrantable behaviour upon its particles. We concluded that a
   submergent perspective inhibits students from confronting their
   misconceptions regarding particle behaviour, and explains why students
   are often able to correctly solve algorithmic problems while failing to
   solve conceptual ones. It is suggested that the directionality of
   connecting particle behaviour to system-level properties should be
   emphasized in teaching.

AB This research investigates the role of experience in relation to
   teachers' beliefs and practices. The study adopted a social-cultural
   constructivist perspective using an interpretive approach. The research
   was guided by teachers' interpretations of their experiences related to
   teaching science through Science-Technology-Society (STS) issues. These
   interpretations are re-interpreted to find meaningful conceptual
   categories (grounded in the data) from which to build a model to
   understand the influence of experiences within socio-Islamic culture on
   teachers' beliefs and practices. Data was collected from ten teachers
   using interviews and observations. The findings of this study suggest
   that it was mainly teachers' personal religious beliefs and experiences
   that shaped their beliefs and practices. The research also led to a
   model, constructed on the basis of the data analysis, which suggests an
   explanation of how teachers' personal religious beliefs and experiences
   influence their beliefs and practices.

   teaching sequences, and the communicative approaches as they alternate
   in classroom activities. In this case study, we follow the interactions
   between the teacher and a pair of students during an entire teaching
   sequence in Optics (grade 11). We focus on the way the teacher managed
   the dialogicity and the modelling processes in the classroom discourse.
   A qualitative analysis shows some difficulties in such an achievement,
   and their consequences on students' meaning making.

TI Tensions in the biology laboratory: What are they?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PRACTICAL WORK; SCIENCE; STUDENTS
AB The purpose of this paper is to identify tensions in teacher-student
   interaction in a high school biology laboratory. Using micro-analytic
   analysis of classroom talk, the interaction between the students and a
   teacher working in the biology laboratory session on Reproduction in
   Plants is studied. The two tensions highlighted here are tension with
   textbooks as authority and tension with the teacher as authority.
   Tension with textbooks as authority originates from an over-reliance on
   generalizations expressed in textbooks resulting in the inability of
   learners to appreciate alternatives and exceptions. Tension with the
   teacher as authority stems from the task design and varying levels of
   control that a teacher has over the learner and the learning process.
   The genesis of the two forms of tensions in the laboratory is different
   and they are tackled differently by the participants to yield different
   outcomes. While science educators have conducted intensive research
   over the past two decades on the effects of school science laboratory
   work on students' learning of science, more can be done in the specific
   area of teacher-student interaction. This paper offers some insights
   into the interaction between a teacher and her students in a laboratory
   as they learn biology. An increased understanding of the impact of the
   tensions in a science laboratory might help to bring about realization
   of the true spirit and intent of school science laboratory experiences.

TI From flowers to fruits: How children's books represent plant
   reproduction
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID NONFICTION TRADE BOOKS; ELEMENTARY SCIENCE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; SCHOOL;
   INSTRUCTION; ANIMALS
AB Children's trade books about science may be playing an increasing role
   in science instruction; however, the potential effects on student
   learning are unknown. To investigate whether a subset of books would be
   appropriate for classroom instruction about a specific science topic
   (plant reproduction), a selection of children's books about plants was
   analysed to identify how plant reproduction was portrayed and whether
   the book could generate misconceptions about the topic. Three types of
   data were collected from 69 children's books: growth progression of the
   plant, textual passages describing reproduction, and descriptions of
   illustrations related to reproduction. These data were then sorted
   twice: once to identify coding categories for how plant reproduction
   was shown in the books, and a second time to identify potential
   misconceptions in the books. Most of the books showed plants
   progressing through a lifecycle that generated a fruit or seed.
   However, there were three categories of explanations for this process:
   no mechanism, implicit mechanism, and explicit mechanism. The analysis
   also identified five inaccuracies in the books that could support
   misconceptions about plant reproduction. Overall, students could learn
   from these books that plants make flowers that generate fruits or
   seeds, and that pollination or bees support this process. However, the
   gaps in the explanations of plant reproduction would require the
   teacher to supplement, or in some cases correct, the text. It is
   recommended that content experts analyse children's books in their area
   of specialty and provide teachers with recommendations about the use of
   the books in classrooms.

   make use of their own mobile devices to support informal learning. In
   this study, a survey was used to investigate whether, and to what
   extent, experienced users of mobile devices use their mobile devices to
   support intentional informal learning. If so, do they make use of
   mobile device connectivity to support opportunistic informal learning
   and does such connectivity support or encourage collaborative informal
   learning? Experienced mobile device users were recruited from web
   forums and business, and asked whether they used their devices to
   support informal learning. A pattern of learning uses emerged, some of
   which deployed the mobile device capabilities relatively unchanged,
   others triggered adaptations to typical learning activities to provide
   a better fit to the needs of the learner. These informal learning
   activities provided the basis for the design of a flexible mobile
   learning framework that can be extended to support developments in
   mobile technology, and increasing use of Web 2.0 technologies by
   informal learners.

AB Undergraduate students access the Internet for a range of purposes,
   many unrelated to their studies. Increasingly, learners are using the
   Internet to find information and resources for coursework, whether or
   not this is promoted or endorsed by their teachers. This article
   reports an interview study that investigated why and how independent
   learners use Web-based resources, exploring not only the academic
   context of the courses studied, but also any relevant personal,
   domestic and employment-related circumstances. Factors were identified,
   which enhanced or competed with study activities, acting as incentives
   or disincentives for learners. The findings suggest that it is not
   technologies per se, but a combination of various contextual factors,
   that determine students' use of Web resources for learning. Of the
   academic factors that emerged from the interviews, assessment
   requirements and pedagogic approach were particularly important.

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE action research; e-learning; pedagogy; peer observation; quality

AB This paper describes a collaborative action research approach used to
   explore peer observation of teaching (POT) within the online
   environment. Although POT has become familiar in face-to-face teaching
   contexts, little is understood of its potential role in online
   settings. We conducted 'virtual' focus groups to explore the experience
   and views of 28 teachers and subjected our data to a thematic analysis.
   This informed the implementation of an innovative programme of POT,
   'Peer-to-peer Reflection on Pedagogical Practice' (PROPP) among tutors
   of a Web-based MSc in International Primary Health Care at University
   College London. Modeled on an action learning set, the programme
   encourages collaborative reflection on teaching practices, based on
   participants' specific examples of online teaching. The PROPP model is
   consistent with Quality Enhancement, which we distinguish from Quality
   Assurance. Here, we describe the implementation of the PROPP programme
   within an action research framework and identify the factors that we
   consider critical to the success of peer observation within online
   courses. We highlight examples of aspects of teaching that have been
   discussed within the PROPP programme and offer suggestions of the kinds
   of evidence that could be incorporated into a portfolio to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of such an initiative.

TI The effects of animations on verbal interaction in computer supported

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE animation; collaboration; CSCL; multimedia; snapshots; verbal
   interaction
AB This paper focuses on the interaction patterns of learners studying in
   pairs who were provided with multimedia learning material. In a
   previous article, we reported that learning scores were higher for
   dyads of an 'animations' condition than for dyads of a 'static
   pictures' condition. Results also showed that offering a persistent
   display of one snapshot of each animated sequence hindered
   collaborative learning. In the present paper, further analyses of
   verbal interactions within learning dyads were performed in order to
   have a better understanding of both the beneficial effect of animations
   and the detrimental effect of the presence of persistent snapshots of
   critical steps on collaborative learning. Results did not show any
   differences in terms of verbal categories between the two versions of
   the instructional material, that is, static versus animated pictures.
   Pairs who were provided with persistent snapshots of the multimedia
   sequences produced fewer utterances compared to participants without
   the snapshots. In addition, the persistent snapshots were detrimental
   both in terms of providing information about the learning content and
   in terms of producing utterances solely for the purpose of managing the
   interaction. In this study, evidence also showed that these two verbal
   categories were positively related to learning performances. Finally,
   mediation analyses revealed that the negative effect of persistent
   snapshots was mediated by the fact that peers of the snapshots
   condition produced less information providing and interaction
   management utterances. Results are interpreted using a psycholinguistic
   framework applied to computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL)
   literature and general guidelines are derived for the use of dynamic
   material and persistency tools in the design of CSCL environments.

AB We investigated whether and how prior knowledge activation improves
   learning outcomes for high school (less experienced learners) and
   university students (experienced learners) in a hypertext environment.
   Map coherence was defined as the extent to which relationships between
   the concepts in the map were made explicit. Therefore, we classified
   the mapping task of creating and labelling lines as low-coherent, and
   the mapping task of labelling provided lines as high-coherent. Learners
   were randomly assigned to the conditions of (1) high-coherent knowledge
   activation; (2) low-coherent knowledge activation; and (3) a baseline
   condition without prior knowledge activation. We found an overall
   effect for prior knowledge activation, learning experience, and an
   interaction between learning experience and the coherence of the prior
   knowledge activation task on learning outcomes. High school students
   benefited most from labelling provided lines, while university physics
   majors benefited most from creating and labelling lines. This
   interaction effect and effects of the specific mapping tasks on process
   measures support the claim that different prior knowledge activation
   tasks are suited for different groups of learners.

TI Serious games for higher education: a framework for reducing design

ID COMPUTER; SIMULATIONS
AB Serious games open up many new opportunities for complex skills
   learning in higher education. The inherent complexity of such games,
   though, requires large efforts for their development. This paper
   presents a framework for serious game design, which aims to reduce the
   design complexity at conceptual, technical and practical levels. The
   approach focuses on a relevant subset of serious games labelled as
   scenario-based games. At the conceptual level, it identifies the basic
   elements that make up the static game configuration; it also describes
   the game dynamics, i.e. the state changes of the various game
   components in the course of time. At the technical level, it presents a
   basic system architecture, which comprises various building tools.
   Various building tools will be explained and illustrated with technical
   implementations that are part of the Emergo toolkit for scenario-based
   game development. At the practical level, a set of design principles
   are presented for controlling and reducing game design complexity. The
   principles cover the topics of game structure, feedback and game
   representation, respectively. Practical application of the framework
   and the associated toolkit is briefly reported and evaluated.

ID KNOWLEDGE; PROJECTS
AB The successful adoption of information and communication technology to
   enhance learning can be very challenging, requiring a complex blend of
   technological, pedagogical and organizational components, which may at
   times require the resolution of contradictory demands and conflicting
   needs. The research reported in this paper investigated and analysed
   critical success factors (CSFs) that are required to deliver e-learning
   within higher education (HE) courses and programmes. The research
   design adopted a critical research approach, instantiated by focus
   group discussions with e-learning experts drawn from administrative,
   educational, technology and research domains. The findings revealed
   that staffing issues, pedagogically sound delivery models and training
   of both tutors and students cannot be treated as trivial issues and are
   critical to the success of e-learning. Furthermore, this research also
   shows that there is a strong relationship between these factors and
   inspirational institutional leadership. The findings also suggest that
   in order to assure the success of e-learning, this leadership should
   guarantee the presence of institutional enablers. It is hoped that the
   CSFs, described and discussed in depth in this paper, will provide a
   suitable theoretical foundation to underpin the successful delivery of
   e-learning within HE.

TI Turning crisis into opportunity: Enhancing student-teachers'
   understanding of nature of science and scientific inquiry through a
   case study of the scientific research in severe acute respiratory
   syndrome
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CONCEPTIONS; VIEWS; CONTEXT; EXPLICIT; HISTORY
AB Interviews with key scientists involved in research on severe acute
   respiratory syndrome (SARS), together with analysis of media reports
   and documentaries produced during and after the SARS epidemic, revealed
   many interesting aspects of nature of science (NOS) and authentic
   scientific inquiry. This novel insight into practice in the rapidly
   growing field of molecular biology was used in the development of
   instructional materials for use in the pre-service and in-service
   teacher education programme at The University of Hong Kong. The
   elements of NOS and scientific inquiry identified in the scientific
   research on SARS were explicitly emphasized in our instructional
   materials. The contemporary real-life context of SARS was found to be
   effective in promoting student-teachers' understanding of NOS and
   scientific inquiry, particularly in terms of: the realization of
   inseparable links between science and the social, cultural, and
   political environment; deeper understanding of how science and
   technology impact on each other; and a richer appreciation of the
   processes of authentic scientific inquiry and the humanistic character
   of scientists. The effectiveness is attributed to immediacy, relevance,
   and familiarity, making the abstract tangible, personal experience of
   science history, and the powerful affective impact of the interviews
   with scientists.

DT Article
ID PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE; SUBJECT-MATTER KNOWLEDGE; PERFORMANCE;
   SCIENCE; INSTRUCTION; SKILLS
AB The present article presents a rubric we developed for assessing the
   quality of scientific explanations by science graduate students. The
   rubric was developed from a qualitative analysis of science graduate
   students' abilities to explain their own research to an audience of
   non-scientists. Our intention is that use of the rubric to characterise
   explanations of science by scientists, some of whom become professors,
   would lead to better teaching of science at the university level. This
   would, in turn, improve retention of qualified and diverse scientists,
   some of whom may elect to become science teachers. Our rubric is useful
   as an instrument to help evaluate scientific explanations because it
   distinguishes between the content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge
   of scientists, as well as a scientist's ability to integrate the two in
   the service of a clear and coherent explanation of his or her research.
   It is also generally useful in evaluating, or self-evaluating, science
   explanations by science professors and researchers, graduate students
   preparing to be scientists, science teachers and pre-service teachers,
   as well as students who are explaining science as part of learning.

AB Achievement disparities among racial groups attest to the elusiveness
   of the 'science for all' goal, an emphasis of reform efforts in the
   USA. One popular approach to making science accessible to all is group
   work. The study investigated roles attained by five African American
   and six European- American eighth graders working in small, racially
   mixed groups. What roles did the African-American and European-
   American students attain in the small, racially mixed science groups?
   Did race-associated patterns of role attainment exist? If so, what was
   the nature of the patterns? Roles were derived and patterns examined
   via the qualitative and quantitative analyses of videotaped group
   interactions. The findings indicated that European- Americans attained
   roles more frequently than their African-American counterparts of
   comparable abilities and whiteness operated in the small groups. The
   findings imply racial inequities in group work and the need for
   teachers to consider race when employing it.

AB The present paper reports the design process and the experimentation of
   a teaching-learning sequence about the concept of mechanical wave
   propagation and the role played by media where waves are propagating.
   The sequence focuses on the central issue of the relationships between
   observable phenomena, like macroscopic behaviours of waves, and their
   interpretation and/or explanation in terms of corpuscular
   characteristics of media. We describe the design process with respect
   to the general framework of the Educational Reconstruction Model and
   the pedagogical tools used. Results of a teaching/learning experiment,
   involving a sample of 75 high school students, are also reported. Data
   analysis is mainly based on qualitative research methods. The main
   focus is on students' representations of phenomena and on the cognitive
   strategies put in action in order to modify or support their
   descriptive and interpretative mental models. Results are discussed by
   pointing out the efficacy of strategies focusing on the process of
   constructing predictive conceptual models and by identifying the
   concept of 'level of analysis' as different ways to look at the same
   phenomenon.

AB A thorough understanding of chemical bonding requires familiarity with
   the particulate nature of matter. In this study, a two-tier
   multiple-choice diagnostic instrument consisting of ten items (five
   items involving each of the two concepts) was developed to assess
   students' understanding of the particulate nature of matter and
   chemical bonding so as to identify possible associations between
   students' understandings of the two concepts. The instrument was
   administered to 260 Grades 9 and 10 students (15-16 years old) from a
   secondary school in Singapore. Analysis of students' responses revealed
   several alternative conceptions about the two concepts. In addition,
   analysis of six pairs of items suggested that students' limited
   understanding of the particulate nature of matter influenced their
   understanding of chemical bonding. The findings provide useful
   information for challenging students' alternative conceptions about the
   particulate nature of matter during classroom instruction in order to
   enable them to achieve better understanding of chemical bonding.

   A case study
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE-EDUCATION; COMMUNITIES
AB This case study explores the affordances a weblog (blog) offered to
   "Ms. Frizzle," an urban middle school science teacher and exceptional
   blogger, to support her professional identity development. The 316
   posts she wrote over 1 school year were systematically analyzed and
   triangulated with data from e-mail exchanges and interviews with Ms.
   Frizzle and her colleagues. Ms. Frizzle used her blog to tell stories
   of herself and her classroom, reflect on her practice, work through
   dilemmas, solicit feedback, and display competence, among other things.
   By doing so, she was able to wrestle with many issues that are central
   to the practice of urban science teaching and be recognized by herself
   and others as a "reform-minded" teacher committed to excellence and
   equity in education. To realize these benefits, however, Ms. Frizzle
   invested significant time and energy into her blogging and made certain
   uses of blogging features. Thus, although this study empirically
   supports the potential of blogging for teachers' professional identity
   development, it also indicates that the way in which teachers use
   blogging will determine the extent of the benefits they call derive
   from this practice.

AB This article examines how conversations during design reviews in which
   8th-grade mathematics students shared population models with visiting
   specialists expanded the disciplinary expertise of the classroom.
   Re-contextualizing is a conversational exchange that visiting
   specialists initiated to invite groups to consider their models in
   novel contexts. Analysis of 14 design reviews in 2 classrooms showed
   that re-contextualizing resulted in both the elaboration of ideas
   students already understood and new contributions to students'
   understandings of mathematical aspects of population modeling. This
   article presents case studies of 2 groups that differed in terms of
   their interest in the curricular task and the level of conceptual
   integrity of their population models. Despite these differences, the
   re-contextualizing exchanges that emerged in their design reviews led
   to new insights for both groups and provided them with opportunities to
   try on ways of thinking and acting like population biologists.

AB Teaching science as explanation is fundamental to reform efforts but is
   challenging for teachers-especially new elementary teachers, for whom
   the complexities of teaching are compounded by high demands and little
   classroom experience. Despite these challenges, few studies have
   characterized the knowledge, beliefs, and instructional practices that
   support or hinder teachers from engaging their students in building
   explanations. To address this gap, this study describes the
   understandings, purposes, goals, practices, and struggles of one
   third-year elementary teacher with regard to fostering Students'
   explanation construction. Analyses showed that the teacher had multiple
   understandings of scientific explanations, believed that fostering
   students' explanations was important for both teachers and students,
   and enacted instructional practices that provided opportunities for
   students to develop explanations. However, she did not consistently
   take Lip explanation as a goal in her practice, in part because she did
   not see explanation construction as a strategy for facilitating the
   development of students' content knowledge or as an educational goal in
   its own right. These findings inform the field's understanding of
   teacher knowledge and practice with regard to one crucial scientific
   practice and have implications for research on teachers and
   inquiry-oriented science teaching, science teacher education, and
   curriculum materials development.

AB Groups that created more correct ideas (correct contributions or CCs)
   might be more likely to solve a problem, and students' recent actions
   (micro-time context) might aid CC creation. 80 high school students
   worked in groups of 4 on an algebra problem. Groups with higher
   mathematics grades or more CCs were more likely to solve the problem.
   Dynamic multilevel analysis statistically identified watersheds
   (breakpoints) that divided each group's conversation into distinct time
   periods with many CCs versus few CCs, and modeled the groups' 2,951
   conversation turns. Wrong contributions, correct evaluations of one
   another's ideas, justifications, and polite disagreements increased the
   likelihood of a CC. In contrast, questions, rude disagreements, and
   agreements reduced it. Justifications had the largest effects, whereas
   the effects of correct evaluations lasted 3 speaker turns. Some effects
   differed across groups or time periods. In groups that solved the
   problem, justifications were more likely to yield CCs, and questions
   were more likely to elicit explanations. Meanwhile, the effects of
   agreements and correct evaluations on CCs differed across time periods.
   Applied to practice, teachers can encourage Students to evaluate
   others' ideas carefully and politely, express and justify their own
   ideas, and explain their answers to group members' questions.

AB In this study we explore the strategies that undergraduate and graduate
   chemistry students use when engaged in classification tasks involving
   symbolic and microscopic (particulate) representations of different
   chemical reactions. We were specifically interested in characterizing
   the basic features to which students pay attention when classifying
   chemical reaction at the symbolic and microscopic levels. We identified
   the categories that students create when classifying chemical
   reactions, and compared the performance in simple classification tasks
   of students with different levels of preparation in the discipline. Our
   results suggest that advanced levels of expertise in chemical
   classification do not necessarily evolve in a linear and continuous way
   with academic training; a significant proportion of undergraduate
   students, regardless of their preparation in chemistry, based their
   classification schemes on the identification of surface features and
   failed to create chemically meaningful classes. Students' ability to
   identify chemically meaningful groups was strongly influenced by their
   recent learning experiences and their graduate work in chemistry. The
   level of features used to build a class, and the role that these
   features played during the classification process. Although all of the
   participants in our study expressed similar levels of unfamiliarity
   with the microscopic chemical meaning. (C) 2007 Wiley periodicals, Inc.

AB This study employed hierarchical linear models (HLM) to investigate
   Peer-Led Guided Inquiry (PLGI), a teaching practice combining
   cooperative learning and inquiry and tailored for a large class.
   Ultimately, the study provided and example of the effective
   introduction of a reform pedagogical approach in a large class setting.
   In the narrative, the strengths of HLM as a statistical technique are
   discussed in the context of pedagogical reforms, and the case is made
   for the use of HLM in rigorous determinations of both effectiveness and
   equity associated with reform practices. The implementation of PLGI in
   a college-level general chemistry course is also described. For the
   study, two general HLM models suited to investigating reform were
   showed that the reform was associated with statistically significant
   improvement over traditional pedagogy in terms of academic performance
   on multiple measures, but achieving equity remained elusive: the
   consequences of pre-existing achievement gaps did not lessen as a
   result of reform implementation. The analysis led to several
   implications for educational research, particularly in terms of
   evaluating pedagogical reforms, for classes of any size. (C) 2008 Wiley

AB This study examined how the National Board Certification (NBC) process,
   espccially the portfolio creation, influenced candidate teachers'
   pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). In a larger sense, this study
   aimed to construct a better understanding of how teachers develop PCK
   and to establish ecological validity of the National Board assessments.
   Qualitative research methods, most notably case study, were utilized.
   Participants were three high school science teachers who were going
   thorough the NBC process. Data sources included classroom observations,
   interviews, teachers' reflections, and researcher's field notes. Data
   were analyzed using the constant comparative method and enumerative
   approach. Findings indicated that the NBC process affected five aspects
   of the candidate teachers' instructional practices that were closely
   related to PCK development: (a) reflection on teaching practices, (b)
   implementation of new and/or innovative,c teaching strategies, (c)
   inquiry-oriented instruction (d) assessments of students' learning, and
   (e) understanding of students. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study assessed the representations of nature of science (NOS) in
   high school chemistry textbooks and the extent to which these
   representations have changed during the past four decades. Analyses
   focused on the empirical, tentative, inferential, creative,
   theory-driven, and social NOS, in addition to the myth of "The
   Scientific Method," the nature of scientific theories and the social
   and cultural embeddedness of science. A total of 14 textbooks,
   including five "series" spanning one to four decades, were analyzed.
   The textbooks commanded significant market shares in the United States
   and were widely used in some of the most populace states. Relevant
   textbook sections were scored on each of the target NOS aspects on a
   scale ranging from -3 to +3, which reflected the accuracy,
   completeness, and manner (explicit versus implicit) with a few
   exceptions, textbook scores either did not change or decreased over the
   past four decades. These trends are incommensurate with the discourse
   in national and international science education reform documents, which
   has witnessed an increasing emphasis on the centrality of NOS to
   scientific literacy and pre-college science education during the same
   time period. Assessment and evaluation strategies, and policies need to
   be targeted if substantial and desired changes in the ways NOS is
   addressed in science textbooks are to be effected. (C) 2008 Wiley

AB With the proliferation of online games, understanding users' intention
   to play online games has become a new issue for academics and
   practitioners. Prior studies have investigated the factors affecting
   behavioural intention to play online games. However, little research
   has been conducted to investigate the gender differences in the
   acceptance of online games. Thus, this study is to investigate the
   effects of perceived playfulness and its potential antecedents (ie,
   computer self-efficacy, computer anxiety, challenge, speed and
   feedback) on the behavioural intention to play online games, and to

   IMPACT
AB In this study, we observed and interviewed six teachers from two
   Singapore primary school classrooms. The schools were reportedly
   achieving high levels of computer integration as reflected in a
   nationwide questionnaire survey. Out of the 18 lessons that we
   observed, 14 lessons have incorporated some elements of constructivist
   teaching. However, closer examination revealed that the underlying
   orientation of the lessons was inclined towards information acquisition
   and regurgitation. Five out of the six teachers we interviewed were
   reportedly inclined towards constructivist notion of teaching. The
   teachers accounted for the inconsistency between their espoused beliefs
   and the teacher-centric teaching practice as due to contextual
   constraints. The teachers expressed that the need to complete the
   syllabi according to stipulated schedules so as to get the students
   ready for examination was the main barriers that prevented them from
   engaging in more constructivist teaching. This case study therefore
   highlights that although it is necessary for teachers to hold
   pedagogical beliefs that are compatible with the constructivist notion
   of teaching and learning, this is an insufficient condition to shift
   traditional teaching practice. Changes in assessment systems and
   substantial professional development are further conditions that have
   to be addressed.

TI The effects of cognitive thinking styles, trust, conflict management on
   online students' learning and virtual team performance
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE
AB Cognitive style has been regarded as one of the important variables to
   predict individual cognitive functioning. This paper describes an
   empirical study that examined the role of thinking styles in relation
   to students' online learning and teamwork performance. Two hundred and
   eight students in an online MBA (Master of Business Administration)
   program participated in the study. Data were collected through surveys
   and content analysis of online conference transcripts. Sternberg's
   thinking style inventory was used to measure two dimensions of
   cognitive style: levels and scope. A personal reflection questionnaire
   was administrated to measure some variables concerning virtual team
   experiences including trust, conflict management styles and teamwork
   satisfaction. The evidence gathered suggests that cognitive styles may
   be a poor indicator of students' overall online learning performance.
   However, cognitive style had predictive power over the students'
   satisfaction with their teamwork experience, as well as the level of
   trust they exhibited in their team members. This study implies that it
   would be useful to integrate cognitive styles of individual students as
   one of the design factors which could foster successful online virtual
   team experiences.

TI Does the discussion help? The impact of a formally assessed online
   discussion on final student results
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID EDUCATION
AB While there is agreement that participation in online asynchronous
   discussions can enhance student learning, it has also been identified
   that there is a need to investigate the impact of participation in
   online discussions on student course performance. This paper presents a
   case study based on an undergraduate engineering management unit
   employing a formally assessed online discussion area. It was observed
   that while many students read a significant number of discussion
   postings, generally, the posting of new and reply messages occurred at
   the minimum level required to qualify for the assignment marks. Based
   on correlation and multiple regression analysis, it was observed that
   two variables were significantly related to a student's final unit
   mark-prior academic ability and the number of new postings made to the
   online discussion. Each new posting contributed three times as much to
   the final unit mark as its nominal assessment value, suggesting that
   the work in preparing their new discussion postings assisted students
   in the completion of a range of assessable tasks for the unit. The
   number of postings read was not significantly correlated with the final
   unit mark, suggesting that passive lurking in this online discussion
   did not significantly contribute to student learning outcomes.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CLASSROOM
AB Intellectual, social, managerial and technical are four commonly
   reported categories of facilitation in online discussions. The purpose
   of this study was to investigate whether these four broad categories of
   facilitation were equally applied in online discussions and which
   specific skills were perceived to be more important. In this study,
   students were facilitators of online discussions. Each
   student-facilitator led a group discussion and participated in two
   additional discussions moderated by other student-facilitators. Three
   groups of students were selected for data collection. Results indicated
   that the intellectual, social and managerial categories of facilitation
   were highly applied, while technical facilitation was less used in the
   online discussions. Also, summarising discussions was perceived to be
   the top facilitation skill. This paper presents findings of the study
   and discusses issues involved in the study.

TI How day of posting affects level of critical discourse in asynchronous
   discussions and computer-supported collaborative argumentation
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In asynchronous threaded discussions, messages posted near the end of
   the week provide less time for students to critically examine and
   respond to ideas presented in the messages than messages posted early
   in the week. This study examined how the day in which messages are
   posted (early, midweek and weekend) in computer-supported collaborative
   argumentation affect the number of responses elicited by arguments and
   challenges, and how its effects differ across the four types of
   exchanges (argument-challenge, challenge-counterchallenge,
   challenge-explain, challenge-evidence) that serve as indicators of
   critical discourse. This study found that the day of posting had a
   significant effect on the number of responses elicited per message,
   with the greatest to smallest effect on argument-challenge,
   challenge-counterchallenge, challenge-explain and challenge-evidence
   exchanges respectively. These findings highlight some of the
   limitations of asynchronous discussions, and suggest alternative ways
   to implement and design discussion environments to promote higher
   levels of critical discourse.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

ID STUDENT
AB This study examined how question types influenced the quantity and
   quality of undergraduate students' online submissions. Discussion
   questions were structured based on one of six question types: direct
   link, course link, brainstorm, limited focal, open focal and
   application. Transcripts of eight online discussions involving 114
   participants were analysed on these dependent variables: word count,
   degree of answer completion, and level of higher-order thinking.
   Results indicated the question types differentially influenced
   students' submissions on all dependent variables. Limited focal
   question type, followed by brainstorm, open focal and direct link
   types, was most influential for word count and degree of answer
   completion. Course link, brainstorm and direct link types were most
   influential in generating higher-order thinking, although students
   mainly engaged in lower-order thinking across all question types.

TI 'Intentional repetition' and learning style: Increasing efficient and
   cohesive interaction in asynchronous online discussions
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
ID INSTRUCTION; DESIGN; EDUCATION; LEARNERS; ISSUES
AB This study verified the efficacy of the intentional repetition
   technique in improving interaction in asynchronous online discussions
   by taking into account the learning styles of the participants. A
   conceptual framework served for the development of the technique, which
   conceptualises efficient and cohesive interaction on a continuum of
   process that move from social presence to production of an artefact.
   Sixty-one university students participated in the study. A
   quasi-experimental research design was used. The subjects, who were
   assigned randomly into two groups, were tested using Kolb's learning
   style inventory. The results showed that the experimental group exposed
   to the intentional repetition technique produced significantly better
   interaction than the control group, regardless of their learning
   styles, which had no significant effect on the interaction. Moreover,
   there was no interaction effect between the learning styles and the
   treatment. The implications arising from these results identify various
   suggestions for increasing the coherence and depth of the interaction
   amongst students in asynchronous online discussions.

AB The present study focused on investigating the effectiveness of
   instruction via newly developed teaching materials based on cooperative
   learning when compared to a traditional approach, on ninth grade
   students' understanding of metallic bonding. Fifty-seven ninth grade
   science students from two science classes in the same high school
   participated in this study. The same teacher taught metallic bonding
   with cooperative learning to an experimental group (N = 28) and with a
   traditional teacher centred approach to a control group (N = 29).
   Students' conceptual understanding of metallic bonding was measured
   using the Metallic Bonding Concept Test. The results from the Student's
   t test indicated that the mean score of the students in the
   experimental group was significantly higher in the experimental group
   (78.60, SD = 8.62), than in the control group (54.33, SD = 9.11) after
   treatment. In the light of the results from the concept test and
   individual interviews, the misconceptions related to metallic bonding
   were found less in the experimental group than traditional. Five of
   these misconceptions were firstly identified in this study. The
   individual interviews which were done with students from experimental
   group immediately after the instruction showed that students had
   positive perceptions about their cooperative work experiences.

AB The aim of this study was to explore the extent to which the
   characteristics of two teaching interventions can bring about cognitive
   progress in preschoolers with regard to the factors rolling friction
   depends on, when it is applied to an object that is freely rolling on a
   horizontal surface. The study was conducted in three phases: pre-test,
   teaching intervention, and post-test. Two teaching strategies were
   compared: one inspired by Piaget's theory (Piagetian approach) and one
   inspired by post-Piagetian and Vygotkian assumptions (socio-cognitive
   approach). A statistically significant difference was found between the
   pre-test and post-test, providing evidence that the socio-cognitive
   approach allows for the creation of a more appropriate teaching
   framework compared to the Piagetian one.

AB Physics teachers' approaches to teaching physics are generally
   considered to be linked to their views about physics. In this
   qualitative study, the views about physics held by a group of physics
   teachers whose teaching practice was traditional were explored and
   compared with the views held by physics teachers who used conceptual
   change approaches. A particular focus of the study was teachers' views
   about the role of mathematics in physics. The findings suggest the
   traditional teachers saw physics as discovered, close approximations of
   reality while the conceptual change teachers' views about physics
   ranged from a social constructivist perspective to more realist views.
   However, most teachers did not appear to have given much thought to the
   nature of physics or physics knowledge, nor to the role of mathematics
   in physics.

ID STUDENTS
AB Volunteer non-major chemistry students taking an introductory
   university chemistry course (n = 17) were interviewed about their
   understanding of a variety of chemical diagrams. All the students'
   interviewed appreciated that diagrams of laboratory equipment were
   useful to show how to set up laboratory equipment. However students'
   ability to explain specific diagrams at either the macroscopic or
   sub-microscopic level varied greatly. The results highlighted the poor
   level of understanding that some students had even after completing
   both exercises and experiments using the diagrams. The connection
   between the diagrams of the macroscopic level (equipment, chemicals),
   the submicroscopic level (molecular) and the symbolic level (equations)
   was not always considered explicitly by students. The results indicate
   a need for chemical diagrams to be used carefully and more explicitly
   to ensure learner understanding. Correspondingly, students need to
   interpret visual chemical diagrams using meta-visualization skills
   linking the various levels of representation, and appreciating the role
   of the diagrams in explanations need to be developed.

AB This study used both quantitative and qualitative analyses to examine
   the influence of written arguments on learning in a college level
   introductory biology class and the types of metacognition employed by
   students while writing. Comparison of a treatment and control group
   indicates that the writing assignments used had minimal impact on
   overall content learning as measured by conventional exams. Subsequent
   interviews and think-aloud protocols with a subset of students
   indicated that writing arguments had the potential to foster learning
   through forward and backward search strategies. However, few of the
   students took advantage of this opportunity to use metacognitive
   skills. This study suggests that preparing written arguments is not
   sufficient, by itself, to have a reliable effect on student learning
   and is consistent with the view that students must be explicitly taught
   when and how to use different metacognitive strategies.

AB Most studies indicate primary students' attitudes towards and interest
   in science decline as they progress into the secondary years.
   Longitudinal qualitative research exploring this phenomenon is rare as
   is research which focuses on the students' voice as they cross the
   interface. In this study multiple qualitative data sources, supported
   by a 'science interest' composite scale, followed 20 students over 2
   years. In contrast to baseline data on their peers these students, in
   general, maintained their interest in science. Apart from identifying
   the teacher's pedagogical approach and classroom environment as two key
   issues in understanding these students' journeys, the importance of
   listening to and heeding the students' voice may be an even more
   critical concern in addressing the decline in students' attitudes and
   interest in science.

AB This paper explores the development of student-teachers' pedagogical
   content knowledge (PCK) during pre-service education. Four
   student-teachers in mathematics and science participated in a project
   teaching physics to students aged 9-11 years once a week over a
   12-month period. One-third of the lessons were videotaped and the
   student-teachers were later interviewed using the videotape for
   stimulated recall. Participants reflected on their classroom practice
   based on their conceptual understanding of physics. This empirical
   study emphasises the role of teaching experience and reflection in
   science teacher education as a way of better understanding the complex
   entities that constitute a knowledge base for teaching. The paper draws
   attention to the value of student-teachers participating in experiences
   that might contribute to the development of their PCK and supports a
   view of PCK development as a process of transformation.

AB While the development of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) is
   considered to be a goal of teacher education, teaching about the
   concept itself is an unusual practice. In this case study, we explore
   the outcomes when a teacher educator explicitly introduces
   student-teachers to ideas about PCK through the use of a CoRes and
   PaP-eRs conceptualisation. The case study explores how, through this
   purposeful use of PCK in a pre-service science teacher programme,
   student-teachers' thinking about their teaching and about their
   development as science teachers is shaped.

ID CHEMISTRY; VIEWS
AB This paper investigates the developing pedagogical content knowledge
   (PCK) of nine experienced science teachers in their first few years of
   teaching a new science syllabus in the Dutch secondary education
   system. We aimed to identify the content and structure of the PCK for a
   specific topic in the new syllabus, 'Models of the Solar System and the
   Universe', describing the PCK development in terms of relations between
   four different aspects: knowledge about instructional strategies;
   knowledge about students' understanding; knowledge about assessment of
   students; and knowledge about goals and objectives of the topic in the
   curriculum. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in three
   subsequent academic years. From the analysis of the data, two
   qualitatively different types of PCK emerged. Type A can be described
   as oriented towards model content, while Type B can be typified as
   oriented towards model content, model production, and thinking about
   the nature of models. The results also indicate that these two types of
   PCK developed in qualitatively different ways.

AB Science teacher educators recognise a professional learning continuum
   for teachers. This has resulted in studies of science teachers at
   different career stages, with the goal of building an understanding of
   teacher learning from preparation through practice. While these
   explorations help build an understanding about teacher learning over
   time, the work is far from complete. The present study tackles one
   aspect of teacher knowledgepedagogical content knowledge (PCK)from the
   perspective of the teacher. Specifically, it depicts the PCK of
   experienced secondary science teachers who are serving as mentors to
   beginning science teachers. Each teacher ultimately conceptualised PCK
   as the knowledge for teaching science, and all of the teachers had the
   following components in their individual models: science, goals,
   students, curriculum organisation, assessment, teaching, and resources.
   Each teacher, however, had a personalised representation that directed
   his or her instructional decisions and actions. While these findings
   are from a small pool of exceptional teachers, they articulate
   components that experienced teachers may need to benefit from
   professional development programmes, along with ways in which these
   components can interact with practice. A preliminary understanding of
   the components and their interaction can assist those who plan and
   implement professional development programmes for science teachers.

TI The place of subject matter knowledge in pedagogical content knowledge:
   A case study of South African teachers teaching the amount of substance

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE; STUDENTS; MOLE; CONCEPTIONS
AB This paper presents two South African case studies designed to explore
   the influence of subject matter knowledge on pedagogical content
   knowledge (PCK). In the first case study on teaching the mole in two
   township schools, the findings illustrate that the participant teachers
   favoured procedural approaches at the expense of conceptual
   understanding. The second case study examines the teaching of chemical
   equilibrium to students on a bridging programme in a tertiary
   institution. Through these data the authors present a model to assist
   in understanding the amalgamation of subject matter knowledge (SMK)
   with other teacher knowledge domains to produce what we describe as
   'manifestations'. The model was useful in interpreting the teachers'
   practice, especially to highlight the role of SMK, and therefore offers
   interesting insights into the nature of PCK and its influence on
   science teaching.

TI Undergraduate professors' pedagogical content knowledge: The case of

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MOLE CONCEPT; SCIENCE
AB This paper documents the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of four
   university professors in General Chemistry for the topic 'amount of
   substance'; a fundamental quantity of the International System of Units
   (SI). The research method involved the development of a Content
   Representation and the application of Mortimer's Conceptual Profile
   Model to evaluate the way in which participants structured their
   knowledge of the topic. Five conceptual profile zones were defined:
   perceptive/intuitive, empiricist, formalist, rationalist, and formal
   rationalist. These zones were then used as criteria to classify
   participants' PCK as articulated in the framework of their Content
   Representations. As a consequence, four different conceptual profile
   graphs were constructed by plotting the percentage of times that each
   conceptual profile zone appeared. These conceptual profile graphs
   revealed the ways in which each professor conceptualised his or her
   teaching of 'amount of substance'.

DT Article
AB This paper considers how the notion of pedagogical content knowledge
   (PCK) has developed and changed over the past 20 years. It draws on the
   preceding papers in this special issue to reflect on the big picture
   issues and ideas that are important in shaping understandings of PCK
   and the nature of research on PCK. The paper is structured around four
   sections. The first section offers analysis of the characteristics of
   PCK as employed by the researchers in this volume, raising some issues
   related to the construct. The second section considers the implications
   for research design that result from these authors' views of PCK. The
   third section suggests an agenda for future research on science teacher
   knowledge. The concluding section examines the continuing value of the
   PCK construct for the science education community.

ID ENVIRONMENTS; WEB
AB This paper researches the effects that students' metacognitive
   knowledge has on their participation in online forum discussions, which
   form part of a web-based asynchronous course based on a constructivist
   instructional approach. Metacognitive knowledge increases learners'
   ability to be independent learners, which is an indispensable
   characteristic of the distant learner. The study was carried out with
   32 third-grade pre-service teachers. Each message in the forum
   discussions was analyzed in terms of interaction types identified by
   McKinnon ( 2000) and also scored using a grading rubric developed by
   the researchers. The metacognitive knowledge of the pre-service
   teachers was measured by the component of the General Metacognition
   Questionnaire. Sixty-seven percent of the pre-service teachers were at
   the high or medium-to-high metacognitive knowledge level and mostly
   sent messages having "example to idea," "clarification and
   elaboration," or "idea to example" type interactions. Pre-service
   teachers who exhibited low metacognitive knowledge, however, mostly
   forwarded messages having " acknowledgments," " unsubstantiated
   judgment," or "thoughtful query" type interactions. Moreover,
   metacognitive knowledge of the pre-service teachers uniquely explained
   21.4% of the variance in the online participation score. We concluded
   by outlining some implications metacognitive knowledge has on forum
   discussions in relation to the constructivist approach.

   was devised and deployed to supplement learning activities in the
   traditional classroom. A series of quasi-experiments was conducted with
   innovative instructional designs, that is, web-enabled problem-based
   learning (PBL), self-regulated learning (SRL), and their combinations.
   The impacts of these web-enabled pedagogies on students, instructors,
   and course design were evaluated. The effects of web-enabled pedagogies
   were mostly positive, thus reinforcing the instructor's confidence for
   further application to the rest of his courses. The authors further
   discuss the implications for schools, scholars, and teachers who plan
   to implement, or are already engaged in, e-learning.

AB Turkey has been undertaking many projects to integrate Information and
   Communication Technology (ICT) sources into practice in the
   teaching-learning process in educational institutions. This research
   study sheds light on the use of ICT tools in primary schools in the
   social studies subject area, by considering various variables which
   affect the success of the implementation of the use of these tools. A
   survey was completed by 326 teachers who teach fourth and fifth grade
   at primary level. The results showed that although teachers are willing
   to use ICT resources and are aware of the existing potential, they are
   facing problems in relation to accessibility to ICT resources and lack
   of in-service training opportunities.

AB The purpose of this study was to understand, describe and interpret the
   uses of information communication technology (ICT) in primary education
   in the Taiwan Schools Cyberfair as a means to expand and enhance
   student learning in an extra-curricular setting. Four winning schools,
   with 48 teachers and students involved, were purposefully selected for
   study. The research findings revealed that students in each group were
   highly motivated through the extensive use of ICT. Through long-term
   engagement with ICT, students were empowered to conduct both wider and
   deeper exploration of their selected topics of interest. We report and
   describe the effects of using ICT. In this study, three collaborative
   learning models for applying ICT in project-based learning (PBL) mode
   are identified in the specific contexts: the SCGP model (same class,
   grade, and project); the DCGSP model (different class and grade, same
   project) and the DCGP model (different class, grade, and project). In
   addition, we identify a new and important collaborative model, SPECS,
   which stands for school (intra), parents, enterprises, community, and
   school (inter). The SPECS model connects all the possible participants
   involved in the ICT-enabled activities that contributed to the success
   of the outstanding performances of the four winning schools at the
   Schools Cyberfair contest. In the conclusion we discuss some specific
   issues relating to PBL.

AB This paper describes a controlled experiment concerning the use of a
   learning aid during an open and distance learning (ODL) course. The
   core issue of investigation is whether this instructional aid can
   support, guide, and scaffold the distant student in his/her study. For
   this purpose, a controlled experiment was conducted with the
   participation of 191 undergraduate students at the department of
   informatics at a university in Greece. The considered domain was two
   lessons concerning human-computer interaction (HCI), the first in
   usability engineering and the second in interface evaluation
   methodologies. A test session was also conducted to collect data on the
   assessment of the effectiveness of the proposed tool. Descriptive
   statistics as well as a variety of statistical methods have been
   applied to the collected data in order to test the research hypotheses.
   The results have shown a statistically significant difference in
   performance for the student group that used the tool. In order to
   validate these results, a validity evaluation was also considered and
   presented. Finally, concerns about the application of the tool in a
   broader context and further research on the area are also presented.

AB The authors describe their design for an Internet-based learning
   environment called BeyondShare in which students are encouraged to gain
   a deep understanding of the learning material, reflect on the quality
   of individual constructions through sharing and peer evaluation, and
   synthesize cross-unit knowledge by integrating self-and peer-produced
   constructions. A sharing typology may consist of basic sharing, sharing
   with notification, sharing with feedback, or sharing with interaction.
   BeyondShare distinguishes itself by combining sharing activities with
   task structuring and cooperation/competition to achieve active
   learning. A formal evaluation of BeyondShare was performed with a class
   of 34 college students who created concept maps for a computer
   programming language and who were encouraged to become active learners
   by exchanging roles throughout the experiment. Evaluation results
   indicate that the students viewed BeyondShare as an easy-to-use
   environment that motivated them toward comprehensive knowledge
   integration by sharing construction products with their peers.
   Potential activities and suggested modifications are discussed.

AB This article discusses the application of the established principles of
   instructed language learning in a cyber fact-to-face environment
   supported by an advanced Synchronous Learning Management System (SLMS).
   Following a critical review of the use of SLMS in distance language
   learning, the main body of the article focuses on the discussion of
   results from an empirical study, in reference to the relevant
   principles of instructed language learning formulated by Ellis (2005).
   These results indicate that principles of instructed language learning
   for traditional classroom-based learning are equally applicable in
   cyber face-to-face learning, but with their own characteristics.
   Recommendations for the effective use of SLMSs for online synchronous
   language learning are also put forward.

AB This study is an investigation of the use of multimedia components such
   as visual text, spoken text, and graphics in a Web-based
   self-instruction program to increase learners' English vocabulary
   learning at Myungin Middle School in Seoul, South Korea. A total of 172
   middle school students (14 years of age) in five classes participated
   in the study. Each individual was required to complete several testing
   instruments such as a pretest, posttest, retention test, and attitude
   inventory. Participants learned better when they received "visual text
   and added graphics" or "visual text, added spoken text, and added
   graphics" instruction. Although the added multimedia components
   required learners to spend more time on the instruction, the extra time
   was not significant. The results lead one to conclude that an effective
   way to improve learning of English vocabulary is to offer graphics that
   illustrate what the vocabulary means.

AB This paper reports the findings from an experimental study involving
   thirty three secondary school students (mean age = 15.5 years) in
   spatial visualization (SV) training through an interactive desktop
   virtual environment spatial trainer (iDVEST). Stratified random
   sampling was used to assign students into two experimental groups and
   one control group. The first experimental group trained in
   interaction-enabled DVEST (i-DVEST), the second experimental group
   trained in animation-enhanced DVEST (a-DVEST), and the control group
   received conventional training. A multi-factorial pretest posttest
   design procedure was used and data were analyzed using 2-way ANCOVA.
   Participants trained in i-DVEST made the highest improvement gain in
   SV, followed by those trained in a-DVEST, and the control group
   achieved the lowest improvement gain. In general, male participants
   achieved higher SV improvement gain compared to female participants.
   Interaction effect between method of training and gender was observed
   indicating that male students tended to benefit more when trained in
   i-DVEST, moderately in a-DVEST, and poorly in conventional method. On
   the other hand, female students seemed to benefit from training
   irrespective of the method used.

ID DESIGN
AB For competences development of learners and professionals, target
   competences and corresponding competence development opportunities have
   to be identified. Personal Recommender Systems (PRS) provide personal
   recommendations for learners aimed at finding and selecting learning
   activities that best match their needs. This article argues that a
   clear-cut description of the concept of 'competence' is needed for
   appropriate system-based personal recommendations. It is proposed to
   extend current initiatives on standardization of modelling competences
   with the concept of 'Learning and performance situation' (LP-situation)
   and it is claimed that this extension has added value for personal
   recommendations for adequate selection of learning activities, for
   determining proficiency levels of competences, for the design of
   learning tasks, and for accreditation of prior knowledge. Advantages
   and disadvantages are discussed.

AB Since English has been an international language, how to enhance
   English levels of people by useful computer assisted learning forms or
   tools is a critical issue in non-English speaking countries because it
   definitely affects the overall competition ability of a country. With
   the rapid growth of wireless and mobile technologies, the mobile
   learning has been gradually considered as a novel and effective
   learning form because it inherits all the advantages of e-learning as
   well as breaks the limitations of learning time and space occurring in
   the traditional classroom learning. To provide an effective and
   flexible learning environment for English learning, this study adopts
   the advantages of the mobile learning to present a personalized
   intelligent mobile learning system (PIMS) which can appropriately
   recommend English news articles to learners based on the learners'
   reading abilities evaluated by the proposed fuzzy Item Response Theory
   (FIRT). In addition, to promote the reading abilities of English news,
   the unknown or unfamiliar vocabularies of individual learner can also
   be automatically discovered and retrieved from the reading English news
   articles by the PIMS system according to the English vocabulary ability
   of individual learner for enhancing vocabulary learning. Currently, the
   PIMS system has been successfully implemented on the personal digital
   assistant (PDA) to provide personalized mobile learning for promoting
   the reading ability of English news. Experimental results indicated
   that the proposed system provides an efficient and effective mobile
   learning mechanism by adaptively recommending English news articles as
   well as enhancing unknown or unfamiliar vocabularies' learning for
   individual learners.

   or indirect instructional methods on pre-service teachers' achievement,
   metacognition, and attitudes towards web-based course. Two groups, a
   total of 63 third grade elementary science and mathematics education
   pre-service teachers, attended to one of the aforementioned web-based
   courses. The results indicated that the group exposed to the web-based
   indirect instruction significantly outperformed the group exposed to
   the web-based direct instruction in the final exam but not in the
   midterm exam and in the metacognitive questionnaire. On the other hand,
   the group exposed to the web-based direct instruction had significantly
   higher attitudes towards web-based course than the one exposed to the
   web-based indirect instruction.

   participation (SRP) in online courses. Students' social ability is
   predicted by perceived ease of use of social awareness tools and
   self-reported participation. Satisfaction with online learning is
   explained by sense of community, social ability, and self-reported
   participation. Sense of community is shown to be a mediator of the
   relationships between social ability and satisfaction (SA double right
   arrow S) and between perceived usefulness and satisfaction (PU double
   right arrow S). Additionally, students' social ability, perception of
   usefulness of social awareness tools, and self-reported participation
   serve as predictors for students' sense of community. The findings from
   the path analysis show the value of simultaneously examining the
   relationships among the multiple social constructs, rather than simply
   examining relationships of how one construct may predict another as has
   been shown in previous studies.

ID ACCEPTANCE; INTERNET; TECHNOLOGY; UNIVERSITY; KNOWLEDGE
AB In the current study, the Distance Education Student Satisfaction
   Model, estimated as a structural equation model, is proposed to
   understand better what predicts student satisfaction from online
   learning environments. In the present study, the following variables
   are employed based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis,
   Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989) and literature: computer knowledge,
   flexibility of distance education, usefulness of distance education,
   and distance education satisfaction. Results suggest that as long as
   students have the skills to use online tools and perceive that distance
   education is a useful and flexible way of learning, communicating, and
   sharing, their enjoyment from online instruction will be promoted.
   Ultimately, this satisfaction may lead to higher levels of engagement,
   learning, and success in the distance education setting. Data collected
   from 195 undergraduate students are analyzed using Statistical Package
   for the Social Sciences and Analysis of Moment Structures statistical
   software. Implications of the findings of the present study are crucial
   for instructors, practitioners, and institutions planning to offer or
   currently engaged in offering distance education courses.

ID ONLINE; COMMUNICATION; WORK
AB As the integration of community-centred teaching practices intensifies,
   an understanding of the types of relationships that manifest in this
   network and the associated impact on student learning is required. This
   paper explores the relationship between a student's position in a
   classroom social network and their reported level of sense of
   community. Quantitative methods, such as Rovai's (2002b) Classroom
   Community Scale and social network centrality measures, were
   incorporated to evaluate an individual's level of sense of community
   and their position within the classroom social network. Qualitative
   methods such as discussion forum content analysis and student
   interviews were adopted to clarify and further inform this
   relationship. The results demonstrate that the centrality measures of
   closeness and degrees are positive predictors of an individual's
   reported sense of community whereas, betweenness indicates a negative
   correlation. Qualitative analyses indicate that an individual's
   pre-existing external social network influences the type of support and
   information exchanges an individual requires and therefore, the degree
   of sense of community ultimately experienced. The paper concludes by
   discussing future recommendations for teaching practices incorporating
   computer-mediated communications.

AB This article aims at discussing how Dynamic Decision Network (DDN) can
   be employed to tackle the challenges in modeling temporally variable
   scientific inquiry skills and provision of adaptive pedagogical
   interventions in INQPRO, a scientific inquiry exploratory learning
   environment for learning O'level Physics. We begin with an overview of
   INQPRO and a highlight of the computer algorithm as well as the design
   of our proposed DDN model. We then present an instance of interactions
   with INQPRO to describe how the proposed model can be generated
   dynamically by aggregating different INQPRO Graphical User Interfaces
   (GUIs) in real-time basis to perform probabilistic assessments of the
   two scientific inquiry skills (Hypothesis Formulation. and Variable
   Identification zeta). In this study, we carried out a two-phase
   empirical evaluation to investigate the performance of the proposed DDN
   model in categorizing different groups of learners. The performance of
   the proposed DDN model is identified by its matching accuracies
   elicited from a total of 6 domain experts and 77 learners who
   participated in both evaluation phases. Based on the empirical results,
   we summarized that the proposed DDN model is practically sound as it
   has demonstrated acceptable estimation accuracies with reference to the
   classification results obtained from the pretest, posttest, and from
   domain experts.

AB Computer adaptive testing (CAT) is theoretically sound and efficient,
   and is commonly seen in larger testing programs. It is, however, rarely
   seen in a smaller-scale scenario, such as in classrooms or business
   daily routines, because of the complexity of most adopted Item Response
   Theory (IRT) models. While the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT)
   model is less complicated, it only provides the examinee's mastery
   result. We thus propose an SPRT-based adaptive testing approach that is
   simpler to implement while still being able to approximate IRT scores
   in semantic or rank levels for flexible assessment needs. An English
   adaptive testing prototype is implemented and benchmarked to the Test
   of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) testing results. Generally,
   this research empirically demonstrates the validity of the proposed
   SPRT-based testing approach as well as the technical feasibility for
   teachers and business organizations to really take advantage of CAT in
   their daily routines.

AB Automatic Essay Assessor (AEA) is a system that utilizes information
   retrieval techniques such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA),
   Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), and Latent Dirichlet
   Allocation (LDA) for automatic essay grading. The system uses learning
   materials and relatively few teacher-graded essays for calibrating the
   scoring mechanism before grading. We performed a series of experiments
   using LSA, PLSA and LDA for document comparisons in AEA. In addition to
   comparing the methods on a theoretical level, we compared the
   applicability of LSA, PLSA, and LDA to essay grading with empirical
   data. The results show that the use of learning materials as training
   data for the grading model outperforms the k-NN-based grading methods.
   In addition to this, we found that using LSA yielded slightly more
   accurate grading than PLSA and LDA. We also found that the division of
   the learning materials in the training data is crucial. It is better to
   divide learning materials into sentences than paragraphs.

AB During the past decade, many enterprises have been re-directing their
   resources into critical business areas to keep up with economic and
   market changes. They have adopted electronic business (EB) systems,
   such as supply chain management, enterprise resource planning (ERP),
   and enterprise application integration (EAI), to ensure seamless
   integration with internal processes as well as suppliers and customers.
   This phenomenon indicates that EB systems are playing an important role
   in attaining the effectiveness of enterprise operations. However, there
   is a constant complaint from recruiters that EB professionals with the
   right skills are hard to come by. To gauge the rapid changes in EB
   education and industry demand, EB curricula from top universities and
   job announcements from popular career Web sites in both the US and
   Taiwan are collected. We analyze the data and compare the results
   between the two countries to recommend remedial actions for narrowing
   the gap between industry and academia. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB This paper describes the results and implications of a study into the
   effectiveness of a blended e-learning cooperative approach (BeLCA) on
   Pre-Service Teacher's (PST) achievement, attitudes towards e-learning
   and cooperativeness. Quantitative and qualitative methodologies were
   used with participants of the study. Twenty-six science PSTs, enrolled
   in an Egyptian university, represented the study's experiential and
   control groups. Pre and post-tools were administered to participants in
   the two groups in a quasiexperimental design. Instruments to measure
   dependent variables of the study were developed by the authors in light
   of relevant previous studies.
   The findings suggest that PSTs in the experimental group have higher
   achievement levels in their post-overall-course-test,
   'comprehensive-score', and attitudes towards e-learning environments
   compared to those of the control group. The specific design of the
   course may be responsible for these changes. Future implications and
   suggestions for teacher educational programmes are presented. (c) 2007

AB Design patterns have become a widely acknowledged software engineering
   practice and therefore have been incorporated in the curricula of most
   computer science departments. This paper presents an observational
   study on students' ability to understand and apply design patterns.
   Within the context of a postgraduate software engineering course,
   students had to deliver two versions of a software system; one without
   and one with design patterns. The former served as a poorly designed
   system suffering from architectural problems, while the latter served
   as an improved system where design problems had been solved by
   appropriate patterns. The experiment allowed the quantitative
   evaluation of students' preference to patterns. Moreover, it was
   possible to assess students' ability in relating design problems with
   patterns and interpreting the impact of patterns on software metrics.
   The overall goal was to empirically identify ways in which a course on
   design patterns could be improved. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Special classes of asynchronous c-learning systems are the intelligent
   tutoring systems which represent an advanced learning and teaching
   environment adaptable to individual student's characteristics.
   Authoring shells have an environment that enables development of the
   intelligent tutoring systems. In this paper we present, in entirety,
   for the first time, our approach to research, development and
   implementation related to intelligent tutoring systems and ITS
   authoring shells. Our research relies on the traditional intelligent
   tutoring system, the consideration that teaching is control of learning
   and principles of good human tutoring in order to develop the
   Tutor-Expert System model for building intelligent tutoring systems in
   freely chosen domain knowledge. In this way we can wrap up an ongoing
   process that has lasted for the previous fifteen years. Prototype tests
   with the implemented systems have been carried out with students from a
   primary education to an academic level. Results of those tests are
   advantageous, according to surveys, and the implemented and deployed
   software satisfies functionalities and actors' demands. (c) 2007

AB Grid computing environments with abundant resources can support
   innovative e-Learning applications, and are promising platforms for
   e-Learning. To support individualized and adaptive learning, teachers
   are encouraged to develop various teaching materials according to
   different requirements. However, traditional methodologies for
   designing teaching materials are time-consuming. To speed up the
   development process of teaching materials, our idea is to use a rapid
   prototyping approach which is based on automatic draft generation and
   Wiki-based revision. This paper presents the approach named WARP
   (Wiki-based Authoring by Rapid Prototyping), which is composed of five
   phases: (1) requirement verification, (2) query expansion, (3)
   teaching-material retrieval, (4) draft generation and (5) Wiki-based
   revision. A prototype system was implemented in grid environments. The
   evaluation was conducted using a two-group t-test design. Experimental
   results indicate that teaching materials can be rapidly generated with
   the proposed approach. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The national certification tests and entrance examinations are the most
   important tests for proving the ability or knowledge level of a person.
   To accurately evaluate the professional skills or knowledge level, the
   composed test sheets must meet multiple assessment criteria such as the
   ratio of relevant concepts to be evaluated and the estimated testing
   time. Furthermore, to fairly compare the knowledge levels of the
   persons who receive different national tests and to avoid unexpected
   situations due to weather, accidents, etc., a set of parallel test
   sheets with identical test ability need to be composed, which is almost
   impossible to be accomplished manually. To cope with this problem, an
   innovative approach is proposed to efficiently compositing parallel
   test sheets from very large item banks, while meeting multiple
   assessment criteria. Moreover, a computer-assisted testing system was
   developed and a series of experiments were conducted to show the
   efficiency and effectiveness of the innovative approach. (c) 2007

AB Based on an account of how two classes of primary five students in
   Singapore engage in the learning of English, Mathematics and Science by
   playing the role of global citizens, the paper suggests an alternative
   but realistic approach to teaching global citizenship education. Set
   against the back story of Atlantis facing ecological, social and
   cultural decay due to the blind pursuit of prosperity and modernisation
   by its rulers, each student became a quester called on to save
   Atlantis. Throughout the mission they were presented with different
   problems in Atlantis (similar to existing global issues) and were
   expected to research and suggest solutions to the problems by alone or
   with fellow questers. These problems were tied to the primary five
   English, Mathematics and Science curriculum. Through documenting and
   making sense of these activities via observations, interviews and
   pre-post questionnaire surveys, the paper shows how the new approach
   may enhance the learning engagement, academic motivation and social
   commitments among the students. We also explore the sustainability and
   scalability of such an approach in the school system and highlight
   constraints. The paper then draws implications for global citizenship
   education in schools that include designing a meaningful context for
   engaged learning in schools with components of global citizenship,
   developing a research culture in schools as a stepping stone for global
   citizenship education and building capacity of teachers and school
   leaders in global citizenship. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This study focuses on how students in vocational high schools and
   universities interpret the algorithms in structural computer
   programming that concerns time-efficiency. The targeted research group
   consisted of 242 students from two vocational high schools and two
   departments of the Faculty of Education in Istanbul. This study used
   qualitative and quantitative research methods together. During the
   study the students were asked to evaluate the algorithms given to them
   in terms of their run-time efficiency. The analysis of the data has
   used descriptive statistics and the results of the independent sample
   T-tests to compare the groups. The findings of this study slightly
   stress that the students have misconceptions about algorithms. Students
   in high schools and in computer education and instructional education
   departments have the same observed misconceptions, while mathematics
   education students are better at interpreting the misconceptions. (c)

AB In this study we use a model which we refer to as the
   'teacher-technology environment interaction model' to explore the issue
   of the stress experienced by teachers whilst using ICT in the
   classroom. The methodology we used involved a comparison of three
   datasets obtained from: direct observation and video-logging of the
   teachers in the classroom; recordings of their galvanic skin response
   (GSR) taken whilst teaching; and interviews. Data were obtained from
   nine teachers, and in total, approximately 32 h of teaching activities
   were observed. The main results of this study were (a) the
   demonstration that teachers do suffer stress associated with the use of
   technology in the classroom (i.e. technostress) (b) the identification
   of causes, symptoms and coping strategies associated with technostress
   in the classroom. This study, therefore, points to an alternative way
   of thinking about the problems of implementing e-learning by
   conceptualizing some of these implementation problems in terms of
   technostress (and in particular of teacher-technology environment fit).

   postings. To explore the extent to which student participation in an
   online discussion forum is successful, we looked at the depth of
   discussion threads. We deemed a student facilitator to have
   successfully attracted other students to participant if the discussion
   threads had a depth of six or more levels of students' postings. We
   then examined in detail and reported the facilitation techniques that
   were exhibited by the student facilitators. Results showed that seven
   facilitation techniques were employed; the most frequently used were
   Socratic questioning and sharing personal opinions or experiences. We
   end by exploring potential implications for practice and for future
   research. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present the Intelligent Thai text - Thai sign translation for
   language learning ((ITSTL)-S-3). (ITSTL)-S-3 is able to translate Thai
   text into Thai sign language simply and conveniently anytime, anywhere.
   Thai sign language is the language of the deaf in Thailand. In the
   translation process, the distinction between Thai text and Thai sign
   language in both grammar and vocabulary are concerned in each
   processing step to ensure the accuracy of translation. (ITSTL)-S-3 was
   designed not only to be an automatic interpreter but also to be a
   language tutor assistant. It provides meaning of each word and
   describes the structure formation and word order of the translated
   sentence. With (ITSTL)-S-3, the deaf and hearing-impaired are able to
   enhance their communication ability and to improve their knowledge and
   learning skills. Moreover (ITSTL)-S-3 has increased motivation and
   opportunity for them to access multimedia and e-learning.
   In our initial experiment, (ITSTL)-S-3 was implemented to translate
   sentences/phrases which were collected from different sources including
   textbooks, cartoons, bedtime story, newspapers and the public labels.
   IT 3 STL was tested and evaluated in terms of the translation accuracy
   and user satisfaction. The evaluation results show that the translation
   accuracy and sign representation are acceptable, and it satisfies the
   users' needs. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study reported an investigation of eighth graders' (14-year-olds)
   web searching strategies and outcomes, and then analyzed their
   correlations with students' web experiences, epistemological beliefs,
   and the nature of searching tasks. Eighty-seven eighth graders were
   asked to fill out a questionnaire for probing epistemological beliefs
   (from positivist to constructivist-oriented views) and finished three
   different types of searching tasks. Their searching process was
   recorded by screen capture software and answers were reviewed by two
   expert teachers based on their accuracy, richness and soundness. Five
   quantitative indicators were used to assess students' searching
   strategies: number of keywords, visited pages, maximum depth of
   exploration, refinement of keyword, and number of words used in the
   first keyword. The main findings derived from this study suggested
   that, students with richer web experiences could find more correct
   answers in "close-ended" search tasks. In addition, students with
   better metacognitive skills such as keyword refinement tended to
   achieve more successful searching outcomes in such tasks. However, in
   "open-ended" tasks, where questions were less certain and answers were
   more elaborated, students who had more advanced epistemological
   beliefs, concurring with a constructivist view, had better searching
   outcomes in terms of their soundness and richness. This study has
   concluded that epistemological beliefs play an influential role in
   open-ended Internet learning environments. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

TI Identifying students' mathematical skills from a multiple-choice
   diagnostic test using an iterative technique to minimise false positives
SO COMPUTERS & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE intelligent tutoring systems; post-secondary education; interactive
   learning environments; applications in subject areas
AB There is anecdotal evidence that a significant number of students
   studying computing related courses at degree level have difficulty with
   sub-GCE mathematics. Testing of students' skills is often performed
   using diagnostic tests and a number of computer-based diagnostic tests
   exist, which work, essentially, by testing one specific diagnostic
   skill at a time.
   This paper proposes using a multiple-choice computer-based diagnostic
   test where each question has a number of diagnostic skills associated
   with it in order to allow more flexible questions. A simple measure of
   a diagnostic skill's competency could be obtained by calculating the
   number of questions answered correctly, divided by the total number of
   questions, associated with that skill. However, because a question may
   have many skills associated with it, if a question is wrong, then each
   skill is deemed to be problematic, even though there may not be a
   problem with all skills.
   A technique has been developed that refines the initial skill
   competencies and iteratively re-calculates the skills based on all
   other competencies. Pilots of the new diagnostic test with first year
   computing students indicate that particular mathematical problems exist
   for many students, and suggest that the iterative algorithm produces a
   more precise indication of competencies than a simple competence
   measure approach. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Distance learning is different from regular learning in the classroom.
   One of the main factors which influence the effectiveness of the
   learning process is the interaction that exists between the teacher and
   the student. Our research indicates that different interactions have
   different effects.
   There are two methods used for implementing distance learning systems,
   i.e. synchronous and asynchronous. Our research is based on the model
   developed by Oliver and McLaughlin. According to this model, there
   exist five types of teacher-student interactions: social, procedural,
   expository, explanatory and cognitive. The present study refers to the
   cognitive interaction and differentiates between surface processes and
   deep processes.
   The study presents different variables and their influences on the
   students' achievements and their satisfaction from learning via a
   synchronous versus an asynchronous distance learning system. The
   interaction level between the students and the teacher and among the
   students was found to be a significant factor in determining the
   effectiveness of the teaching method. The observations and interviews
   which we held with the students helped clarify the information that was
   obtained using the quantitative research tools, and showed that the
   presence of a teacher-student interaction which accompanies the
   learning process is very important for all learners. However, students
   with high-level thinking can overcome the low-level of interactions in
   asynchronous learning. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB How do we know when an educational organization, process, or courseware
   tool is innovative? How do we define the processes that encourage
   change or the ways in which faculty develop new courseware innovations?
   The terms innovation, change, and development have been overused in so
   many contexts that they now seem to have lost their meanings. A review
   of the literature on innovation and educational change offered no
   agreed up definitions or models. Prior studies that have considered
   innovations in educational technology have focused on the innovations
   themselves or the potential barriers to faculty adoptions of externally
   developed innovations. In this study of an educational technology
   services program that provides competitive grants for faculty-developed
   technology courseware projects at a large state research university, I
   shifted the focus to consider: what current and future higher education
   faculty consider to be an innovative courseware project, and how they
   conceive of processes for developing such innovations. Results
   suggested that when it is not reduced to a rhetorical device in a
   marketing campaign or department instructional technology vision plan,
   innovation that is defined locally by a community of practice can
   effectively transform teaching, learning, and the organizations that
   support these activities. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Virtually errorless high speed data processing feature has made
   computers popular assessment tools in education. An important concern
   in developing countries considering integrating computers as an
   educational assessment tool before making substantial investment is the
   effects of computer-based testing on students' test scores as compared
   to paper-and-pencil tests. This study investigated whether test scores
   of Turkish students were different in the computer-based test and in
   the paper-and-pencil test, with forty-seven undergraduate students
   studying at a public university located in the Blacksea region of
   Turkey. Findings of this study showed that test scores of undergraduate
   students were not different in the computer-based test and in the
   paper-and-pencil test which led us to reach the conclusion that
   computer-based testing can be considered as a promising alternative
   technique for the undergraduate students in Turkey. (c) 2007 Elsevier

AB Mobile synchronous learning is a new challenge in the e-learning
   domain. While popular mobile communication devices, such as cell
   phones, cannot directly accommodate traditional synchronous content due
   to the major limitation of display size, other constraints also
   restrict convenient interactions while using mobile devices in a
   synchronous learning environment. These problems have motivated the
   authors of this study to design a context-awareness synchronous
   learning system and to develop a corresponding pedagogical framework.
   Different than existing synchronous learning strategies, the proposed
   system enhances the feedback mechanism and implements an enhanced model
   for achieving mobile interaction in a synchronous learning environment.
   The enhanced model is named Interactive Service Module, which enables
   interactions between teachers and students via short message delivery.
   In the proposed synchronous learning environment, different kinds of
   learning devices are used to access the same source of synchronous
   content simultaneously. To accommodate the diversity of devices,
   several content styles have been developed and an appropriate style can
   be selected to a learner via a decision mechanism. This mechanism is
   based on fuzzy weighted average technique to measure the average
   computational power for each device. Finally, questionnaires were used
   to evaluate the usability of the proposed synchronous learning
   environment, and the results indicate that our system can facilitate
   synchronous learning by enabling students to access lessons
   conveniently and efficiently from a wide variety of locations, using
   common mobile communication devices. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Policies and programs focused on using ePortfolios to support lifelong
   and lifewide learning should be informed by research. This article
   presents the results from research on eFolio, Minnesota, a project that
   makes ePortfolio software available to all residents of the State of
   Minnesota in the United States. The most active portfolio authors of
   all ages are using eFolio for a wide range of interconnected purposes,
   with educational planning at the center, over time in multiple roles as
   students, educators, and workers. In the process of composing a
   portfolio, the authors who say eFolio has had a highly significant
   impact on their learning move from an experimental stage into a living
   document stage. In this second stage, authors are likely to have a
   strong sense of and connection to audience, real and imagined, and to
   see their portfolios as having integrity, as being faithful
   representations of their lives across roles and over time. Portfolio
   projects committed to supporting learning throughout life should enable
   access, foreground planning, promote findability, cultivate audiences,
   capture activity, enable layering, foreground the personal, cultivate
   collaborative contexts, and promote integral introductions. (c) 2007

AB This research aims to develop a multiple-choice Web-based
   quiz-game-like formative assessment system, named GAM-WATA. The unique
   design of 'Ask-Hint Strategy' turns the Web-based formative assessment
   into an online quiz game. 'Ask-Hint Strategy' is composed of 'Prune
   Strategy' and 'Call-in Strategy'. 'Prune Strategy' removes one
   incorrect option and turns the original 4-option item into a 3-option
   one. 'Call-in Strategy' provides the rate at which other test takers
   choose each option when answering a question. This research also
   compares the effectiveness of three different types of formative
   assessment in an e-Learning environment: paper-and-pencil test (PPT),
   normal Web-based test (N-WBT) and GAM-WATA. In total, 165 fifth grade
   elementary students (from six classes) in central Taiwan participated
   in this research. The six classes of students were then divided into
   three groups and each group was randomly assigned one type of formative
   assessment. Overall results indicate that different types of formative
   assessment have significant impacts on e-Learning effectiveness and
   that the e-Learning effectiveness of the students in the GAM-WATA group
   appears to be better. Students in the GAM-WATA group more actively
   participate in Web-based formative assessment to do self-assessment
   than students in the N-WBT group. The effectiveness of formative
   assessment will not be significantly improved only by replacing the
   paper-and-pencil test with Web-based test. The strategies included in
   GAM-WATA are recommended to be taken into consideration when
   researchers design Web-based formative assessment systems in the
   future. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID WORK
AB The purpose of the present study was to examine the network structure
   of a teacher community in relation to their use of information and
   communication technology (ICT). The participants in the study were the
   33 members of the teacher community of an upper comprehensive school
   from a suburban area of Helsinki, Finland. The methodology of the study
   was social network analysis. The participants were asked to assess
   their networking relations according to the following five dimensions:
   (1) providing technical advice regarding ICT, (2) providing pedagogical
   advice for using ICT, (3) collaboration regarding web-based learning,
   (4) acquiring new knowledge or ideas of web-based learning, and (5)
   informal interaction between the members of the community. The results
   indicated that there were a few central actors in the community who
   dominated technical and pedagogical knowledge exchange and to whom
   their colleagues actively turned when seeking advice. Two of the
   cognitively central actors represented hybrid expertise, a
   characteristic of which was to merge technological and pedagogical
   expertise in using ICT in education. These actors also tended to have
   their own external networking relations that helped them keep up their
   high level of competence. The participants' ICT-related egocentric
   networks differed in size and density. There were some actors central
   in the network of informal interaction that were, simultaneously,
   peripheral in ICT-related networking activities. On the other hand, the
   central actors of ICT were not necessarily the socially central persons
   in the community. Four patterns of networking were identified in the
   analysis; The Counsellor offers advice actively without seeking
   information herself from colleagues; The Inquirer is an active seeker
   of ICT-related information capitalizing on her social relations; The
   Collaborator engages in collaborative efforts of web-based learning by
   using several media; and The Weakly Social prefers media rather than
   face-to-face contacts in his information seeking. (c) 2008 Elsevier

TI An algorithm for automatic checking of exercises in a dynamic geometry
   system: iGeom
SO COMPUTERS & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article

   geometry; iGeom
AB One of the key issues in e-learning environments is the possibility of
   creating and evaluating exercises. However, the lack of tools
   supporting the authoring and automatic checking of exercises for
   specifics topics (e.g., geometry) drastically reduces advantages in the
   use of e-learning environments on a larger scale, as usually happens in
   Brazil. This paper describes an algorithm, and a tool based on it,
   designed for the authoring and automatic checking of geometry
   exercises. The algorithm dynamically compares the distances between the
   geometric objects of the student's solution and the template's
   solution, provided by the author of the exercise. Each solution is a
   geometric construction which is considered a function receiving
   geometric objects (input) and returning other geometric objects
   (output). Thus, for a given problem, if we know one function
   (construction) that solves the problem, we can compare it to any other
   function to check whether they are equivalent or not. Two functions are
   equivalent if, and only if, they have the same output when the same
   input is applied. If the student's solution is equivalent to the
   template's solution, then we consider the student's solution as a
   correct solution. Our software utility provides both authoring and
   checking tools to work directly on the Internet, together with learning
   management systems. These tools are implemented using the dynamic
   geometry software, iGeom, which has been used in a geometry course
   since 2004 and has a successful track record in the classroom.
   Empowered with these new features, iGeom simplifies teachers' tasks,
   solves non-trivial problems in student solutions and helps to increase
   student motivation by providing feedback in real time. (c) 2008

AB The purpose of this study was to examine individual differences in the
   effectiveness of learning objects in secondary school classrooms.
   Specifically, gender, age, grade, subject area, and computer comfort
   (self-efficacy) were examined in 850 students. Effectiveness was
   measured in terms of student attitude (learning, quality, and
   engagement) and student performance. No gender differences were
   observed between males and females with respect to student attitudes or
   performance. Age was significantly correlated with student attitudes
   and performance, however correlation coefficients were small. Grade 12
   students were more positive about learning objects and performed better
   than grade 9 and 10 students. Science students had significantly more
   positive attitudes and performed better than mathematics students.
   Finally, students who were more comfortable about computers,
   appreciated learning objects more than their less confident peers,
   however performance was unaffected. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published

   interaction; improving classroom teaching; interactive learning

AB There has been extensive investment by governments and individual
   schools in interactive whiteboard technology in developed countries
   premised on the assumption that their use in education will impact
   positively on learners' achievements. Developing countries, such as
   South Africa, keen to raise attainment among their learners are
   following suit. While at least one of the nine provinces in South
   Africa had undertaken pilot roll-outs of interactive whiteboards (IWBs)
   in schools, the Eastern Cape Department of Education commissioned a
   feasibility study to determine teachers and learners perceptions of the
   potential benefits and drawbacks of using interactive pen technology,
   specifically the eBeam, in their teaching and learning environments,
   before embarking upon a large scale roll-out. This paper reports on a
   case study of three government schools and highlights the learners and
   teachers' enthusiasm about the "big screen" and the multimedia options,
   but also raises concerns about the lack of ICT literacy displayed by
   teachers and learners and the cost of technology. As most of the
   benefits mentioned by the teachers and learners seemed to accrue to the
   use of the laptop and data projector combination and most of the
   drawbacks emanated from the use of the interactive pen technology
   itself, we suggest that it may not be expeditious to attempt to
   "leap-frog" the use of interactive technologies. Instead we suggest
   that an evolution of ICT related pedagogy is necessary to make optimal
   use of interactive pen technologies such as the eBeam and that teachers
   should be offered technologies, not have them imposed upon them. (c)

AB Many educators have attempted to implement a blog in educational
   contexts to enhance the communication environment among students and
   teachers. However, it is uncertain as to why traditional
   computer-mediated communication (CMC) applications should be replaced
   with blogs. It is time to comprehensively explore the effects of
   educational blogs by considering the CMC tools. This paper reviews
   prior studies and develops a model for the use of blogs in educational
   contexts by taking into account socio-teclinical systems theory. The
   model contributes to interactivity, an open system, a visualization
   tool, and a decentralized environment of online communication
   circumstance. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There has been a recent call for the use of more systematic thought
   experiments when investigating learning. This paper presents a
   storyboarding method for capturing and sharing initial ideas and their
   evolution in the design of a mathematics learning task. The storyboards
   produced can be considered as "virtual data" created by thought
   experiments that provided an audit trail of evolving design ideas and
   enabled peer feedback to be sought. The outcomes were a diagnostic
   computer-based task for investigating mathematical thinking and the
   development and analysis of the storyboarding method itself. It is
   argued that storyboarding offers an opportunity for systematising
   thought experiments and peer feedback towards more robust learning task
   designs and theoretical conjectures. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This study evaluated the performance of university students who learned
   science texts by using, information communication technologies (ICT)
   including animation, static figures, power point, and e-plus software.
   The characteristics of students and their achievements and attitudes
   toward 11 multimedia science courses were analyzed. The 11 samples in
   this study included 676 undergraduate students who took science courses
   during the 2005 academic year. The results included the computation of
   the F-ratio, p-values, and Cohen's effect-sizes of attitudes toward
   science and learning science in relation to the student's gender,
   attendance of computer orientation classes, use of computer-multimedia,
   disposition toward computers, and majors. Our study describes some
   helpful approaches to the incorporation of computer-based multimedia
   teaching utilizing constructivist design principles to facilitate the
   student's understanding and attitude toward science learning. (c) 2008

AB The aim of the present research was to examine the relationship between
   Greek young people aged 12-18 and the Internet through their patterns
   of Internet use in the home. A particular objective of the study was
   the investigation of the possible effects of social stratification,
   gender and age on their domestic Internet use. A sample of 418 high
   school students selected from 17 schools in four Greek cities completed
   a structured self-reported questionnaire primarily concerned with
   Internet use (frequency, purpose and behaviour patterns) at home and
   the types of the parental supervision. The research was carried out
   during the period 2004-2005. The main findings of the study were the
   following: (a) Internet access remains at a very low level and is
   insufficiently used for school purposes, (b) younger students (aged
   12-15 years) use it more frequently than older ones for information
   seeking concerning school work, (c) the Internet is an indicator of
   social and economic stratification since most young people with access
   to it come from family environments with a higher educational and
   socioeconomic background and live in urban and semi urban areas, (d)
   boys make up the majority of systematic users, mainly for entertainment
   purposes, (e) the Internet is a place and space safeguarding the
   "privacy" of young people with the majority of them preferring to surf
   alone, (f) parental supervision and monitoring seems to be absent
   largely from the relationship between youth and the Internet, and (g)
   in general, the frequency and type of Internet use are not
   significantly affected by students' places of residence or the
   educational level and profession of their parents. (c) 2008 Elsevier

AB In this study, we examined relations between outside school computer
   experiences, perceived social support for using computers, and
   self-efficacy and value beliefs about computer learning for 340 Greek
   elementary school boys and girls. Participants responded to a
   questionnaire about their access to computer use outside school (e.g.
   frequency of use and nature of activities), perceived parental and peer
   support, and computer self-efficacy and value beliefs. Although almost
   all students used computers outside school, there were significant
   gender differences in frequency and type of computer use. Also, boys
   reported more perceived support from their parents and peers to use
   computers and more positive computer self-efficacy and value beliefs
   than girls. Parental support and, to a lesser extent, peer support were
   the factors more strongly associated with boys' and girls' computer
   self-efficacy and value beliefs, while home computer access was not
   related to students' motivation. Our findings highlight the role of
   socialization in the gender gap in computing and the need for research
   and educational interventions that focus on the social practices that
   communicate gendered expectations to young boys and girls. (c) 2008

TI Rethinking lifelong learning through online distance learning in
   Chinese educational policies, practices and research
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper offers a critique of the Chinese philosophy of online
   distance learning as a means of building a lifelong learning society.
   Literature about lifelong learning and its implications for online
   distance learning is reviewed. Documents, reports and research papers
   are examined to explore the characteristics of the Chinese philosophy
   of online distance learning as reflected in the prevailing
   understanding and debates in the field. Phenomenological analysis,
   deconstructive discourse analysis and internal criticism are employed,
   guided by a phenomenological qualitative methodology. The critique
   reveals that the notion of lifelong learning is to some extent obscured
   in meaning in the prevailing understanding of and debates about Chinese
   online distance learning. Furthermore, it shows that the Chinese
   philosophy of online distance learning paradoxically combines a sense
   of overenthusiasm with a sense of underestimation associated with the
   potential of online distance learning in promoting lifelong learning.
   Also identified is the emerging development of Chinese online distance
   learning towards its 'in-depth development', based on an increasing
   awareness of the necessity to enhance the quality of online distance
   learning through integration of educational theories with information
   and communication technologies (ICT). The paper calls for a new vision
   on ICT for learning as a necessary condition for successful
   incorporation of Chinese online distance learning with and into
   lifelong learning.

TI Institutional perspectives: The challenges of e-learning diffusion
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB There has been significant recent interest in the dynamics of
   institutional change and e-learning. This paper reports on the findings
   from a series of discussions about e-learning diffusion held with
   institutional e-learning representatives from across the globe. In the
   course of discussion it became clear that in some institutions
   e-learning was an accepted part of everyday activity, while in others
   it struggled to gain traction. There were identifiable common elements
   in those institutions that had appeared to have successfully engaged
   with e-learning across their teaching and learning functions. The
   findings of this exploratory study indicate that institutions have
   either achieved a state of sustainable embedding for e-learning, or
   else need to. Unless a state of institutional sustainability is
   achieved, it is likely that e-learning activity will in the long term
   be limited to enthusiasts.

TI The tortoise and the hare enigma in e-transformation in Japanese and
   Korean higher education
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Japan and Korea have highly developed information and communications
   technology infrastructures and have recently reformed their higher
   education systems and encouraged e-transformation. However, Japanese
   universities have not embraced e-learning as wholeheartedly as their
   Korean counterparts. The paper concludes that this is due to
   governmental and institutional failure to develop a cogent vision and
   strategic plan for e-learning, to recognise the need for fundamental
   shifts in organisational cultures and structures and pedagogy and to
   provide training, funding, recognition and reward for such development.
   It attributes this to differences in the cultural perspectives, values
   and customs of the two countries' policy makers, managers and faculty
   members. The findings are seen to hold important lessons for other
   countries embarking on e-transformation.

TI Examining barriers in technology-enhanced problem-based learning: Using
   a performance support systems approach
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTS
AB This study focused on the barriers that middle school teachers faced
   when implementing technology-enhanced problem-based learning (PBL) in
   their classrooms. Using a human performance-based model, we interviewed
   teachers, administrators, university faculty and technical support
   staff to determine the perceived importance of multiple barriers to the
   implementation of technology-enhanced PBL. Twenty-one teachers, two
   school administrators and a project manager, two faculty members, and
   two technical support staff participated in the study. Interview data
   were supported by surveys, classroom observations and researchers'
   reflective journals. Results suggested that lack of a clear, shared
   vision was the primary barrier. Additional barriers included lack of
   knowledge and skills, unclear expectations and insufficient feedback.
   Recommendations to support teachers' efforts to integrate
   technology-enhanced problem-based learning are presented.

TI A comparison of electronic and paper-based assignment submission and
   feedback
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents the results of a study evaluating student
   perceptions of online assignment submission. 47 students submitted
   assignments and received feedback via features within the Virtual
   Learning Environment Blackboard (TM). The students then completed
   questionnaires comparing their experience of online submission and
   feedback with traditional methods.
   Results indicated that 88% of students reported a time saving and many
   reported financial benefits using online submission. 93% of students
   preferred having their feedback available online rather than printed
   and handed to them. Overall, students preferred online assignment
   management to postal or physical hand-in. The main disadvantage of
   electronic submission appeared to be student distrust of the receipt
   system.
   The use of online assignment submission and management is recommended
   for use in Higher Education establishments where students may be
   remote. It is most suitable for assignments that do not require
   inclusion of many images.

TI The effects of active versus reflective learning style on the processes

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID DECISION-MAKING; DISCUSSIONS; PATTERNS
AB This study examined how message-response exchanges produced in the
   interactions between active learners only, reflective learners only,
   active-reflective learners and reflective-active learners affected how
   often active versus reflective learners posted rebuttals to arguments
   and challenges across four types of exchanges that believed to promote
   critical discourse (argument-challenge, challenge-counterchallenge,
   challenge-explain, challenge-evidence) in computer-supported
   collaborative argumentation (CSCA). This study found that the exchanges
   between reflective learners produced 44% more responses than in the
   exchanges between active learners (ES = +0.17). The
   reflective-reflective exchanges produced 47% more responses than the
   active-reflective exchanges (ES = +0.18). These results suggest that
   groups with reflective learners only are likely to produce more
   critical discourse than groups with active learners only, and the ratio
   of active-reflective learners within a group can potentially influence
   overall group performance. These findings illustrate how specific
   traits of the learner can affect discourse processes in CSCA and
   provide insights into process-oriented strategies and tools for
   structuring dialogue and promoting critical inquiry in online
   discussions.

ID BACCALAUREATE NURSING PROGRAM; STUDENTS
AB The purpose of this study was to investigate (1) the relationship
   between critical thinking skills (CTS) and critical thinking
   dispositions (CTD), and (2) the effectiveness of different levels of
   instructional strategy (asynchronous online discussions (AODs), CTS
   instruction via AODs, and CTS instruction with CTD cultivation via
   AODs) in improving students' CTS and CTD. A pretest and posttest
   quasi-experimental design was employed to achieve this purpose. The
   participants in this study were 220 students enrolled in a general
   education course at a large university in Taiwan. The findings of this
   study were as follows: (1) the overall relationship between CTS and CTD
   was positive. However, further analysis of the relationship between the
   different levels of CTS and CTD showed that only the students with high
   CTS and medium CTD showed a significant correlation; (2) the
   enhancement in CTS reinforced CTD, but the improvement in CTD did not
   increase the level of CTS. In addition, it is recommended that to
   improve the CTS and CTD of all students (including the students with a
   high level of CTS), the instructional strategy, CTS instruction with
   CTD cultivation, be employed.

AB This study empirically evaluates the technology acceptance model drawn
   from Information Systems (IS) literature to investigate how user
   beliefs and attitudes influence learning-object use among higher
   education learners by evaluating the relationships between perceived
   usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude, behavioural intentions and
   actual use. In the study, 601 potential learning-object users were
   presented with an introductory demonstration of learning objects for a
   Digital Systems course. Following the demonstration and practice, data
   on user beliefs, attitudes and intention to use learning objects were
   gathered, while data on actual use of learning objects was collected at
   the end of the semester. Subjects with prior experience using the
   learning objects were eliminated from further analysis, resulting in a
   final sample of 481 users. structural equation modelling was employed
   to test the hypothesised study model. The analysis showed that both the
   user beliefs and attitudes have significant positive relationships with
   behavioural intention and that behavioural intention accurately
   predicted the actual use of learning objects. The results extend the
   validity of the TAM into a learning object context and clearly pointed
   out that it can be used to predict users' future behaviour.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB An electronic portfolio system, designed to serve as a resource-based
   learning space, was tested in a fifth-grade science class. The
   control-group students accessed a traditional folder-based information
   display in the system and the experimental-group students accessed a
   concept map-based information display to review a science portfolio.
   The student-constructed science portfolio was a result of a collection
   of digital artefacts such as graphic images, instructional videos and
   textual files on terms and definitions relevant to the Earth's
   atmosphere. In the information-processing performance test, the
   experimental-group students scored significantly higher and spent much
   less time in finding answers to the questions presented. Also, in the
   3-day delayed memory retention tests, the experimental-group students
   achieved significantly higher scores. The multiple regression models
   confirm that the visualisation variation is the most significant
   predictor for student performance (ie, comprehension and access time).
   Also, the regression models suggest that language-arts proficiency may
   reduce overall system access time; while higher math proficiency may
   predict retention scores.

AB As other countries vigorously promote rapid advancement in science,
   optimizing the participation of all students in the United States in
   science is imperative. This study focused on African American students
   and examined their science achievement in relation to Black Cultural
   Ethos (BCE), a construct rooted in psychology. Via qualitative and
   quantitative data obtained from a non-random control group design, the
   study addressed three questions: (1) With respect to BCE, what
   characterizes the natural instructional contexts of two middle school
   science teachers? (2) What characterizes the achievement of African
   American students in contexts that incorporate BCE and contexts that do
   not? (3) What achievement patterns, if any, exist in BCE and non-BCE
   instructional contexts? With regard to the natural contexts, the
   teachers did not incorporate BCE even when the opportunities were
   available to do so. Within these non-BCE contexts, the group's mean
   scores on the study-specific test that aligned with instruction
   decreased from pretest to posttest with approximately one-third of the
   students' scores improving. When a context was altered with a moderate
   effect size of 0.47 to include BCE, the group's mean scores on the
   aforementioned test increased from pretest to posttest with two-thirds
   of the students' scores improving. An illustration of the interplay
   between BCE and context and a consideration of the interplay as a
   mediating factor in research involving African American students
   encapsulate the significance and implications of the study's findings.

AB The aim of this study was to understand the positional identity of
   three African American secondary science teachers. Positional identity
   was operationally defined in terms of race, ethnicity, economic status,
   gender, religion, and age. Positional identity was posited to inform
   why diverse teachers with differing knowledge and experiences in
   science exist. An analysis of the findings suggested that the teachers'
   positional identity was defined beyond race, ethnicity and gender.
   Although the three science teachers came from very similar social
   backgrounds and were members of the same racial/ethnic group (African
   American), their positionality manifested itself in different ways:
   meanings of their life experiences; orientations to professional
   development; and future career goals in science education. Thus they
   possessed multiple positional identities that intersected in various
   ways which resulted in them having different perceptions of the world
   and subjectivities as science teachers. Implications included
   addressing positional identity and the creation of professional
   development models that are framed around incorporating teacher
   identity in addition to furthering teachers' personal and professional
   advancement within science education. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Science achievement and self-concept are articulated in this study to
   examine a model of reciprocal relationship during a crosscultural
   transition. Trend data have been gathered to assess changes of the
   perceived English importance before and after Hong Kong's sovereignty
   handover from Britain to China. The data analyses were conducted four
   times across dimensions of gender and timing over which the political
   transition took place. Besides small gender differences in the
   statistical results, weak but significant reciprocal relationships have
   been found between science achievement and self-concept. In line with a
   policy of switching the medium of instruction from English to Chinese
   in most secondary schools, interpretation of different path
   coefficients obliges incorporation of cross-cultural understanding in
   science education. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study examined the impact of the 3-year implementation of a
   professional development intervention on science achievement of
   culturally and linguistically diverse elementary students. Teachers
   were provided with instructional units and workshops that were designed
   to improve teaching practices and foster positive beliefs about science
   and literacy with diverse student groups. The study involved third,
   fourth, and fifth grade students at six elementary schools in a large
   urban school district during the 2001 through 2004 school years.
   Significance tests of mean scores between pre- and posttests indicated
   statistically significant increases each year on all measures of
   science at all three grade levels. Achievement gaps among demographic
   subgroups sometimes narrowed among fourth grade students and remained
   consistent among third and fifth grade students. Item-by-item
   comparisons with NAEP and TIMSS samples indicated overall positive
   performance by students at the end of each school year. The consistent
   patterns of positive outcomes indicate the effectiveness of our
   intervention in producing achievement gains at all three grade levels
   while also reducing achievement gaps among demographic subgroups at the
   fourth grade. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study tracked the influence of explicit reflective instructional
   methods on cultural values, ethical and intellectual development, and
   the relationship of these with preservice teachers' views of nature of
   science (NOS). The researchers used the Views of Nature of Science Form
   B (VNOS B) to describe NOS views, the Learning Context Questionnaire
   (LCQ) to classify preservice teachers' ethical and intellectual
   positions using Perry's scheme, and the Schwartz Values Inventory (SVI)
   to measure preservice teachers' cultural values. The interventions took
   place in two concurrent courses: a science methods course, and a
   foundations of early childhood course. The science methods course
   explicitly emphasized NOS throughout the semester, and the foundations
   of early childhood course reinforced these ideas through cultural
   activities that stressed empirical evidence. Analysis of data showed
   relationships between preservice teachers' Perry positions and
   responses on the VNOS B with those at higher positions exhibiting more
   informed NOS views. Relationships between preservice teachers' NOS
   views and their cultural values were identified, such as those at the
   dualism position holding achievement more highly for scientists than
   those at other Perry positions. The values preservice teachers held
   personally were different from those they held as important for
   scientists. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Computer simulations and laboratory activities have been traditionally
   treated as substitute or competing methods in science teaching. The aim
   of this experimental study was to investigate if it would be more
   beneficial to combine simulation and laboratory activities than to use
   them separately in teaching the concepts of simple electricity. Based
   on their pre-test performances, 66 elementary school students were
   placed into three different learning environments: computer simulation,
   laboratory exercise and a simulation-laboratory combination. The
   results showed that the simulation-laboratory combination environment
   led to statistically greater learning gains than the use of either
   simulation or laboratory activities alone, and it also promoted
   students' conceptual understanding most efficiently. There were no
   statistical differences between simulation and laboratory environments.
   The results highlight the benefits of using simulation along with
   hands-on laboratory activities to promote students' understanding of
   electricity. A simulation can help students to first understand the
   theoretical principles of electricity; however, in order to promote
   conceptual change, it is necessary to challenge further students'
   intuitive conceptions by demonstrating through testing that the laws
   and principles that are discovered through a simulation also apply in
   reality.

DE evaluation criteria; factor analysis; learning management systems;

AB This study aims to validate a model for evaluating learning management
   systems (LMS) used in e-learning fields. A survey of 163 e-learning
   experts, regarding 81 validation items developed through literature
   review, was used to ascertain the importance of the criteria. A concise
   list of explanatory constructs, including two principle factors, was
   extracted from the responses of 133 respondents by exploratory factor
   analysis. Factor I was labeled as 'instruction management, screen
   design, and technology' and factor II, 'interaction and evaluation'.
   Factors I and II consisted of four and three sub-factors, respectively.
   Confirmatory factor analysis, in turn, was carried out to assess the
   degree to which the plausibility of factor models was empirically
   confirmed. Overall fit measures (RMSEA, CFI, NNFI indexes) showed the
   model to be quite suitable for LMS evaluation. Reliability estimates
   using Cronbach's alpha indicated that the evaluation tool had good
   internal consistency. The overall results of the analyses suggest that
   this evaluation tool is highly instrumental for LMS.

TI WebQuests as perceived by teachers: implications for online teaching

DT Article
DE collaboration; constructivist; guided discovery; hypermedia; problem

AB The WebQuest as an instructional tool has recently been widely adopted
   in K-16 education. However, its underlying principles and functionality
   are not well understood, which has resulted in an inconsistency in
   practice. This study identifies the underlying constructs of WebQuests
   as perceived by teachers and variables affecting their perceptions on
   WebQuests. A survey was conducted on teachers (n = 226) recruited from
   one large research university in the USA and a professional listserv.
   The findings reveal three constructs perceived by teachers as critical
   to WebQuests: constructivist problem solving, social interaction and
   scaffolded learning. Results also show that variables like purpose of
   WebQuest use, years of teaching, years of WebQuest use and gender
   predict, at various degrees, teachers' perceptions on WebQuests.
   Discussions are made on how the constructs identified can be used to
   improve online teaching and learning. Suggestions for future study are
   included by examining the influences of social, psychological and
   affective factors on learners' learning in WebQuests.

   Web-based courses
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING

ID NETWORKS
AB Students acquire and process information in different ways depending on
   their learning styles. To be effective, Web-based courses should
   guarantee that all the students learn despite their different learning
   styles. To achieve this goal, we have to detect how students learn:
   reflecting or acting; steadily or in fits and starts; intuitively or
   sensitively. In a previous work, we have presented an approach that
   uses Bayesian networks to detect a student's learning style in
   Web-based courses. In this work, we present an enhanced Bayesian model
   designed after the analysis of the results obtained when evaluating the
   approach in the context of an Artificial Intelligence course. We
   evaluated the precision of our Bayesian approach to infer students'
   learning styles from the observation of their actions with a Web-based
   education system during three semesters. We show how the results from
   one semester enabled us to adjust our initial model and helped teachers
   improve the content of the course for the following semester, enhancing
   in this way students' learning process. We obtained higher precision
   values when inferring the learning styles with the enhanced model.

AB Learning from worked-out examples has been shown to be very effective
   in initial cognitive skill acquisition. In order to fully exploit the
   potential of example-based learning, teachers should, however, know how
   to effectively employ such examples in classroom instruction.
   Therefore, we have designed a computer-based learning environment in
   which mathematics and science teachers learn how to effectively employ
   worked-out examples. The learning environment was developed according
   to approved design criteria. The topics that are addressed in the
   learning environment were chosen in response to the results of a needs
   assessment that analysed schoolbooks and classroom videos, and took
   interviews with teachers into account. In experiments as well as in
   several teacher trainings on example-based learning, the computer-based
   learning environment was evaluated and improved accordingly. On a more
   general level, our research and development project showed that a
   computer-based learning programme could be a sensible tool that
   supports follow-up work in teacher training contexts.

   object repositories (LORs); phenomenography; socio-cultural issues in
   technology use
AB Globally, institutions are setting up digital repositories to support
   the sharing of resources for teaching and learning. The educational
   rationale is that a single set of resources can be restructured to
   support different pedagogical approaches and to achieve economies of
   scale. A key problem is that these learning object repositories (LORs),
   like many other learning technology innovations, are often designed to
   exploit the capabilities of technology rather than to meet learners'
   needs. The premise of this study is that the nature and organization of
   a community is likely to impact the way an LOR is used. Key dimensions
   of repositories and communities are discussed. Three repository systems
   are analysed to identify how communities use repositories. Guided by
   Activity Theory, the LORs and user communities are analysed as activity
   systems. These activity systems are compared and contradictions between
   them are identified. From the analysis, barriers and enablers for the
   use of LORs to support learning are discussed and a framework for
   addressing the key issues in the repository development stage is
   proposed.

TI Using the interactive whiteboard to resource continuity and support
   multimodal teaching in a primary science classroom
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE case study; interactive whiteboard; mediated; multimedia; primary;
   qualitative
AB All communication is inherently multimodal, and understandings of
   science need to be multidimensional. The interactive whiteboard offers
   a range of potential benefits to the primary science classroom in terms
   of relative ease of integration of a number of presentational and ICT
   functions, which, taken together, offers new opportunities for
   fostering multifaceted pedagogic strategies. In this case study, we
   examine in detail how a teacher pursues two themes across four science
   lessons. We examine how the teacher creates continuity in her students'
   learning experiences through taking up some of the affordances of the
   IWB in order to represent scientific phenomena and engage children in
   activities to consolidate their understandings. Support is offered for
   the notion that while pedagogic goals and strategies must determine the
   selection of tools, rather than the 'tail wagging the dog' as in
   technology-focussed hyperbole, planned use of the interactive
   whiteboard, conceptualized as a 'heterogeneous mediational tool kit'
   (Wertsch 1991), can be effectively integrated into teaching practice.

TI Comparison of curricular breadth, depth, and recurrence and physics
   achievement of TIMSS Population 3 countries
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

DT Article
ID SCIENCE-EDUCATION
AB This study is a secondary analysis of data from the 1995 administration
   of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). The
   purpose is to compare the breadth, depth, and recurrence of the typical
   physics curriculum in the United States with the typical curricula in
   different countries and to determine whether there are associations
   between these three curricular constructs and physics achievement. The
   first data analysis consisted of descriptive statistics (means,
   standard deviations, and standardized scores) for each of the three
   curricular variables. This analysis was used to compare the curricular
   profile in physics of the United States with the profiles of the other
   countries in the sample. The second data analysis consisted of
   correlations relating the three curricular variables with achievement.
   The results show that the U.S. curriculum has low breadth, low depth,
   and high recurrence. The U.S. curricular profile was also unique when
   compared with the profiles of the other countries in the sample. The
   only statistically significant correlation is between achievement and
   depth. Depth of curriculum is the only curricular variable that is
   closely related to physics achievement, so the U.S. physics curriculum
   should add depth. It is also possible that the entire U.S. profile
   needs to be changed. Further study is needed in this area including
   more research that is empirical, studies that cover the entire
   curriculum rather than just single courses or disciplines, and studies
   comparing curricula within the United States.

ID YOUNG-CHILDREN; MENTAL MODELS; SCIENCE TEXT; SIMILARITY; BEHAVIOR; TERM
AB This study examined the use of form and function analogy object boxes
   to teach second graders (n = 21) animal adaptations. The study used a
   pretest-posttest design to examine animal adaptation content learned
   through focused analogy activities as compared with reading and
   Internet searches for information about adaptations of animals followed
   by making an informative puppet play. Students participated in six
   week-long lesson sets, each addressing adaptations of two animals,
   which alternated between the two conditions. In the analogy condition,
   students matched cards explaining form and function analogies of animal
   body parts or homes to analogous manufactured items. They mapped
   analogies, thought of alternate manufactured items, and created new
   analogies. Students scored similarly on material to be taught through
   both conditions on the pretest, but made significantly higher posttest
   mean scores (76.1% analogy versus 57.2% traditional condition) with
   large effect size (partial eta(2) = 0.58) on animal adaptation content
   learned through the analogy activities. This study shows the usefulness
   of form and function analogies in teaching product innovations to
   second-grade students, indicating that early childhood students are
   able to successfully engage in sophisticated analogy activities.
   Efficacy of the analogy activities was related to objects that focused
   attention, motivated, and gave concrete representations of concepts; to
   cards and graphic organizers for organization, connections, and memory;
   and to complex thinking activities that challenged students and
   promoted peer interaction.

AB The interrelationship between senior high school students' science
   achievement (SA) and their self-confidence and interest in science
   (SCIS) was explored with a representative sample of approximately 1,044
   11th-grade students from 30 classes attending four high schools
   throughout Taiwan. Statistical analyses indicated that a statistically
   significant correlation existed between students' SA and their SCIS
   with a moderate effect size; the correlation is even higher with almost
   large effect sizes for a subsample of higher-SCIS and lower-SCIS
   students. Results of t-test analysis also revealed that there were
   significant mean differences in students' SA and their knowledge
   (including physics, chemistry, biology, and earth sciences subscales)
   and reasoning skill subtests scores between higher-SCIS and lower-SCIS
   students, with generally large effect sizes. Stepwise regression
   analyses on higher-SCIS and lower-SCIS students also suggested that
   both students' SCIS subscales significantly explain the variance of
   their SA, knowledge, and reasoning ability with large effect sizes.

AB This paper reports on the reality of classroom-based inquiry learning
   in science, from the perspectives of high school students and their
   teachers, under a national curriculum attempting to encourage authentic
   scientific inquiry (as practiced by scientists). A multiple case study
   approach was taken, utilising qualitative research methods of
   unobtrusive observation, semi-structured interviews and document
   analysis. The findings showed purposeful and focused learning
   occurring, but students were acquiring a narrow view of scientific
   inquiry where the thinking was characteristically rote and low-level.
   The nature of this learning was strongly influenced by curriculum
   decisions made by classroom teachers and science departments in
   response to the assessment requirements of a high stakes national
   qualification. As a consequence of these decisions, students
   experienced structured teaching programmes in which they were exposed
   to programme content that limited the range of methods that scientists
   use to fair testing and to pedagogies that were substantially didactic
   in nature. In addition, the use of planning templates and exemplar
   assessment schedules tended to reduce student learning about
   experimental design to an exercise in following the rules as they
   engaged in closed rather than open investigations. Thus, the resulting
   student learning was mechanistic and superficial rather than creative
   and critical, counter to the aims of the national curriculum policy
   that is intent on promoting students' knowledge and capabilities in
   authentic scientific inquiry.

TI Puppets promoting engagement and talk in science
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCHOOL SCIENCE; ARGUMENTATION; COLLABORATION; CLASSROOM
AB Research into classroom interactions has shown that talk that promotes
   reasoning can help children in their learning of science. Such talk can
   only be generated when teachers are willing to take a dialogic approach
   that is stimulating and provides opportunities for children to
   articulate their ideas. This research set out to determine whether the
   use of large puppets would help teachers to change the nature of their
   whole class discourse to enhance children's talk and engagement in
   science. The study was carried out with sixteen teachers of children
   aged 7-11 years in schools in London and Manchester, UK. Through
   adopting a mixture of research methods, including classroom observation
   and teacher and child interviews, the research provides evidence that
   the use of puppets significantly increases the amount of teacher
   discourse oriented towards reasoning and argument, and decreases the
   amount of talk that focuses on recall. Through the puppets, teachers
   also use more narrative to set the science in stimulating contexts, and
   encourage children in their contributions to whole class discussion.
   Interview data also show the positive effects of puppets on children's
   motivation and engagement in science. The findings have led to further
   major funding for professional development in the use of puppets in the
   UK, and research into the reasons why the use of puppets is so
   effective.

TI Religious beliefs: Their dynamics in two groups of life scientists
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The assumption that scientific knowledge would bring an end to
   religious belief has challenged many scholars, particularly since such
   a belief persists even among those devoted to scientific activities. In
   this paper the occurrence and nature of religious belief in groups of
   life scientists working in the UK and Brazil is discussed in the
   context of their degree of training. Data obtained through one-to-one
   interviews went beyond mere yes/no answers to questions on belonging to
   a religion or believing in God. Categories were created to assess how
   open these scientists were with regard to the possibility of the
   supernatural. The results suggest that scientific training affected
   their religious belief and reduced the number of believers.
   Nevertheless there were scientists in both groups whose beliefs
   persisted.

AB Recent advances in educational technologies and the wide-spread use of
   computers in schools have fueled innovations in test construction and
   analysis. As the measurement accuracy of a test depends on the quality
   of the items it includes, item selection procedures play a central role
   in this process. Mathematical programming and the item response theory
   (IRT) are often used in automating this task. However, when the item
   bank is very large, the number of item combinations increases
   exponentially and item selection becomes more tedious. To alleviate the
   computational complexity, researchers have previously applied heuristic
   search and machine learning approaches, including neural networks, to
   solve similar problems. This paper proposes a novel approach that uses
   abductive network modeling to automatically identify the
   most-informative subset of test items that can be used to effectively
   assess the examinees without seriously degrading accuracy. Abductive
   machine learning automatically selects only effective model inputs and
   builds an optimal network model of polynomial functional nodes that
   minimizes a predicted squared error criterion. Using a training dataset
   of 1500 cases (examinees) and 45 test items, the proposed approach
   automatically selected only 12 items which classified an evaluation
   population of 500 cases with 91%) accuracy. Performance is examined for
   various levels of model complexity and compared with that of
   statistical IRT-based techniques. Results indicate that the proposed
   approach significantly reduces the number of test items required while
   maintaining acceptable test quality. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Research on help seeking with a computer coach providing on-demand help
   has not produced fully adequate models of the process from a cognitive
   perspective. The present study postulates a model of help seeking from
   a cognitive perspective and tests this model in a learning situation
   characterized as problem-based and computer-supported. The participants
   were 18 graduate students from the faculty of Education of a Canadian
   university. Their participation involved solving a complex problem in
   statistics, in pairs, with the help of a computer coach, the McGill
   statistics tutor. Analysis of the performance data was performed using
   directed probability graphs and the log-linear approach. Results show
   that the model is reflected in the data. Implications for the design of
   computer coaches and instructional situations are discussed. (C) 2007

AB This paper summarises the outcomes of research that recorded and
   interpreted change in pre-service teachers' pedagogical beliefs when
   immersed in unique synchronous networked collaboration. The pre-service
   teachers were involved in the design and implementation of synchronous
   networked tasks, supported by the theoretical and pragmatic application
   of 'informed' Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
   integration. The pre-service teachers' use of digital technology
   graduated from a didactic, broadcast delivery of information to more
   constructivist strategies that involved interaction, collaboration and
   'good' learning. Moreover, the pre-service teachers gained competencies
   during a 12-week programme that led to the development of a suggested
   framework for ICT task development able to effectively promote and
   support improvements in learning. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

DE sensitivity to early exchange; problem solving; Cscl; convergence;
   fitness; participation inequity
AB This study reports the impact of high sensitivity to early exchange in
   11th-grade, CSCL triads solving well- and ill-structured problems in
   Newtonian Kinematics. A mixed-method analysis of the evolution of
   participation inequity (PI) in group discussions suggested that
   participation levels tended to get locked-in relatively early on in the
   discussion. Similarly, high (low) quality member contributions made
   earlier in a discussion did more good (harm) than those made later on.
   Both PI and differential impact of member contributions suggest a high
   sensitivity to early exchange; both significantly predicting the
   eventual group performance, as measured by solution quality.
   Consequently, eventual group performance could be predicted based on
   what happened in the first 30-40% of a discussion. In addition to
   drawing theoretical and methodological implications, implications for
   scaffolding CSCL groups are also discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

   hypertext: A design-based research study
SO COMPUTERS & EDUCATION

ID CAUSAL ATTRIBUTION; KNOWLEDGE; HYPERMEDIA; HISTORY
AB Learning in complex and ill-structured knowledge domains requires
   accommodation of multiple perspectives embedded in authentic activities
   and the reconciliation of those perspectives with personal beliefs
   resulting in conceptual change. Cognitive flexibility hypertext systems
   support that process by enabling learners to explore authentic cases
   from multiple thematic perspective. Study I showed that knowledge
   exploration alone is insufficient to engage those conceptual change
   processes. So we reasoned that providing learners with environments
   that engage more constructive, personal knowledge representation
   activities would better support conceptual change. However, these
   environments rarely support learners in structuring, integrating, and
   representing their personal beliefs with other perspectives. That
   became the goal of our iterative research process.
   We describe a design-based research study conducted over three years
   that chronicles the evolution of a hypertext information system into a
   collaborative knowledge construction environment. Situated in different
   subject areas and contexts, the project examined learner roles for
   interpreting and later representing and constructing their own complex,
   non-linear content structures. At the core of the project was an
   evolving hypertext authoring system, Crisscrossing, in which users in
   the latest version collaboratively construct non-linear hypertext
   structures as well as represent non-linear and sequential pathways
   through the content structures they construct.
   During each research cycle, we conducted extensive usability testing
   and utilized qualitative and quantitative research methods to describe
   changes in learners' roles and their effects on students' conceptual
   change while interpreting cases and producing and annotating their own
   cases. Learners consistently produced patterns of artifacts within and
   outside the environments, experienced poor transfer to new cases, and
   manifested difficulty in accommodating and creating multiple
   perspectives and applying causal reasoning. Implications for system
   design are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A literature review of the development of the information technology
   (IT) curriculum in recent decades in Hong Kong reveals that the aim of
   the curriculum has shifted from Computer Studies to the development of
   information literacy (IL). Based on a survey of all schools in Hong
   Kong and in response to the demand for IL in society, a curriculum
   framework is proposed that fosters the IL of students. The curriculum
   framework is based on the rationale of significant learning and
   designed on the principles of providing authenticity and creating
   reflection. It consists of three parts: a core IT curriculum; use of
   knowledge about IT and information processing across curricula; and a
   school culture that fosters IL. Four issues that are critical for the
   successful implementation of the proposed curriculum framework are
   discussed: school-based implementation models; the provision of service
   learning activities; support from parents; and reduction of the digital
   divide between students. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB E-learning environments increasingly serve as important infrastructural
   features of universities that enable teachers to provide students with
   different representations of knowledge and to enhance interaction
   between teachers and students and amongst students themselves. This
   study was designed to identify factors that can explain teachers' use
   of e-learning environments in higher education. A questionnaire was
   completed by 178 teachers from a wide variety of departments at
   Wageningen University in the Netherlands. We found that 43% of the
   total variance in teacher use of e-learning environments could be
   explained by their opinions about web-based activities and their
   opinions about computer-assisted learning (predictors) and the
   perceived added value of e-learning environments (mediating variable).
   In other words, teachers' use of e-learning environments can be
   explained to a high extent by their perceptions of the added value of
   these environments, which in turn are substantially influenced by their
   opinions about web-based activities and computer-assisted learning. (C)

TI Gridcole: A tailorable grid service based system that supports scripted

SO COMPUTERS & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE cooperative/collaborative learning; distributed learning environments
AB This paper introduces Gridcole, a new system that can be easily
   tailored by educators in order to support the realization of scripted
   collaborative learning situations. To do so, educators can provide a
   script specifying the sequence of activities to be performed by
   learners as well as the tools and documents required to support them.
   Gridcole can then search for these tools in a service-oriented grid in
   order to integrate them so that they are available for users during the
   realization of the situation. Significantly, Gridcole has two features
   that are not supported by other tailorable systems. First, it allows
   the integration of tools that use supercomputing capabilities or
   specific hardware resources, thus enabling the possibility of
   supporting many situations in which this type of tools is required.
   Besides, Gridcole can guide learners during the realization of
   collaborative learning situations according to the sequences of
   activities specified in the scripts. This way, learners can benefit
   from the advantages of scripted collaborative learning. Gridcole has
   been evaluated using three collaborative learning situations conceived
   for real courses at university level. The results of the evaluation
   show that Gridcole does provide the desired properties concerning tool
   integration and activity guidance as well as that the proposed system
   can provide adequate support for a wide range of collaborative learning
   situations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Internet and Web technology development have opened tip new ways
   for people to communicate, gain new information and increase their
   knowledge. One particular area of interest is that of using online
   resources to empower informal learners to increase their knowledge at
   their own time and space. One could look at an online resource as a
   public library being brought to the homes of such informal learners.
   The goal of the study described in this paper was to present evidence
   of the impact of online resources on such informal learners. In this
   study, the informal learners were a group of parents with young
   children aged between 0 and 6, and the knowledge being learned
   informally was that of their knowledge of and attitudes to their
   parenting skills. This study used an online parenting portal, KidzGrow
   Online, to identify if and how an online resource could impact on the
   group of parents with regard to the time they spent with their
   children, their own perceived level of knowledge of their children's
   development, and the level of their self-confidence in their parenting
   role. The study showed that after a period of three months, significant
   differences could be observed between the responses from parents who
   had access to the online resource and those from parents who did not.

AB This article discusses the factors which stimulate or limit the
   innovative use of ICT by teacher educators in the Netherlands.
   Innovative use of ICT is defined as the use of ICT applications that
   support the educational objectives based on the needs of the current
   knowledge society. Explorative path analysis and case studies were used
   to study the potential influencing factors. Results show that several
   factors on teacher level influence the implementation of innovative
   ICT-use in education. Especially, teachers who are so-called 'personal
   entrepreneurs' are important for the integration of ICT in teacher
   education. School level factors turn out to be of limited importance
   for innovative use of ICT. This indicates a limited involvement of the
   management of teacher training institutes towards the use of ICT within
   the curriculum. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this paper is to investigate students' attitudes towards
   the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in a
   reading skills course offered at Middle East Technical University,
   Ankara, Turkey. To this end, 30 first year students of the foreign
   language education (FLE) department followed a four-week component of
   an ICTs-integrated reading skills course. To examine the students'
   attitudes towards the course and the new learning environment at the
   end of the teaching period, an attitude questionnaire was administered
   and interviews were conducted. The findings indicate that despite the
   difficulties they faced, the students were satisfied overall with the
   application of ICTs in their reading course and developed positive
   attitudes towards online courses. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Despite the assumption that the integration of ICT influences the
   entire school system, research, focusing on ICT in schools is generally
   limited to the study of variables at class level. In contrast to these
   studies, the present research explores ICT integration from a school
   improvement approach. More particularly, it examines the local school
   policy with respect to ICT integration from both the principal's
   perspective and perceptions of teachers. Furthermore, it studies the
   relationship between school policies and the actual use of ICT in the
   classroom. To answer the research questions, a representative sample of
   53 primary school principals was interviewed. In addition, the
   interview data were supplemented with survey data of 574 teachers from
   the same 53 schools. What emerged from the analyses was that
   school-related policies, such as an ICT plan, ICT support and ICT
   training have a significant effect on class use of ICT. In addition,
   the findings from the interviews indicate that school policies are
   often underdeveloped and underutilised. The discussion section focuses
   on challenges to improve the potential of an ICT school policy. (C)
