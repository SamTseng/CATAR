# Content Analysis Toolkit for Academic Research (CATAR)

Notes:
1. The code here would be updated more earlier than those at: http://web.ntnu.edu.tw/~samtseng/CATAR/ (should be a few days earlier).
2. If you are clustering very short texts, co-word clustering would be very sensitive to the choice of the parameters (such as minimun thresholds of term occurrence) and the stop words.
3. The examples in the tutorials (CATAR_Tutorial.ppt or CATAR_Tutorial_en.ppt) use very low threshold values to get the results. After installation of CATAR on your computer, you should run sam.bat (under src sub-folder) to see if your results are almost the same as those in the tutorials.
