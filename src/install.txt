		Instatllation of Sam's Patent tools
					By Yuen-Hsien Tseng, 2007/01/19

* Note: This is a source code version. DO NOT distribute these files.

1. Unzip STPIWG.zip to a directory.
2. Install Perl (ActivePerl 5.8.8.817) and some of its modules:
  2.1 Download Perl v5.8 from http://www.ActiveState.com/
	then install Perl by clicking on the *.msi file.
  2.2 Install Perl's modules: DB_File, DBI, DBD::ODBC by running the commands:
  	ppm install DB_File
    	ppm install DBI
    	ppm install DBD-ODBC
    	ppm install Statistics-Regression
    	ppm install Math-MatrixReal
      under MS-DOS (while you are connecting to the Internet)
3. Install SAMtool by copying the directory SAMtool 
   or by unzipping SAMtool.zip to C:\Perl\lib.
   (Assume your Perl is installed on C:\Perl)
4. To use ISI.pl, copy Perl_Module\SVD.pm to C:\Perl\lib.
5. To use MDS.pm, you need the file mds.exe (already in the directory)
   and you need to install GD.pm.   To install GD, under DOS, run:
   D:\demo\STPIWG\src>ppm install Perl_Module/GD/GD.ppd
   or run:
   D:\demo\STPIWG\src>ppm install http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/GD.ppd 
   # Successfully installed GD version 2.35 in ActivePerl 5.8.8.817.
6. To use wntool.pm, you need to install Lingua/Wordnet.pm
 Method 1: (recommended)
   After installing WordNet 1.6 (Double clicking on wn16pc.exe 
     to create WNPCINST directory. In that directory, run setup.exe.)
   then copy d:\demo\STPIWG\src\Perl_Module\Lingua to c:\Perl\lib. That's it.
 or use Method 2: (only if you like to kill your time)
   1.1 double click wn16pc.exe to extract all the files and then
       double click on the extracted setup.exe to install WordNet 1.6.
       (You cannot run WordNet-2.1.exe or WordNet-1.7.1.exe,
        because they lack some files that are needed by Lingua-Wordnet-0.74.tar.gz)
   1.2 under DOS, run: 
        D:\demo\STPIWG\src>perl -s D:\Download\PerlWin\Lingua_WordNet\Lingua-Wordnet-0.74\scripts\convertdb_win.pl
        This program will convert your Wordnet databases into files usable by
        Lingua::Wordnet. This will not affect your existing Wordnet files, but
        will require up to 40MB disk space. Continue? [y]
        Data directory: [C:/WN16/DICT]
        Lingua::Wordnet needs to write the new files to a data directory.
        Where do you want these files saved?
        [C:/WN16/DICT/lingua-wordnet/] D:\demo\STPIWG\src\Lingua\WN1.6_dict
    1.3 Modify D:\Download\PerlWin\Lingua_WordNet\Lingua-Wordnet-0.74\Wordnet.pm
        $DICTDIR = 'C:\Perl\site\lib\WordNet\dic';
        into
        $DICTDIR = 'C:\Perl\lib\Lingua\WN1.6_dict';
    1.4 Copy Lingua-Wordnet-0.74\Wordnet.pm and Lingua-Wordnet-0.74\Wordnet\* to
        c:\Perl\lib\Lingua

The software installation steps have finished. 
You may ignore the following steps at this moment. (2006/11/06)




Next steps are for downloading US patents into Access.

4. Copy PatentDB2_org.mdb to a new file (such as NSC_PatentDB.mdb).
   Note: You'd better copy PatentDB2_org.mdb to a new file each time
   	 you download a set of patents for a new project.
   	 So do not modify PatentDB2_org.mdb.
5. Set the DSN (Data Source Name) via Windows' control pannel 
  ]北睽x=>t参恨zuㄣ=>戈屁臃(ODBC)=>t参戈屁臃溅W嘿^
   to let Windows know where to find the new Access file.
   For example, set a DSN=NSC_PatentDB for the file NSC_PatentDB.mdb.
6. Edit Patent.ini. You may copy and paste the attributes 
   in the [Nano] group and modify its 
   'PatentDir' (where you store the full patents) and 
   'DNS' attributes to let it become [NSC], for example.
   If you are going to download US patents via a proxy server, set the
   'ProxyServerURL' attribute's value. (Remember to delete the
   remark sign '#' before 'ProxyServerURL=...'.)
   Do not change the other parts if you do not know their functions.
7. Prepare a list of patent numbers in a file for the patents 
   you want to download. You may use IPAM to create the list of 
   patent numbers. Assume the list of patent number is saved in 
   NSC_PatentNo.txt (each number per line) and the group name 
   in Patent.ini is [NSC], then run this command under DOS:
	perl -s Patent.pl -Ogroup=NSC -Odb -OPat2DB NSC_PatentNo.txt
   The patents will be downloaded, parsed, and saved in the Access file.
8. To index the parsed segments by WebGenie, edit indexSave.ini
   by changing the dsn in the line: (assume dsn=NSC_PatentDB)
	DBSourceName=dsn=NSC_PatentDB;uid=;pwd=;
   Then import indexSave.ini into WebGenie, make index in WebGenie.

That's it. If you have any questions, ask for help at: tseng@lins.fju.edu.tw
   or 0915208787.


A check list of the required files and directoies:
   Patent.pm : This Perl module implements a class to download, parse, and 
        analyze (extract abstracts and keywords) patent documents 
        (currently it only apply to USPTO website).
	This module saves the downloaded patents in the file system.
   PatentDB.pm : This is a DBMS version of Patent.pm. Furthermore, this module
	parse the patents into more detailed information for DBMS analysis.
   Patent.ini : All the settings are kept in this file. You can edit it for
	different parameters of the application.
   PatentDB.mdb : an ACCESS DB that has data loaded after running PatentDB.pm.
        This file may not be included in this application.
   PatentDB2_org.mdb : an empty ACCESS DB that can be copied for different 
        patent set. You may copy this file to PatentDB.mdb to have a new 
        and empty database.
   Patent.pl : Example codes of using the above modules.
	You can run this file in DOS or in CGI enviroment (see below).
   ParseSciRef.pm : A Perl module to parse the scientific paper citations.
   ParseSciRef.pl : A example of how to use ParseSciRef.pm. You don't need
   	this file. The functions in ParseSciRef.pm are automatically called
   	in Patent.pm.
   PatentDir/ : contain some Patents from USPTO for testing the &Parse_Patent()
   	You may run: 
   	perl -s patent.pl -Ofile -Odebug OutDir PatentDir\4810662.htm
   	to see if patent 4810662 is parsed correctly or not by viewing 
   	OutDir\4810662.htm with a browser.
   SAMtool/* : a set of Perl modules and data for analyzing unstructured text
	(including segmenting, key-phrase extraction, related term extraction,
	abstracting) 
	You should unzip SAMtool.zip to c:\Perl\lib if your perl is 
	installed at c:\Perl.
   SegWordPat.pm : the special version of the above for the patent application.
   (StemTerms.txt : If you like, add stemmed phrases (or words) here and run:
   	"perl -s SegWord.pm -DicDBM StemTerms.txt" to create next 2 files)
   StopPatWord-eng.txt : list of stop word used by SegWordPat.pm.
   	You need this file in the execution directory.
   SubFields.txt : Those sections that are not recognized when calling 
    	&ParsePatent() in Patent.pm. This file is automatically created
    	by &ParsePatent() in Patent.pm for debugging purpose.
